The Mayor feels the most challenging part of his job is making sure voters' voices are heard and planning for their long-term needs and dreams.

Mahoney enjoys meeting residents and learning more about the issues that will affect the City's future. "The citizens of Fargo are wonderful and want to make it a better place to live," Mahoney said.

**Professional and educational background**

He holds degrees from the University of Notre Dame, Tufts University, the University of North Dakota and Harvard University.

**Personal background**  
The Mayor was born in Devils Lake, North Dakota and has lived in Fargo since 1980.

He is married to Kathy Mahoney, a registered nurse. The couple has four children (Ryan, Kaileen, Colin and Dylan) and seven grandchildren.

"We are a very active family and enjoy all that Fargo offers," Mahoney said.
