He holds degrees from the University of Notre Dame, Tufts University, the University of North Dakota and Harvard University.

**Personal background**  
The Mayor was born in Devils Lake, North Dakota and has lived in Fargo since 1980.

He is married to Kathy Mahoney, a registered nurse. The couple has four children (Ryan, Kaileen, Colin and Dylan) and seven grandchildren.

"We are a very active family and enjoy all that Fargo offers," Mahoney said.
