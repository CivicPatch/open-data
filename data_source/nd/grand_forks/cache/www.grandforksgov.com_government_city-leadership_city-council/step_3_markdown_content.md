The Grand Forks City Council consists of 7 members, each representing one of the city's 7 wards.Â  The Grand Forks City Council meets the 1st and 3rd Monday's of every month at 5:30 pm.Â  The council meetings are televised LIVE on GFTV Channel 2,

The members of the Grand Forks City Council serve 4 year terms and are elected by those within their ward.Â  The City Council has what is called "plenary powers" so it mainly acts as the legislative body.Â  That means they are responsible for making laws, ordinances and policies.Â  In this way they are also referred to as the policy-making body.Â  This is different from the Mayor, who is the head administrator of the city and makes sure the policies established by the council are properly carried out and adhered to.
