### City Commission Minutes

June 3, 2025 &amp; June 12, 2025 Special Meeting

4:00 pm

**Minutes of the Regular City Commission Meeting held on June 17, 2025 at City Hall at 4:00 PM.**

**Present:** Lyn James, Vice-Chair Ryan Shear, Benjamin Schaaf, Sara Bullis, Chief Headley, Steve Ness, Todd Hofland, Shannon Hewson, Brad Mosher, Peggy Allen, and Bill Feigel.  **Absent:** Myron Vail and Aaron Allen.

President James called the meeting order at 4:00 pm.  Motion by Shear, second by Schaff to approve the amended agenda.  RCV= all aye, MC.

                **Direct Deposit:** $36,213.60; **Checks #**14474-14508; **Voided Checks:** 14478 – 14481; **Bills:** BCDC $65,640.00, Morgan Foss $675.00, Hawkins $784.84, S &amp; T Plumbing $204.71, AT &amp; T $788.42, BCDC $357.89, Bowman Vet Clinic $176.28, Brosz Engineering $1,395.00, Cenex Fleet Card $5,004.49, Consolidated Telecom $1,060.03, Coyle Electric $52,194.67, EIDO Connect $108.00, Fallon County Treasurer $7,117.25, Ferguson Waterworks $2,040.00, James Cabinet $2,166.46, John Deere Financial $58.88, Mendoza Plumbing $250.00, ND Information Technology $88.10, Newman Traffic Signs $216.75, One Call $186.00, Peggy Allen $109.20, Roughrider Septic $405.00, Slope Electric $1,345.00, State of ND Chemistry Lab $64.09, SW Ag $224.00, SW District Health Unit $50.00, Trowel and Hammer $3,940.80, Troy Nogosek $350.60, Waddington Boom Truck $4,000.00, Western Frontier Insurance $128.00, and Westlie Crossroads Truck Center $5,960.12.

**BROSZ ENGINEERING – HEWSON:**

                 **Water Tank Project:** We got the Geotechnical Report back for the water tank land and it was ok, so Brosz Engineering is working on the structural design, figuring out where the tank is going to be placed and then will keep moving forward on the project.

Hewson has been working on a few other things for us too.

**HOFLAND – STREET/VECTOR/LANDFILL DEPTS.:**

**Dept. Head Report:** The crew started using the durapatcher today and had to fix it right away, another hose needs to be fixed.  If it blows up before the hose gets here, they will be done durapatching.

                **Landfill Employee Position:** Due to a personnel matter, we have had a recent change in staffing.  Shear hired a 17-year-old to get us through the summer.  Due to his age, he isn’t allowed to run equipment until he is 18, so Hofland will run the loader when necessary.  Once the new hire starts school, we could then use one of our crew to get us through the summer.

                **Motor Grader Extended Warranties:** The Commission would like to table the extended warranties on the 2018 John Deere motor grader until they get more clarification on the warranty plans.

**NESS -WATER AND SEWER DEPT.:**

                **Dept Head Report: Hydrants** are finished being flushed, the boulevard sprinklers had to be shut off to fix one of the heads and are back on.

**CHIEF HEADLEY – POLICE DEPT.:**

**Activity Report for 6/2/25 – 6/15/25:   Incidents** – 5 (traffic stop-2, criminal mischief, DUI drugs, or alcohol, and narcotics paraphernalia possession), **Calls for Service** – 36 (violation of City Ordinance-8, suspicious person or circumstance-4, information report-2, agency assistance-2, suspicious vehicle or circumstance-2, 911 hang-up call, 2, extra patrol-2, traffic complaint, lost property, citizen assist, criminal mischief, reckless driver, direct traffic, DUI alcohol or drugs, public relations, animal noise, harassing phone call/letter, vicious animal, stray animal depriving owner of vehicle, and citizen dispute); **Traffic Stops**-49 (verbal warning-20, citation-12, written warning-11, Arrest-4 and no action-2; **Arrests:** 4 (Driving under influence/driving while license suspended-2, and drug equipment/paraphernalia.)

**Car Show**:  Headley stated that we are a member of an organization that will let us use a couple of cameras that could be mounted on a pole or something that will at least give us video in the event of an incident, assault or a car being damaged, etc.  They will be borrowed; there is no cost to us, the Commission thought it would be a good idea.

**SILVER DOLLAR-FEIGEL:**

**Special Events:** Feigel said his last event went well, he had a security guy at the door.  He would like to have two more events this summer, July 18 and Aug. 15, both on Fridays.  His events would consist of having musical entertainment in the old Urban Obsession building so he doesn’t have to worry about the weather with the events normally being outside.  He is asking to serve alcohol at the event.

James was worried about bathrooms since there is only one in that building, but Feigel put three outhouses out front that were removed in the morning.  He also had hand cleaner for the port a potties.  He stated that he would put up exit signs to point to both exits.  Headley asked him to have a person at the door counting people, so he doesn’t exceed capacity. Feigel felt it was a good idea, and he will check into it.  The Commission was okay with the events and asked him to just get a special event permit from Allen for these events.

**ALLEN – FINANCIAL AUDITOR:**

**Bond Resolution 2025-B-14:** Allen presented the bond resolution for bonding the city employees that handle money.  Motion by Shear, second by Schaaf to approve Resolution 2025-B-14 For Bonding the City Employees.  RCV= all aye, MC.

**Zoning Issue on a Shed:** The Zoning Commission tried to resolve an issue with a shed not being moved as it is in a side and front yard which is against the ordinance.  A problem has been discovered that the owner of the property is a deceased person.  Shear and Allen will work on a letter to send to the property owner’s personal representative of the estate and will have the police department deliver.

**Municipal Highway Transfer:** Allen requested to transfer the remaining salary shortfall funds that were budgeted.  Motion by Shear, second by Schaaf to approve the transfer as presented for the municipal highway in the amount of $89,500.00.  RCV= all aye, MC.

**Cemetery Budgeted Funds Request:** The Cemetery Board is requesting a levy in the amount of $10,000.00.  This will be added to the budgeting meeting for consideration.

**Chicken Complaints:** There have been complaints about chickens in the extra territorial zone.  City ordinances do not allow chickens.  Allen will invite the property owner to the next meeting to talk about chickens.

**6th Street NW and NE and 11th Ave NW:** James, Allen and Hofland met with the County to go over the proposed Memorandum of Understanding for these roads.  Day to day maintenance on 11Th Avenue NW starting at the railroad tracks to Farm to Market Road also known as 6th St NW will be maintained by the City along with 6th Street NE from the North Main Street approach to the dead end of 6th Street NE.  This does not include 6th Street NE starting at 3rd Avenue NE. Major repairs would be on cost share basis, based on linear feet on both 6th Street NW and 11th Avenue NW shared with the County.  The County will do day-to-day maintenance on 6th Street NW ending at the North Main Street approach.  The County wants to meet to discuss some other roads also.  The County approved the agreement.  Motion by Schaaf, second by Shear to approve signing the Memorandum of Understanding between the City and the County regarding 6th Street NW and NE and 11th Ave NW.  RCV= all aye, MC.

**CLOSE OF MEETING:**

**Next Meeting:** 7/1/25 at 4:00 pm

Motion by Shear, second by Schaaf to approve the bills, May 2025 Financials, 6/3/25 Meeting Minutes and 6/12/25 Special Meeting Minutes.

President James adjourned the meeting.
