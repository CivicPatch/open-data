A proud Fort Worth native and award-winning community leader, Dr. Mia Hall has dedicated her life to giving back to our city. With 24 years of experience as an educator, she has played a transformative role in shaping the lives of generations of children in Fort Worth ISD, where she currently serves as the Executive Director of Strategic Recruitment.

Dr. Hall holds a doctorate in educational leadership from Mary Hardin-Baylor and is a former public school teacher, principal, a National Blue Ribbon Award recipient, and a former Crowley ISD School Board Trustee. She served on the board ten years, including two years as President. During her tenure, Crowley ISD innovated its curriculum, improved its facilities, and opened a state-of-the-art career and technical education center. She also founded the Young Women’s Leadership Academy, helping to provide life-changing educational opportunities for young girls.

In 2023, Dr. Hall was named Volunteer of the Year by the Junior League of Fort Worth for her dedication to advancing opportunities for children and families. Dr. Hall also serves on the Board of Directors for United Way of Tarrant County, and she previously served on the Board for Girls, Inc. of Tarrant County and the City of Fort Worth Zoning Commission.

Dr. Hall and her husband, Ibo, have been married for 24 years and are the proud parents of their son, Xavier, a senior at Texas Wesleyan University.
