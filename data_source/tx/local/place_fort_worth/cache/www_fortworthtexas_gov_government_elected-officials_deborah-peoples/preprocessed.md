![Official CFW Headshot CM Peoples D5 (002).jpg](https://www.fortworthtexas.gov/files/assets/public/v/1/government/images/official-cfw-headshot-cm-peoples-d5.jpg?dimension=pageimage&w=480)

Fort Worth City Councilmember Deborah Peoples was elected in May 2025 to represent District 5 – East Fort Worth. Deborah Peoples was born and raised during a time of great change for Fort Worth and America.
Participating in the Civil Rights movement and peacefully marching for justice inspired Deborah to fight for what’s right at an early age, and she’ll continue that fight as the dedicated representative for Fort Worth City Council, District 5.

Deborah’s courage in her convictions led her to excel in school. She went on to earn her Bachelor of Science and Master of Business Administration from Texas Woman’s University.
Deborah Peoples is a former AT&T executive, responsible for managing over 5,000 staff members in 22 states. Councilmember Deborah Peoples brings her experience of managing large operations and growing businesses to City Hall.

While working, Deborah started a family and deepened her relationships in her church community. Compassion and conviction guided Deborah’s relationships with her loved ones and her faith, and those same values will influence her leadership of Fort Worth City Council, District 5.
She also devoted herself more directly to working in the community, including more than a decade of service as Chair of the Tarrant County Democratic Party. Her time as chair was marked by increased civic engagement and voter turnout, both essential in the work of empowering disenfranchised communities.
Deborah is a proud mother of two highly successful daughters, a University Professor and a Film Producer, and enjoys spending time with partner Rodney Stanley.
