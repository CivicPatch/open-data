Fort Worth has a council-manager government. Under the form, an elected governing body, usually called a
[city council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_council "City council")
will have elections held every two years for a
[mayor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Fort_Worth "Mayor of Fort Worth")
, elected at large, and ten council members, elected by district.

The mayor is a voting member of the council and represents the city on ceremonial occasions. The council has the power to adopt
municipal ordinances
and resolutions, make proclamations, set the city tax rate, approve the city budget, and appoint the city secretary, city attorney, city auditor, municipal court judges, and members of city boards and commissions.

The day-to-day operations of city government are overseen by the city manager, who is also appointed by the council.
