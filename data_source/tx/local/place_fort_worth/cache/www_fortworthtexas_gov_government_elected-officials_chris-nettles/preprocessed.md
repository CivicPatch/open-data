Pastor Chris Nettles is a lifelong resident of Fort Worth and believes in devoting his time to his family, business, and community. He and his wife, Shakia Nettles, are the proud parents of four children: Jalen, Christopher Jr. (CJ), Caleb, and the princess, Christianna Nettles.

Chris is a proud graduate of North Crowley High School (class of 2006) where he was the President of his Junior Class and President of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA) program. Following his graduation, Chris studied Christian Ministries at Dallas Baptist University.

Since 2014, Chris Nettles has owned and operated his daycare center, Haven of Purpose Childcare Center, which provides care, education, nutritious meals, mentorship, and so much more to the children of working families in Fort Worth. Chris’s business is run alongside of his ministry, where he has served as the senior Pastor and played an active role in the community for the past eleven years. More recently, in 2019, Pastor Chris expanded his afterschool program to providing after-school care and hot meals for the students of Everman ISD, surrounding Churches and apartments complexes.

From 2013 – 2020, Chris worked as an Administrative Court Clerk and Assistant Court Manager to Justice of the peace for Tarrant County Precinct Eight. This profession has allowed him to be a role model and mentor to the young men and women that came through the court system.
