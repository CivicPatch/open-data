With his varied background, Michael brings a dynamic range of qualities that define his service to Fort Worth and its residents. He earned a B.A. from Texas A&M University’s Mays Business School, a J.D. from Texas A&M University School of Law, and an M.B.A. from Rutgers Business School. His diverse education reflects both business acumen and policy expertise. Michael launched his professional journey in government administration and public policy, experience that continues to shape his strategic approach as a principal with a local real estate firm.

Michael’s deep love for Fort Worth is evident in both his public service and his advocacy for local businesses and neighborhoods. A recognized champion of government efficiency, fiscal responsibility and lowering property taxes, Michael is committed to ensuring Fort Worth remains an attractive and affordable place to live, work and do business. Recently, he has played a visible role in driving initiatives including community health projects, supporting new medical facilities in areas of need and collaborating to foster economic development during a period of record growth city-wide. His leadership on the City Council has focused on issues ranging from retail revitalization and food security to public safety and law enforcement, including the recent selection process for Fort Worth’s new police chief and efforts to build greater community trust.

Through his official duties as Councilman, Michael serves on numerous boards and committees that shape civic progress and regional planning in North Texas. He is Chair of the Legislative & Intergovernmental Affairs Committee and a member of the Public Safety and Infrastructure & Growth Committees. His regional leadership includes serving on the North Central Texas Council of Governments Regional Transportation Committee (RTC) and its Executive Committee, as well as the Trinity Metro Board of Directors. Michael is very involved with Fort Worth Sister Cities International and represents Fort Worth on the NAS-JRB Fort Worth Regional Coordinating Committee (RCC). He is actively engaged with multiple local improvement and development organizations, including PID #21 (Las Vegas Trail), PID #19 (Camp Bowie), Walsh and Veale Ranch TIFs, and the boards of the Fort Worth Local Development Corporation, Central City Local Development Corporation, Lone Star Local Development Corporation, Fort Worth Housing Finance Corporation and the Crime Control & Prevention District.

With his background at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing as Chief of Staff and prior service in President George W. Bush’s administration, Michael excels as a problem solver and innovator. Through real estate, he leverages his legal expertise to negotiate successful deals and guide clients through complex transactions.

Recently featured in news reports for his work with neighborhood revitalization, support for dementia education and care, and championing volunteer and charitable efforts, Michael’s commitment to service is widely recognized. Honors include repeated recognition as one of Fort Worth Texas Magazine’s Top 400 Most Influential, Entrepreneur of Excellence, Philanthropist of the Year by Fort Worth Business Press, and Community Advocate of the Year by the Fort Worth Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. He continues to serve on boards and advisory committees including LVT Rise and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society and past board positions with Fort Worth Sister Cities International, The Texas Lyceum, and the Fort Worth Food + Wine Foundation.

From strengthening local commerce and supporting vulnerable communities to leading public conversations for a safer, more vibrant Fort Worth, Michael remains deeply invested in opening doors and building opportunity. He is inspired daily by his wife Joanna and their energetic children Mackaylee, Mackenzie, and Ainsley.
