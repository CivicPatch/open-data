City Manager
============

The Council/Manager form of government was chosen by a vote of the citizens and established in the City Charter.

* Mayor and City Council are equivalent to the chairman and board of directors.
* The city manager is equivalent to the CEO.

As the legislative body elected by citizens, City Council establishes policies based on the entire community's vision.

The City Manager is appointed by City Council to implement these policies and provide direction to employees for day-to-day operations.

The city manager shall be the chief executive officer and the head of the administrative branch of the city government. He shall be responsible to the city council for the proper administration of all affairs of the city and to that end he shall have the power and shall be required to:

* (a) Appoint and, when necessary for the good of the service, remove all officers and employees of the city except as otherwise provided by this charter and except as he may authorize the head of a department and office to appoint and remove subordinates in such department or office;

* (b) Prepare the budget annually and submit it to the city council and be responsible for its administration after adoption;
* (c) Prepare and submit to the city council as of the end of the fiscal year, a complete report on the finances and administrative activities of the city for the preceding year;
* (d) Keep the city council advised of the financial condition and future needs of the city and make such recommendations as may seem to him desirable;
