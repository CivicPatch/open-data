![](https://cityofhackberry.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/City-of-Hackberry-Original-City-Hall-300x200.jpg)
In 1983 Hackberry was incorporated. During that time we had poor roads, poor water supply and failing septic systems through out the city. In 1987 the first official Hackberry City Hall was constructed by city leaders and citizens. The materials and labor were donated by Danny and Jean Buckalew, Brenda Lewallen, Arlene Ranegar, Jerry Davis, Bill Quakenbush, Ike Turner, Andy and Nancy Shores, Donna Draper, Greg and Gracie Mattocks, Gene Brown, Teri Brouillette, Pat Daniels, and many others that City records do not reflect.

Our second City Hall was purchased in 1994. The City of Hackberry moved into their new City Hall May 2012. As of current, we have seen a new water system, new sewer systems, road improvements and much more. We now supply water and sewer to over 1000 customers. The City plans to have all the roads resurfaced in the near future.

**As the City grows, there will be more improvements to our community with new homes, roads, and upgrades to the water system and wastewater plant.**

So come join the City of Hackberry as we continue to flourish and grow.

Est. population inside City limits as of 2013: 998

Hackberry was incorporated in 1983 as a Type B General Law municipality with the name of Town of Hackberry. In 2001, Hackberry met all the requirements to become a Type A General Law municipality. Upon becoming a Type A General Law municipality, the name was changed to City of Hackberry.

The governing body is made up of a City Council (Board of Aldermen) consisting of five (5) Council Members (Aldermen) and a Mayor. The Council and Mayor are elected at large with staggering terms of two years. The City established the office of City Administrator in 2007. The City Administrator has the basic responsibilities of a City Manager.

The Council meets the second Tuesday each month at 7:00 p.m. to conduct city business. The meetings are held at City Hall, 119 Maxwell Road (west side of the street), Hackberry, Texas. Meetings are open to the public. Agendas are posted just outside the front door of City Hall for the public’s information. Posting on the website is also our goal, but they are always posted in this location even when not available on the website.
