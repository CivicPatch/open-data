###### [\*ATTENTION: Water Leak Policies – Need to know](https://cityofhackberry.net/notice/attention-water-leak-policies-need-to-know/ "*ATTENTION: Water Leak Policies – Need to know")

Hackberry Water Services(HWS) is well aware of the concerns of our customers. The water department  strives to provide all our customers with the best quality water available in our area.  
  
In the past few years, HWS has  seen severe drought conditions not only locally but throughout the country. With the drought conditions, the ground gets dry and shifts causing major water leaks.



The Water Department tries to address these water leak issues as quickly as possible, prioritizing the Main Line water leaks first.. Sometimes it requires the Water Department to shut off the Main Lines that feed certain communities to facilitate making these repairs. There is no way to make contact with the water customers in those communities.  HWS apologizes for any inconvenience this may be  to our customers.



If for some reason you are experiencing a water leak in your yard be aware that it is most likely a line running to your home from the meter. These leaks are the responsibility of the home owner  to have repaired. Any water loss is also the responsibility of the water customer. To try and keep your water loss at a minimum from the leak, please contact HWS at 972-292-3223 during normal business hours 8:00 am to 5 pm. (after hour water emergency 214-397-6806) to have the water shut off before repairs.



**\*\*\*HACKBERRY DOES NOT HAVE A POLICY TO APPLY CREDITS DUE TO LEAKS OR THEFT!\*\*\***

###### [Help Prevent Clogged Sewers](https://cityofhackberry.net/notice/help-prevent-clogged-sewers/ "Help Prevent Clogged Sewers")

Clogged Sewer Lines are no fun for anyone. Here are some tips to help keep them flowing smooth.



Think Before You Flush:  
​  
Next time you go to toss that “flushable” wipe in the toilet, you might want to consider not doing so. City Sewers in the area and across the country say the rapidly growing use of pre-moistened “personal” wipes — used most often by potty-training toddlers and people seeking what’s advertised as a more “thorough” cleaning than toilet paper — are clogging pipes & jamming pumps. Utilities struggling with aging infrastructure have wrestled for years with the problem of “ragging” — when baby wipes, dental floss, paper towels and other items NOT designed for flushing entangle sewer pumps. “Just because you can flush it doesn’t mean you should,” So when in doubt, what should you flush? It might sound blunt, but utility officials recommend sticking with the “three P’s”: pee, poop and (toilet) paper.  
​Cease the Grease



1. Remove oil and grease from all dishes and pans before washing. Once cooled,scrape and wipe off excess grease.
2. Once grease or cooling oil has cooled, pour into covered collection containers. Never pour oil and grease down the drain.
3. Cover kitchen sink with catch baskets (strainers) and empty into trash can as needed.
4. Don’t rinse off oil and grease from pots and pans with hot water. When the water cools the grease will congeal and could cause a backup. Instead, wipe the grease off with a paper towel, dispose of the paper towel in your regular garbage, then wash.
5. Scrape food scraps from dishes into a trash can to avoid using your garbage disposal.
6. Used cooling oil can be harmful to your sewer. Why not recycle it?
7. Visit [www.ceasethegreasetx.com](http://www.ceasethegreasentx.com/) for more information.
8. While many “flush-able” items (baby wipes) may not clog your pipes, they can easily clog lift station pumps resulting in costly repairs and increasing the potential for sewer overflows. Many manufacturers claim these so-called “flush-able” items biodegrade and are sewer and septic safe, but the reality is that they arrive at the treatment plant intact causing damage to screens, motors, and pumps that require expensive repairs. The City of Celeste highly encourages you to dispose of these items with your regular garbage. When you put cooking waste like foods, oil, and grease (F.O.G.) down the drain, it clings to the side of your sewer pipes and can cause clogs in your lines, which may result in an expensive visit from the plumber. Grease can also clog the city’s main sewer lines and make it harder to treat wastewater. The cost of cleaning and repairs contributes to the rates that you pay for sewer service. Clogs can also cause sewer back-ups which are a hazard to the environment as well as public health.
