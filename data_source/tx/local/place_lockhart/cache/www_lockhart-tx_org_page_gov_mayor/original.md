The Mayor's Welcome

Welcome to Lockhart, Texas! The Little City with the BIG HEART!

Lockhart is a favorite in Central Texas for great day trips and weekend destinations. Located conveniently between Austin and San Antonio, just 15 miles east of San Marcos off IH 35.  You can drive here easily on Hwy 183 or the 130 Tollway from anywhere in Texas!

From cattle drives to Indian fights to oil wells and agriculture and ranching, Lockhart has a rich and colorful history. Come visit our bustling historic square featuring one of the most photographed courthouses in Texas and our Dr. Eugene Clark Library, the oldest continually used library in the state. Both have undergone complete historic renovations which will take you a step back in time as you walk through them.

The square is alive and well with many thriving businesses, a vibrant entertainment district, and unique shopping. Find hidden treasures in our antique shops, perfect gifts in our one of a kind boutique stores, or dine or sample a beverage in our growing list of restaurants and bars.

Come visit us for our exciting festivals such as Cowtown Sip & Stroll, Cinco de Mayo, Chisholm Trail Roundup, Diez y Seis, Dickens Celebration and the Texas Western Swing Hall of Fame Festival.

Lockhart continues to be a lively and energetic community with eyes on the future. Business and housing opportunities abound. Our school district continues to be recognized for its excellence and commitment to its teachers and students. With our steady growth, we stand ready to welcome even more families and businesses looking for an escape from the hassles of big city life!

Of course…………you could just come here to eat BAR-B-Q at Kreuz, Blacks, Smitty’s, Chisholm Trail, and even our newest Thumpers! You can’t go wrong with a plate from any of theses places! That’s why we are the Bar-B-Q Capital of Texas! USA! World !!!
