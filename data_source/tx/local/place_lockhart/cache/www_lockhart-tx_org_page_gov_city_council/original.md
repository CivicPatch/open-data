City Council Members  
  
The City of Lockhart is chartered as a home rule city in the State of Texas. Local government is administered through a council-manager form of government. Citizens are represented on the City Council by seven elected Councilmembers; four from single Councilmember districts, two At-Large Positions, and a Mayor, who is elected At-Large. The Council appoints one of its members as a Mayor Pro-Tem to chair the council in the absence of the Mayor. The Mayor is recognized as the head of city government for ceremonial and emergency purposes and is a voting member of the Council.

The City Council responsibilities include setting policy, adopting local ordinances, setting the tax rate, approving the budget and approving major land transactions. The Council also appoints citizen members of boards and commissions, the City Manager, Municipal Judge, and the City Attorney.   
  
Lockhart's mayor and councilmembers are elected for three-year staggered terms.
