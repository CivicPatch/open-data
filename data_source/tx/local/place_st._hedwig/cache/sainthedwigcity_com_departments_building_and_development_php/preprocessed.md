BUILDING AND DEVELOPMENT

The City's Code Compliance  emphasizes compliance over enforcement.
Our personnel seek first to educate the residents about Saint Hedwig codes to gain voluntary compliance.
Notices of Violation (NOV) are part of the education process but can result in citation or other court action if ignored.

Prior to any Excavation, Construction or Remodel, Repair
the homeowner or builder shall submit an application to the City and
obtain the required permit in accordance with the Ordinances of the City.
PLEASE NOTE: A copy of the
will be required with the application packet
for new residential builds, extended family quarters and residential
remodels/additions over 25% as required in the Subdivision Ordinance.
If the property has not been platted, the property owner will need to contact an
engineer regarding that process.
***For all building permit information & inquiries, please send email to:***
