City Council Meetings
---------------------

* The City Council meets on the third Tuesday of each month at 3:00 p.m.
* City Hall Council Chambers is located at 1 Community Drive, Horseshoe Bay, TX 78657

The City of Horseshoe Bay was incorporated in 2005 and is a Home Rule City with a Council/Manager form of government. The City Council consists of a Mayor and five Council Members.

City Council Meetings
---------------------

A typical City Council meeting begins with the Mayor determining that a quorum (at least 3 members) is present. The Mayor then calls the meeting to order. Following an invocation and the Pledges of Allegiance, City Council begins the official business of the meeting. Proclamations, Staff Recognition, Presentations, and Public Comments are addressed first. Next, the Council holds Public Hearings and considers Business items. Finally, the Council considers the Consent agenda, monthly departmental reports, and (if applicable) Executive Session items. Consent agenda items include routine, non-controversial items such as the approval of meeting minutes or the purchase of equipment and supplies already approved in the annual budget. The Council may, or may not, convene into Executive Session (closed meeting) if necessary prior to adjourning the meeting, even if Executive Session is not posted on the agenda. For information on citizen participation at City Council meetings, please
go to the "Appearing Before the Council" page
.

The City Council may go into Executive Session (closed meeting) at any time during public meetings, even if Executive Session is not listed as an agenda item, to discuss any matter as authorized by Texas Government Code Sections 551.071 (Consultation with City Attorney), 551.072 (Deliberations Regarding Real Property), 551.073 (Deliberations Regarding Gifts and Donations), 551.074 (Personnel Matters), 551.076 (Deliberations Regarding Security Devices), and 551.086 (Economic Development). Texas law does not permit the public to be present during Executive Session.

An agenda for a Regular or Special City Council meeting must, by state law, be posted at least 72 continuous hours prior to the beginning of that particular meeting. The lone exception involves matters of an emergency nature, which must be posted for at least 1 hour prior to the start of the meeting.

For the convenience of all citizens, copies of meeting agendas are posted on the bulletin board outside the main door of City Hall and on the City’s website in the
Agenda Center
. At City Council meetings, a copy of the agenda will be available for citizens prior to the start of the meeting.

Please review the "
Appearing Before the Council
" web page for information on citizen participation at City Council meetings. There is a specific time set aside for Public Comment during Regular City Council meetings, when citizens may address the Council. If you wish to speak during a City Council meeting, you must sign up on the Sign-In sheet available at each meeting, PRIOR to the start of the meeting. In order to maintain order, and out of respect for everyone in attendance, citizens are not allowed to speak openly, to speak out of turn, or to interrupt the Mayor, Council Members, staff, or other speakers during a City Council meeting unless called upon by the presiding officer - typically the Mayor. We welcome and encourage citizens to attend and participate at City Council meetings; however, any disruptions will result in the offending party being removed from the Council Chambers. If you sign up to speak prior to the start of the meeting, you will have an equal opportunity to be heard.

If you have any questions about City Council meetings, please contact City Secretary Susie Quinn by
[email](mailto:squinn@horseshoe-bay-tx.gov)
or by phone at 830-598-9943.
