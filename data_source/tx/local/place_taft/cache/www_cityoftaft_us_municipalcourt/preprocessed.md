Courtroom Standards

The Judge cannot speak to you about your case except when your case is being heard and the other party is present. The court staff will help you in any way they can regarding the process of your case(s) but cannot give any legal advice or recommendations on what you should do.

The Court has a very busy schedule so you must be on time for the Judge. If you are late, your case may be postponed or you could be required to post bond for a new date. Make sure you bring all the court documents and information you need to support your case. It is important to have these documents readily available upon request from the Judge or court staff.

Juveniles

The Municipal Court has jurisdiction over juveniles 16 years of age and younger at the time of the offense who are charged with a Class C misdemeanor.
for all proceedings in their cases.

Juveniles who fail to appear or resolve their cases will be reported to the
[**Department of Public Safety**
,](https://www.dps.texas.gov/)
which will deny renewal of their driver’s license. If they do not have a license, they will be unable to obtain one until they have satisfied all obligations to this court.

Requirements for Alcohol / Tobacco Related Offenses

All persons 17-21 years of age who have been charged with an alcohol- or tobacco-related offense
before the judge.
