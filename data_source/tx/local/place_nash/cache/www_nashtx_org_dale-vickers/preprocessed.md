Dale Vickers
------------

Council Member of Nash, Texas
-----------------------------

After retiring from a successful career in education as a teacher of German and as a principal at Texarkana Independent School District, Dale Vickers began a second career serving the people of the United Methodist Church. He took delight in his ministry as pastor for over ten years at Laws Chapel United Methodist Church, near Atlanta TX. In 2011, Dale was appointed as an associate pastor at Williams Memorial United Methodist Church. Part of Dale’s current ministry there is serving as chaplain at MRC Cornerstone.
Dale says, “The highlight of my week is the time I get to spend with my friends at Cornerstone. Laughing, talking, and praying with the residents brings me pure joy.”
A graduate of the University of Arkansas with a major in German, Dale is an avid Razorback sports fan, especially football, basketball, and, more recently, baseball. Dale’s education also includes a Master of Science degree and theology education.
Dale also serves on the Cornerstone Advisory Board, as an alderman for the City of Nash, TX, and as a member of ATCOG.
Being called Granddad by two super grand boys brings Dale a great deal of pleasure. He cherishes their visits both in his home in Nash and in their home in Northwest Arkansas.
