Andre' Byrd, Sr.
![CM Byrd](https://www.ci.desoto.tx.us/revize_photo_gallery/Photos/CM%20Byrd.jpg?t=202508261230020)
Elected on May 4, 2019 to fill an unexpired term, Andre’ Byrd is not only a force in DeSoto’s public life but is now also formulating “visions” for the next generation. Andre’ is committed to a few basic and driving principles: serve God, love family and be accountable to community.  He was re-elected to serve his second full term, in May 2023.
As the Founding Pastor of the New Covenant Christian Fellowship Church, the church has grown from a 3-member bible study to over 1200 current members.  With current assets of over 1.5 million dollars, under Andre’s leadership the church is known internationally for its commitment to the spread of the gospel and service to all people. His commitment to serving God extends from the local church body to leadership roles on the Pastoral Advisory Board of Baylor Scott & White and president of the Covenant House, a rehabilitative haven for men recovering from substance abuse.
As a husband and father, seeing the unlimited possibilities and natural beauty of DeSoto, Andre’, with his high school and college sweetheart Jacqueline, decided to make DeSoto the place to raise their two children; Andrea and Andre II, and have joyfully been residents for over 20 years.
Andre’s leadership style should be considered as a servant leader. Regardless of his title or position, his approach is always to serve those he encounters. This is evident in his role as the controller with Medco Construction a 136 million dollar company, his consulting clients the Omni Corporation, the Rosewood Corporation, and Noble House Corporation—all which attest to Andre’s hallmark of integrating and balancing visionary leadership with common sense, problem-solving, and solution-oriented collaborations.
Ever careful to select and accept roles that align and position him according to his deepest convictions, he has a civic resume that has provided opportunities to leverage visionary leadership for predictable and sustainable growth. Andre’s desire to serve is apparent in his participation on the Thorntree Homeowners’ Association (HOA); the Board of Directors for Leadership Southwest; and member of the Texas Municipal League. Within the City of DeSoto, his servant fiscally responsible leadership has been utilized as the council liaison for DeSoto Economic Development, member of the Adhoc Committee for DeSoto Women-and Minority-Owned Business Enterprises (W/MBE) and member of the DeSoto Audit and Finance Committee.
Andre’ enjoys traveling with his wife Jacqueline and has plans to see all of the world’s wonders. He considers himself a lifelong learner; he has attended Southern Bible Institute, Dallas Baptist University, holds an Honorary Doctorate Degree from Texas Bible Institute and Seminary and is a certified Faith-Based Counselor. .
