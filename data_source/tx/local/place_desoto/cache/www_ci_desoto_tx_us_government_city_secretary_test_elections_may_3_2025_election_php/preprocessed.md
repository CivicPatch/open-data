May 3, 2025 - General Election
==============================

We want to thank all who participated in the May 3, 2025 General Election. The results are in, and we are pleased to announce that Mayor Rachel L. Proctor has been re-elected and will continue serving as Mayor of DeSoto.

However, in the races for Councilmember Place 3 and Councilmember Place 5, no candidate received more than 50% of the vote. As a result, a runoff election will be held to determine the winners for both seats. The top two candidates in each race will advance to the runoff.

: Saturday, June 7, 2025

We encourage all eligible voters to participate in this important upcoming election that will help shape the future of our city. Stay tuned for additional information, including early voting dates/times for the runoff election.

May 3, 2025: All DeSoto vote centers have been accounted for. Final results will be posted once final mail in ballots have been received by Dallas County Elections.
