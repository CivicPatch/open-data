Council Member Catherine Lewis - Position 2
===========================================

After earning degrees in geology and geophysics at the University of Arizona and Stanford, I earned a Ph.D. from Colorado School of Mines. After thirty years in the oil and gas industry, I still love being a geologist.

An avid bicycle rider, I personally value the quiet streets and safe neighborhoods of Bellaire. My early interest in council activities began in the ’90s when I helped petition Bellaire neighbors to close streets at the Loop to keep children and pets safe from cut-through traffic.

In my 30+ years in Bellaire, I welcomed refugees and international students into my home, and I remain close friends with them today. They are part of the American dream now. I especially value the First Amendment of the Constitution that guarantees our freedom of speech, our free press, and our freedom of religion. I am an active member of First Presbyterian Church of Houston.
