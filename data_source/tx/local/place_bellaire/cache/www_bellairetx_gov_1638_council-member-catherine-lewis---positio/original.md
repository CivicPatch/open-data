Council Member Catherine Lewis - Position 2
===========================================

### Introduction

I started off as a starving artist in Tucson, with a BFA in studio arts. Going out in the desert led me to love the stars on dark nights and the mountains full of mysteries of ancient time in the rocks. That’s when I realized I was a scientist at heart.

### Professional Experience

After earning degrees in geology and geophysics at the University of Arizona and Stanford, I earned a Ph.D. from Colorado School of Mines. After thirty years in the oil and gas industry, I still love being a geologist.

### Personal Information

I retired to be the caregiver for my father and brother. I respect the burdens of caregivers, and admire the medical community for all their kindness and expertise in extending life and quality of life even to “the least of these.”

An avid bicycle rider, I personally value the quiet streets and safe neighborhoods of Bellaire. My early interest in council activities began in the ’90s when I helped petition Bellaire neighbors to close streets at the Loop to keep children and pets safe from cut-through traffic.

In my 30+ years in Bellaire, I welcomed refugees and international students into my home, and I remain close friends with them today. They are part of the American dream now. I especially value the First Amendment of the Constitution that guarantees our freedom of speech, our free press, and our freedom of religion. I am an active member of First Presbyterian Church of Houston.

### Current Term

January 8, 2024 - January 3, 2028
