Council Member Cindy Cohen Taylor - Position 4
==============================================

Cindy has been an active contributor to the welfare of Bellaire and its residents since 2021 when she joined the Parks and Recreation Board. In 2022, she was elevated to Vice Chair of the Parks Board and graduated from the Bellaire Citizen’s Academy.  She was recently selected to serve as a voting board member of the Patrons for Bellaire Parks and a City of Bellaire Ambassador.  A passionate advocate for accessibility and for protecting and enhancing our green spaces, Cindy led the successful effort to make the Officer Lucy Dog Park accessible and helped to secure City Council approval of a plan for improving accessibility of all Bellaire city parks. She recently served as chair of the Bellaire Planting Palooza and currently chairs the committee for the Bellaire Trolley Run.

A graduate of Robert E. Lee (now Wisdom) High School and Emerson College in Boston, Cindy enjoyed a successful career in radio sales, including 10 years as director of sales for eight Houston radio stations. Two generations of Bellaire and Houston parents (and children) know Cindy as the owner and COO of JumpBunch, a sports and fitness program for preschools and elementary schools.  For 19 years (2003-2022), Cindy and JumpBunch were mainstays in the educational landscape of our community.  Cindy now leverages her expertise as a consultant for Youth Athletes United (YAU) and small business owners launching their YAU franchises nationwide.

Cindy and her husband Matt (and their foxhound Frankie) live in Southdale and have two daughters who live and work in New York City.  In her free time, Cindy is an avid runner, mountain hiker, loyal “Swiftie,” and dog-lover.
