Council Member Jackie Georgiou - Position 6
===========================================

Jackie has been involved in the Bellaire Community for years. Whether it is a baseball game, parade, fun run, fundraising event, or council meeting, Jackie is there. She is a fierce believer in supporting the Bellaire Police and Fire Departments, as well as all the men and women who come to work each day to make sure the City of Bellaire continues to be a great place to live and work. Jackie welcomes small businesses and encourages purposeful progress / economic growth within the City of Bellaire.

Jackie went to Gordon Elementary (currently Bellaire High School baseball fields), Lanier Junior High, and Bellaire High School. Upon graduation she attended Texas A&M University where she received a Bachelors Degree in Accounting.   She is a Certified Public Accountant and has an MBA in Finance and International Business from the University of St. Thomas.  Jackie has spent her entire career in the energy sector. She is currently employed by Shell Oil as a Senior Director of Business Development.

Jackie Georgiou has always called the City of Bellaire “home.” Her family relocated to the area when she was 6 months old.  A fun fact about Jackie is that she, her husband, Mike, and their two children live in the same place she grew up. In 2002, they completed the construction of their current home on her childhood property.
