The City of Bellaire was incorporated in 1918 at which time it adopted a General Law form of government. The city's current form of government, Home Rule, was not adopted until April 2, 1949. The city operates under a Council-Manager form of government. The City Council is composed of a Mayor and 6 Council Members, all of whom are elected at large. The Mayor is elected for regular terms of 2 years, and the Council Members are elected for regular terms of 4 years, with the Mayor and 3 Council Members being elected at each regular election.
