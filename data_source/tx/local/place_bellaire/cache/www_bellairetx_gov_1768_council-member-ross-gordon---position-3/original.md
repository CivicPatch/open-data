Council Member Ross Gordon - Position 3
=======================================

### Introduction

Ross Gordon was elected to Bellaire City Council in November 2021. Prior to joining City Council, Ross served on Bellaire’s Planning and Zoning Commission from 2017 to 2021, including serving as Chair from 2018 to 2021. Over his tenure on the Planning and Zoning Commission, he focused on promoting transparency, encouraging public involvement and civil discussion, evaluating issues fairly and objectively, and employing a reasoned decision-making approach considering both appropriate neighborhood protections and the strategic needs of the community at large.

### Personal Information

Ross has lived in Bellaire since 2016 with his wife Amishi Shah, their young children, Kavi and Riya, and their puppy, Kaya. They are fortunate to live down the street from Amishi’s parents, who have lived in Bellaire for nearly 25 years.

After growing up in the Chicago area, Ross moved to Houston to attend Rice University and immediately fell in love with the city. After completing his bachelor’s degree in civil engineering and his master’s degree in environmental engineering, both from Rice, he has dedicated his career to solving the Houston region’s daunting flooding and infrastructure challenges.

Ross has a strong record of public service, having served on the Board of Directors of the Rice Engineering Alumni Association, as a Professional Mentor for the Rice University Engineers Without Borders, as a Lecturer in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Rice University, and as a member of the Greater Houston Partnership’s Infrastructure and Resiliency Advisory Committee. He currently serves as a Voting Member of the Sabine Regional Flood Planning Group, which is responsible for developing that region's first Regional Flood Plan and Texas' first State Flood Plan.

### Professional Experience

Ross is a licensed Professional Engineer and a Certified Floodplain Manager. He specializes in flood risk and floodplain management, urban and coastal resiliency, disaster response and recovery, capital improvement planning, program management, and alternative financing and project delivery.

Ross owns and manages a small engineering and strategy consulting company which helps public and private organizations develop strategies and solutions to address complex water resource and infrastructure challenges. Previously, he served as an Associate Vice President at a Fortune 500 engineering company in Houston, overseeing its water resources engineering practice in Texas and across the central United States.

### Current Term

January 3, 2022 - January 5, 2026
