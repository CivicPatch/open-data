#### Ballinger City Park

​

Ballinger has a 20-acre city park located on the banks of Elm Creek at 120 Crosson Ave. A full-time caretaker keeps the park clean and well-maintained.

Nestled in a beautiful setting with green grass and large pecan shade trees, the park is ideal for family reunions and social functions. It is located at the bottom of the hill from the Community Center, so both facilities can be easily utilized together for events.

City Park Board​

### History of the Ballinger City Park Board

The Ballinger City Park Board was established to provide oversight and long-term planning for the city’s parks. Its creation was largely driven by the development of the Imagination Station, a community-built playground that required ongoing maintenance, safety oversight, and future planning.

As a result, the Park Board was formed to help manage park improvements, support funding efforts, and ensure that projects like the Imagination Station continue to be maintained and enjoyed by the community.
