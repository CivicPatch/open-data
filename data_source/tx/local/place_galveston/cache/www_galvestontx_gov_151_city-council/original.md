What Is the City Council?
-------------------------

Like state and federal government, city government is organized to balance the legislative, executive, and judicial powers. [City Council](https://www.galvestontx.gov/Directory.aspx?did=41) is the legislative branch, which derives authority from a charter granted by the State of Texas; the [city manager](https://www.galvestontx.gov/153/City-Manager) is the chief executive officer; and the Municipal Courts judge the guilt or innocence of those accused of breaking city laws and determine punishment for those who are guilty.

Responsibilities
----------------

The City Council and the mayor establish policy through the adoption of ordinances. The six council positions are elected by district to two-year terms and the mayor is elected at large to a two-year term. Council positions are eligible to serve up to three two-year terms. The City Council appoints the city manager and five other positions: [city secretary](https://www.galvestontx.gov/262/City-Secretary), [city auditor](https://www.galvestontx.gov/261/City-Auditor), [city attorney](https://www.galvestontx.gov/256/City-Attorney), tax collector (currently outsourced to Galveston County), and Municipal Court judge.

The city manager is responsible for administering all city functions: employment of personnel; development, presentation, and administration of the city budget; and implementation of City Council's policies.
