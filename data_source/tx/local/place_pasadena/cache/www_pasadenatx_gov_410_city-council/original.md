Biography
---------

Carlos Heredia has built a successful career in civil engineering since 2003, contributing to a wide range of infrastructure and development projects across the region. An accomplished amateur boxer, he captured titles in the Copper Gloves, Silver Gloves, Golden Gloves, and the 1996 Junior Olympics. Although he excelled in the ring, Carlos chose to shift his focus toward his career and family life in Pasadena, Texas, where he is a devoted father to three boys and a daughter who proudly served in the U.S. National Guard.

In his professional career, Carlos has contributed to a variety of significant civil engineering projects, including the Gessner Sky Bridge and multiple utility initiatives across different jurisdictions. From 2022 to 2024, he served as Vice President of the Harris County NW Municipal Utility District, where he led impactful efforts such as reducing taxes, creating new sidewalks, and developing a park for the community.

In his leisure time, Carlos enjoys boating, golfing, and fishing, making the most of his time outdoors while nurturing his passion for family and community.
