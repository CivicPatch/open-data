**Mayor Responsibilities**

The Mayor presides at all meetings of the Council and is recognized as head of the City government for all ceremonial purposes and by the Governor of the State of Texas for purposes of military law.

**City Council Responsibilities**

The function of the City Council is to ratify orders, ordinances and resolutions, and the establishment of policy focus for the conduct of the affairs of the City of Alice. The Alice City Council is made up of five members. The Mayor and four council members are elected at large.

All powers of the City and the determination of all matters of policy are vested in the City Council. Except where in conflict with, and/or otherwise expressly provided by the charter, the City Council shall have all powers authorized to be exercised by the City Council by Texas statutes, and acts amendatory thereof and supplementary thereto, now or hereafter granted by any other laws of the State of Texas to the City Council. The Council elects a Mayor pro tem who acts as Mayor during the absence or disability of the Mayor.

City Council Meetings

The Alice City Council typically meets on the third Tuesday of each month at 2:00 pm. They are held in the City Council Chambers at City Hall at 500 E Main St.

Citizens are encouraged to attend City Council meetings as a way to actively participate in the process of government. If you have questions about the City Council meetings, please call (361) 668-7210.

At least three of the four Councilmembers must be present to constitute a quorum before the official business meeting is called to order. The Mayor, or in his absence, the Mayor Pro Tem, presides at each meeting.
