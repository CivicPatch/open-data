A Message From Mayor Chris Riley
================================

![Mayor Chris Riley](https://www.leonvalleytexas.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_node_primary/public/imageattachments/administration/page/2380/241273991_100146639122383_2648447097656609933_n.jpg?itok=b5ymewx_)

**From Mayor Chris Riley**

**January 23, 2026**

**16
Annual Town Hall meeting is CANCELLED for this Saturday, January 24
.**


This annual meeting
**is rescheduled to Saturday, February 7**


This action was taken to ensure the health, safety and welfare of our citizens during this upcoming winter advisory. Thank you for your understanding.

will conclude our town hall meeting to give citizens an opportunity to address council on any concerns/issues not listed on the agenda.  No action can be taken on citizen concerns other than giving facts/law pertaining to the item.  Council can direct staff to place items on a future agenda for discussion and/or action.

**CITY COUNCIL MEETING –January 20, 2026**

The following are highlights of council actions from the December 16, 2025 council meeting which began at 5:45 p.m. and ended at 9:43 p.m.

There are three residential developments in progress:  Senna I & II (7213 Huebner Road), Trilogy Grove (6300 Evers Road) and Seneca West (6518 & 6530 Samaritan).

– 380 homes are scheduled for development by DR Horton on 39 acres of land. Variances were given to reduce the lot size to 30 and 40 sf. No street variance was requested. Trees were clear cut (36 heritage trees removed) with the developer agreeing to plant 410 1.5 inch trees and pay a tree mitigation fee of $75,000 for Phase 1 & 2. The developer is still working on building the infrastructure.  10 home construction permits are being reviewed.

**City-Wide Diseased Tree Inventory**


– Council obtained through staff an inventory of the dead/diseased trees which could potentially cause harm to motorists and pedestrians.  38 locations from 13 neighborhoods were identified in our city. These diseased trees are listed either by address  within the public right of way (ROW) or on private property. The estimated costs to remove diseased trees in the public ROW is $34,500, and to remove trees on private property is $59,000. Council requested the specific locations of the dead/diseased trees.

In 2013 Bexar County bought the properties along Jeff Loop to expand Huebner Creek.  However, the road was never closed.  Closing the road and vacating the lots adjacent to the roadway will enable Bexar Appraisal District and the County Clerk to reconfigure the official maps to show current conditions. The Council agreed that declaring the street abandoned is in the public’s best interests.  The Council agreed to place this item on the February 3
Consent Agenda for final approval.

Dr. Caldera listed the steps to follow in addressing the following areas of violations:  Short Term Rentals, Graffiti, Dead Tree Ordinance, and Blocking the Sidewalk. For each of these violations, the manager discussed in broad terms initial enforcement, issuing citations, municipal court actions, including the Judge issuing a failure to comply and/or failure to pay. A final action that could be taken by the judge is to issue a warrant for arrest.  But city policy is to encourage compliance. Code enforcement takes time and money to give due process and follow the law.   No action was taken by Council other than to request this information be placed in a future Lions Roar.

**Discussion and Action on Amending Chapter 15 Zoning Planned Development District**


(PDD)– Before discussing the proposed changes submitted by council to amend the current PDD, the city manager opined that the suggested changes were restrictive which impacted “flexibility”, a key component of a PDD. With the reduction of undeveloped open space and the overhaul of the City’s Master Plan, the manager asked if a PDD was needed. It was suggested that the Council could keep the underlying zoning districts and deal with variances as they are requested. The consensus of the Council was to delete the PDD from Chapter 15 Zoning and to encourage participation by citizens, zoning commission and council in the upcoming Master Plan process.

**Council Passed a Resolution Ordering and Establishing Procedures for the General Election on May 2, 2026 -**


to elect three Council Members (Place 2,4 and Mayor), authorizing the Mayor to enter into a joint election agreement with


Bexar County Elections Administrator and the use of the Leon Valley Conference Center for early voting and election day voting. By the way, the deadline to register to vote in the May election is April 3, 2026.

City Council deliberated on the annual performance evaluation of Dr. Caldera, City Manager.  The council consensus was to continue this executive session at 5:30 pm on February 3, 2026.

The next City Council meeting is on
**Tuesday, February 3
at 5:30 pm.**
