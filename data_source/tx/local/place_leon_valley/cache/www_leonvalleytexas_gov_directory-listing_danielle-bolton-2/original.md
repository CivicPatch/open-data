Danielle Carriere Bolton

Danielle Bolton was born at Wilford Hall here in San Antonio.  Her family moved to Leon Valley in 1976. She was raised by a single mother and has three half-sisters. Danielle attended Leon Valley Elementary and was a member of the Grass Valley swim team through-out childhood.  She graduated from John Marshall High School in 1990.  While working full-time to assist her mother and pay for her tuition, she graduated with an associate degree from San Antonio College.  Danielle then transferred to the University of Texas at San Antonio and received her bachelor’s degree in early childhood education.  While teaching full time, she continued her education at UTSA and graduated with her master’s degree in educational leadership while carrying a 4.0 GPA.   Danielle has worked in the public-school system for the past 29 years teaching a variety of grade levels.  She has served as an assistant principal for the past 20 years, in addition to being a district hearing officer, truancy officer, special education supervisor, special education teacher.  She also developed and implemented a credit recovery campus for at-risk high school students. This campus was a great success and has enabled many students to complete their high school education instead of dropping out.  In conjunction with all the activities she does for students in the school system, she has been a volunteer for the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo Horse Show Committee for the past 20 years. 

Danielle and her husband of almost 29 years Philip, have two beautiful children who attend John Marshall and A & M.  As a result of her children’s interests in sports, and her own love of the outdoors, Danielle became a member of the park commission in June of 2018. 

Having lived in Leon Valley most of her life, Danielle is fully vested in doing what is right for our citizens (her neighbors).  She sincerely wants Leon Valley to be the safe, loving community that she was raised in.
