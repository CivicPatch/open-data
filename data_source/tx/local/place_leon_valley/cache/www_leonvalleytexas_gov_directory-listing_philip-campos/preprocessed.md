In 2004, Philip began his governmental career with the City of San Antonio where he served in the roles of a Contract Administrator and the Interim Contracting Director. In late 2008, Philip joined the San Antonio Water System as the Director of Contracting and over the last 14+ years, Philip has led the Contracting Department thru some very complex projects while always looking for opportunities to increase the levels of small business participation.

Philip has also held volunteer positions within the Leon Valley community such as the Planning and Zoning Commission, as well as the Citizens Police Advisory Committee.  In addition, he was a past president of the Marshall High School RAM Band Booster club and a volunteer for the Marshall Dance Team, as well as being a member of various other non-profit organizations within San Antonio.
