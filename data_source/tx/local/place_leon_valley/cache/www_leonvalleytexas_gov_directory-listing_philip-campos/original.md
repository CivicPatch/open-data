**Philip Campos**

**Leon Valley City Council Place 3**

Philip Campos, with his wife Anna moved to Leon Valley as newlyweds over 43+ years ago and has owned three different homes within the city (Sun Valley, Seneca Estates, and Castle Estates), where they started their family and raised their three children.  The primary reasons they stayed in this community was for the Fire, Police & EMS protection and the various other services the city offered.

Philip is a San Antonio native and was raised in the Woodlawn Lake area.  He graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in 1975 and is a 1979 graduate of Texas A&M University, with a BBA in accounting.

Philip started his career in the field of Internal Auditing, where he obtained the designation of Certified Information System Auditor and specialized in auditing computer facilities and computer system applications through the use of various audit software systems.

Philip has been a Certified Public Accountant for over 37 years and owned his own CPA practice for 18 years, with a staff of 10 employees.  He represented many clients throughout this region from Austin, San Antonio, and Del Rio that included clients from all aspects of business in the areas of accounting, consulting, and taxation. 

In 2004, Philip began his governmental career with the City of San Antonio where he served in the roles of a Contract Administrator and the Interim Contracting Director. In late 2008, Philip joined the San Antonio Water System as the Director of Contracting and over the last 14+ years, Philip has led the Contracting Department thru some very complex projects while always looking for opportunities to increase the levels of small business participation. 

As the SAWS Senior Director of Contracting, Philip oversees various areas within the organization such as the Contract Administration area; the Small, Minority, and Woman-owned Business (SMWB) Program; as well as the Construction Contract Payment Administration area.

Philip has also held volunteer positions within the Leon Valley community such as the Planning and Zoning Commission, as well as the Citizens Police Advisory Committee.  In addition, he was a past president of the Marshall High School RAM Band Booster club and a volunteer for the Marshall Dance Team, as well as being a member of various other non-profit organizations within San Antonio.

As a Leon Valley resident for the last 43 + years, Philip understands the needs of the community plus he brings the knowledge and expertise of the private business and the governmental sectors that is needed to serve the community of Leon Valley.
