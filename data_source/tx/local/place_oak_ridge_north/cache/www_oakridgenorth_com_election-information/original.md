Filers will find answers to most of their questions in the instruction guides to the forms.  

​

Method of Filing Application. [Sec. 1.007(c)] - <https://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/laws/candidacy.shtml>

Mail. An application filed by mail is considered filed at the time of its receipt by the appropriate authority.  The time of receipt is the time at which a post office employee:

Places it in the actual possession of the authority or an agent; or

Deposits it in the authority's mailbox or at the usual place of delivery for the authority's official mail.  [Sec. 1.009]

Filing in Person:  The Elections Division recommends that political subdivisions take steps to have someone available for at least a few hours most days during the candidate filing period to accept filings, and that political subdivisions post a schedule on their websites and on the bulletin boards where notices of meetings are posted of the days and times when someone will be available to accept filings. The Elections Division also strongly recommends having someone available at the place of business on the filing deadline, especially from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.

Filing by Fax or Email:  A signed, sworn, scanned candidate application (and petition, if applicable) may be submitted by fax or email if there is no filing fee. The filing authority must establish a dedicated email address for the submission of candidate applications.  This fax number or email address should be posted on the [Notice of Deadline to File Applications for Place on the Ballot (PDF)](https://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/forms/pol-sub/3-2af.pdf) or wherever information about filing candidate applications is posted, including your website notice.  Please be advised that an application must be notarized (or otherwise sworn to before someone authorized to administer an oath under Texas law) prior to filing via fax or email. 

NEW LAW:  House Bill 3107 (2021) amended Sections 1.007(c), 141.040, and 143.004 to codify this SOS advice.

NOTE: Employee Rule - an application filed by personal delivery is considered properly filed if filed with an employee of the authority at the authority's usual place for conducting official business. [Sec. 1.007]

Please contact City Secretary Elizabeth Harrell at [eharrell@oakridgenorth.com](mailto:eharrell@oakridgenorth.com) or at 832-381-3303 for additional guidance.
