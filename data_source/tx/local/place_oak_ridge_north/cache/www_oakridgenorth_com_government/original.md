Our Government
==============

The City of Oak Ridge North, Texas, is a Type A General-Law municipality. The City Council governs many city functions, including levying taxes, adopting ordinances and resolutions, considering assessments, and exercising budgetary and police control. Council members represent the city by responding to inquiries, suggestions, and complaints.

The City Council holds its regular meetings on the second and fourth Mondays of each month at 7:00 p.m. at City Hall. These meetings are open to the public, and community participation is encouraged.

From time to time, the Council may schedule special-called meetings, workshops, or public hearings to address specific issues or time-sensitive matters. Meeting dates or times may also be adjusted when necessary due to holidays or scheduling needs. All meeting notices— including agendas, special meetings, and any schedule changes — are posted in accordance with the Texas Open Meetings Act and made available on the City’s website and at City Hall.
