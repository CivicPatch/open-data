What is Code Enforcement?
Code Enforcement is responsible for the enforcement of City codes relating to bandit signs, abandoned and junked vehicles, substandard structures, weeds, brush, rubbish, and unsanitary matter. One of the main goals of Code Enforcement is to bring to the attention of residential and business owners any existing code violation which could have a negative impact on their community. Many such code violations are referred to as "public nuisances." Through voluntary compliance, cooperation, and a spirit of personal responsibility for the well-being of our community, conditions that create code violations can be eliminated and in turn, make the City of Oak Ridge North an even better place to live.

Ordinances Related to Code Enforcement can be found in
[Chapter 15 Code of Ordinances, Substandard Structures/Property Maintenance Code and](https://library.municode.com/tx/oak_ridge_north/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=COOR_CH15SUBUSTPRMACO)
[Chapter 34 Code of Ordinances, Environment.](http://library.municode.com/HTML/12832/level2/COOR_CH34EN.html)
