I am a lifelong Caldwell resident and a 1972 graduate of Caldwell High School. I married Janice Urbanosky in 1983, and we have two daughters and five grandsons. I retired in 2007 after a 33-year career in the oilfield, serving as a Sr. Production Foreman at Anadarko Petroleum. My role involved overseeing operations, budgets, and personnel.  I feel my leadership experience and innovative thinking from my professional background, only helps to support Caldwell’s growth and serve its residents effectively. I am always striving for progress and believe in the power of collaboration and open dialogue to address the needs and concerns of constituents.
