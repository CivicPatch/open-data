The most effective way for citizens to become involved directly in governmental programs is to serve on a board or committee. Community members who serve on Caldwell’s boards and committees provide an invaluable service by assisting the City Council and City Staff with developing recommendations on important policy matters. Participation on a City advisory body is an excellent way to get involved in the community and your local government. It is an interesting and challenging experience that can truly make a difference. If you are interested in serving, please submit an application so that you may be considered for future reference:
