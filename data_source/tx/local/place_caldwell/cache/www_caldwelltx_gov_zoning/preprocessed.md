Zoning Overview
Zoning is the regulatory system by which the City of Caldwell divides land into different districts (or zones) and establishes rules about how each area can be used—such as agricultural, large-lot residential, residential, mixed-residential, mixed-use, downtown core, general commercial, highway commercial, or industrial. Zoning helps ensure the city develops in an orderly, safe, and attractive way, promoting the public health, safety, and welfare.
Zoning regulations control aspects like:

1. Community Character: Zoning helps preserve Caldwell's unique character by aligning development with our city’s Comprehensive Plan

   .

You may occasionally receive a Public Notice regarding zoning—this is part of an important, legally required process designed to keep you informed and involved. When someone seeks a change—like a rezone request, a Conditional Use Permit, a variance, etc—the City must hold a public hearing. This hearing allows residents to learn about the proposal and offer feedback.

* We publish notice at least 16 days before the hearing in the Burleson County Tribune.
* The property owner posts notice on the property at least 11 days before the hearing.

Proper procedures ensure these hearings are fair, transparent, and informative. Public hearings are not just meetings—they are opportunities:

* Zoning shapes how our city grows—where homes, parks, stores, and businesses go.

Non-conforming Uses
These provisions balance protecting property rights for lawful uses existing before zoning took effect—while preventing old, incompatible uses from expanding or lingering indefinitely. The ultimate goal is gradual alignment of all properties with current zoning.

1. It is abandoned or left unused for 1 year.

If you're unsure whether your use qualifies, or if you're planning changes, you can request a determination or seek a Special Exception through the Board of Adjustment. Staff and legal counsel are available to guide you through options.
Although pre-existing legal uses can continue under the nonconforming status, certain events legally require properties to conform to the new zoning regulations:

1. A use is considered
   —and nonconforming rights are lost—if any occur:
   * The use stays vacant, or its equipment removed for 1 year;

You may occasionally receive a Nonconforming Use Letter when the City considers amendments to the zoning ordinance. This notice is required by Texas state law whenever a change—or new zoning regulation—might make your currently legal property use
.

1. Legal Compliance - According to Texas Local Government Code § 211.006(a‑1), the City must mail written notice to owners and occupants at least 10 days before any public hearing that could render a lawful, existing use “nonconforming” under a proposed zoning change.

* Submit comments via mail, email, or in person.
* Ask questions about your rights and how the changes may affect you.

A Nonconforming Use Letter is your legal notification that a zoning amendment could affect how you currently use your property. It's part of our commitment to keep you informed and involved—while protecting your existing rights. If you ever have questions after receiving one, our Development Services team is here to help.
Resilient Communities Program (RCP) Grant
In the Fall of 2022 the City of Caldwell City Council authorized staff to begin the RFP process to secure a Grant Administrator to prepare the city's application for the Resilient Community Grant Program project application for Caldwell, Texas. Council selected GrantWork's, Inc. to be the grant administrator for this project and began working with city staff in the spring of 2023 to prepare the application for the RCP grant. This grant application aimed to support local initiatives based on the 2022 Envision Caldwell Comprehensive Plan to enhance community resilience related to environmental, economic, and social challenges. The grant was awarded to the city in December 2023 and staff began working to draft the ordinances with GrantWork's, Inc. in 2024. The grant project was closed out and completed by summer of 2025. Specifically, the city's project scope is to:

1. Zoning Ordinance Creation (ORDINANCE ADOPTED APRIL 2025):
2. Amending Adopted Building Codes (ORDINANCE ADOPTED JANUARY 2025):
3. Amending the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance (ORDINANCE ADOPTED JANUARY 2025):

These initiatives align with the grant program's goals of fostering sustainable development and increasing the community's capacity to adapt to future challenges. The grant was a 90/10 grant meaning that 90% of the costs are funded by the State General Land Office (GLO) and the remaining 10% was funded by the City's adopted budget in FY2025.
