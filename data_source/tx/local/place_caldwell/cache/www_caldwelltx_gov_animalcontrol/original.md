[Code of Ordinances](javascript:;)[State Animal Welfare Laws](javascript:;)

The mission of the City of Caldwell Animal Control is to safeguard the well-being and harmony of both human and animal communities within our city. We are committed to providing compassionate, efficient, and effective animal control services that prioritize the protection, care, and welfare of all animals. Through responsible enforcement of animal welfare laws, proactive education programs, and responsive community engagement, we aim to promote responsible pet ownership, prevent animal cruelty, and mitigate public health and safety risks associated with animals. We strive to maintain a balance between the needs of the community and the rights and welfare of animals, ensuring a safe and compassionate environment for all residents and their beloved animal companions.

City of Caldwell Pet License

The City of Caldwell requires every dog and cat more than six (6) months of age that is kept, harbored, or maintained by the owner within the city limits to have a license. Dog and cat licenses are issued by the City upon payment of the fee ($20.00) and application that states the name and address of the owner or keeper of such dog or cat and the name, breed, color, and sex of the dog or cat being licensed. [(City of Caldwell Code of Ordinances § 2.02.001)](javascript:;)

* Dogs and cats must also be vaccinated for rabies\*

Failure to obtain a license will result in a fine of $50.00 on the first offense and $150.00 for each subsequent offense.

If you have any questions about obtaining a pet license/tag, please call the City of Caldwell Animal Control at [979-567-](javascript:;)4455 Monday through Friday, between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM.

Leash Laws

When a dog is being walked or with its owner off its property, the dog must be on a leash and always accompanied by the owner. If the dog is without a leash or not accompanied by the owner, it is considered unrestrained and is in violation of the [City of Caldwell Code of Ordinances § 2.01.011](javascript:;), which states:

“It shall be unlawful for any person raising, owning and/or keeping any animal to willfully suffer or permit any such creature to run at large upon the public streets, avenues, alleys, parks, or other public property of the city, or to willfully suffer or permit any animal to run at large or to go upon the premises owned or in possession of or under the control of any other person in the city.”

If you are experiencing problems with an off-leash dog, please call the City of Caldwell Animal Control at [979-567-](javascript:;)4455 Monday through Friday, between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM. To report an issue after hours, please call the Burleson County Sheriff's Department at [979-567-4343](javascript:;).
