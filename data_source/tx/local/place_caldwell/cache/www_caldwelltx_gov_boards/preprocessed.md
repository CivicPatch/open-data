The most impactful way for citizens to engage with governmental initiatives is by serving on a citizen board or committee. Citizen boards are not legislative bodies; their authority is determined by city ordinances and/or state statutes. Community members on Caldwell's boards and committees play a crucial role by aiding the City Council and City Staff in formulating recommendations on significant policy issues. Participating in a City advisory body is an excellent opportunity to immerse yourself in the community and local government. It offers an engaging and rewarding experience that can truly make a difference.

For more information about the City's boards and committees, please reach out to Amanda Frank at City Hall, located at 114 S. Echols Street, or call 979-567-3271.
