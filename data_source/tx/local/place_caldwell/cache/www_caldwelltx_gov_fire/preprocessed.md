The City utilizes a third-party contracted inspection company, Bureau Veritas, to inspect fire related projects. Fire and Life Safety Inspections related to building construction can be requested by contacting Bureau Veritas directly at any of the following:
Phone:    (817) 335-8111 or (Toll-Free) (877) 837-8775
Fax:        (817) 335-8110 or (Toll-Free) (877) 837-8859
Email:
[inspectionstx@us.bureauveritas.com](javascript:;)

* Project address
* Contractor’s name and contact information

Inspections received by Bureau Veritas by 4:00pm Monday-Friday (excluding Holidays) will be scheduled for the next business day following the request. Fire protection inspections usually take longer to schedule, so you should allow for three business days for those inspection requests to be coordinated.
