After you receive a City of Hallettsville citation you must respond to your charge(s) by the appearance date shown on the citation. When responding you have the option to enter a plea of Guilty, Not Guilty, or Nolo-Contendere (no contest). You may also be eligible for a driving safety course. Below is a letter furnished as a courtesy to you by the Hallettsville Municipal Court to assist you in disposing the charge(s) against you.

For a dismissal of a citation you may be eligible to attend a driving safety course only if you were issued a citation for a moving violation; if you were speeding, it must have been less than 25 miles over the speed limit; you have not attended a driving school in the past 12 months; you have a valid Texas Driver’s License; you have valid proof of financial responsibility; you present to the Court a written request to do so prior to your appearance date on your ticket. Failure to provide a written or oral request by your appearance date will result in forfeiture of that right. Contact the court immediately for additional information on the correct procedure.  The Driver’s Safety Course affidavit is included on the court handout
