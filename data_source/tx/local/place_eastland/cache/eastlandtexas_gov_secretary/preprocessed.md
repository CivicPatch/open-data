City Secretary

The City Secretary is one of the oldest public servant roles in local government. The position existed before Biblical times as "Keeper of the Archives".  Before the communication tool of writing, the Town Clerk was known as the "Remembrancer" because their memory served as the official public record .In present days, the City Secretary remains the "Keeper of the Archives" as the office documents and preserves the history of our city's government.
