The Board of Adjustment (BOA) was created by the Eastland City Commission to make decisions on appeals to the Zoning Ordinance of the City as it exists now or in the future by amendments. The BOA consists of five (5) members who reside or have a vested interest (Business, Home or Property) within the city limits of the City of Eastland. Board members are recommended by the Mayor to the City Commission for appointment. Members serve no more than three (3) consecutive terms of two (2) years. Three (3) alternate members may also be appointed by the Mayor and City Commission to serve in the absence of one or more regular members. Alternate members serve for two years. One alternate board member shall also be a member of the Planning and Zoning Board.

1. Permit the extension of a zoning district where the boundary line of a zoning district divides a lot or tract held in a single ownership at the time of the passage of the Zoning Ordinance.

1. Permit a variation in the yard requirements of any zoning district where there are unusual and practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the carrying out of those provisions due to an irregular shape of the lot, topographical or other conditions, provided such variation will not seriously affect any adjoining property or the general welfare.
2. Authorize upon appeal, whenever a property owner can show that a strict application of the terms of the Zoning Ordinance relating to the use, construction or alterations of buildings or structures or the use of land will impose upon him unusual and practical difficulties or particular hardship, such variations of the strict application of the terms of the Zoning Ordinance as are in harmony with its general purpose and intent, but only when the Board is satisfied that a granting of such variation will not merely serve as a convenience to the applicant, but will alleviate some demonstrable and unusual hardship or difficulty so great as to warrant a variation from the comprehensive plan as established by the Zoning Ordinance, and at the same time, the surrounding property will be properly protected. In considering all appeals and all proposed exceptions or variations to the Zoning Ordinance the Board shall, before making any exceptions or variations from the Zoning Ordinance in a specific case, first determine that it will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property or unreasonably increase the congestion in public streets, or increase the danger of fire or endanger the public health, safety, comfort, morals, or welfare of the inhabitants of the City of Eastland.
