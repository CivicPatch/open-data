an hour's drive to the Dallas/Fort worth Metroplex, the D/FW International Airport, and Fort Worth's Alliance (industrial) Airport.

Additionally, Eastland's integrated transportation and telecommunication networks provide convenient access to all US and Canadian markets as well as the consumer markets in Mexico and all points south.

EASTLAND CITY DEMOGRAPHICS

The City of Eastland is located in Eastland County in Central Texas, bordered on the east by Erath County, on the north by Stephens and Palo Pinto counties, on the west by callahan county, and on the south by Brown and Comanche counties The County was named for Capt.

Eastland County's current population base is estimated at 17,864.

LIFESTYLE

The resources that will be required for Eastland to continue its current quality of life well into the future are in abundance. Careful planning by city fathers has laid the foundation for sustainable, affordable development for many decades to

come.

We're fortunate that the resources both people and businesses need today and will require in the future don't have to be imported from other regions.

Eastland is a great place to raise a family, with a population base of almost 3,800 residents. A self contained town with medical amenities, sports for all ages, quality schools and competitive business environments all serve to make Eastland an complete place for a short stay or for a life-time.

Early fall kicks off the Eastland Little Dribblers leagues for both girls and boys and they play on Saturdays during the fall and early winter. Baseball and softball are not far behind and both leagues offer T-ball from ages 4 up to 18. Along with the local golf courses and lakes, there is a complete offering for the sporting enthusiast year round. If hunting and fishing are your hobbies, Eastland County offers many opportunities for wild game hunting. Additionally, fishing at Lake Leon is some of the best in the area.

From its quite historic neighborhoods to its thriving business center, forward thinking people are keeping Eastland on the cutting edge of growth... and yet planning it in such a way as to not lose its small town West-Texas flavor. The opportunities for jobs and business abound and the full service airport makes Eastland a quality town to live in and enjoy. It is only and hour and twenty minutes from the Dallas / Fort Worth Metroplex, and that is close enough.

EDUCATION

The Eastland school system works hard each and every year to offer a quality education to all of the students and does so without losing the hometown friendliness that one would associate with a small west Texas community.

**Eastland Independent School District - High School, Middle School, and Elementary 2022-2023 Enrollment:**

* Elementary: 505
* Middle School: 258
* High School: 311

Eastland Schools compete in the class 3A Division I of athletics and each year qualify most of their teams for post-district play and in addition, provide excellent opportunities in band, one act play, Vo-Ag and FCCLA competitions as well as high quality participation in all of the UIL academic contests offered each year for students to better themselves and improve on the already excellent educational opportunities featured on the exemplary campuses in the district.

Eastland County also offers an excellent 4-H program for year round emphasis on raising and showing animals.

EASTLAND EMPLOYMENT & WORK SECTOR

Eastland depends on the trade and services sectors. Eastland has a sizeable manufacturing and construction sector base which boosts local income levels.

The City of Eastland is committed to raising employment levels in the area, and has targeted "higher paying" job opportunities for it's citizens. Eastland has quality air and no traffic congestion.

Eastland has a large available employee base, supplemented by a multi-county drawing area. In addition, companies in Eastland have access to additional highly skilled workers located in the Dallas and Fort Worth Metroplex. Texas is a right-to-work state with only 7% of all workers unionized. Only three other states have fewer unionized workers than Texas.

TARGETED INDUSTRY SECTORS THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM EASTLAND'S LABOR POOL & RESOURCES

**Warehousing and Distribution**

Logistics and distribution centers are a viable target industry for Eastland. Recent articles by logistics industry experts have indicated that although dot-coms and the technology industry have taken a beating in recent years. the growth of e-commerce has spurred a heightened level of construction of state-of-the-art distribution properties. The nation's leading commercial and industrial real estate brokers report a steady demand for warehousing at all levels. U.S. industrial markets such as the West Central Texas region, which are under-tapped for these operations but offer strong transportation amenities, will be targeted by logistics companies looking to get closer to their consumers and save on their real estate costs.

**Plastics**

Plastics manufacturing is a viable target industry for the Eastland. The plastics industry is one of the largest manufacturing industries in the United States, accounting for more than $330 billion dollars in annual shipments. The industry directly employs more than 1.5 million workers. Plastics play an indispensable role in a wide variety of markets, ranging from packaging and building/ construction to transportation; consumer and institutional products; furniture and furnishings; electrical/electronic components; adhesives, inks, coatings, and other products.

**Regional Professional Service Centers and Call Centers**Customer Support and Service Centers consists of inbound call centers designed to provide read access to customer support for products and services. The functions at customer support and service centers are common to a diverse group of industries, and particularly to the retail, finance and insurance, manufacturing, transportation, software, utilities, and business sectors. They share the common element of being mid- to high-end, white-collar operations with well-educated employees. The workforce typically consists of individuals with two- or four-year college degrees and a high level of administrative or professional skills.  
  
**Administrative Service Centers**

Administrative Service Centers is a viable target industry for Eastland. As corporations continue to take steps to minimize their administrative costs, there is a growing emphasis on reducing headcount through the elimination of redundant positions, process improvements to make existing office procedures more efficient, and technology improvements to increase productivity. In order to implement these strategies, companies are turning increasingly to the relocation of single or multiple units that are the most cost sensitive and the most mobile from higher-cost locations to lower-cost centers such as Eastland

region

**Alternative/Wind Energy Production Equipment**

The wind product manufacturing industry target comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing turbines (NAICS 333611), which are the mechanical devices used to harness the energy from the wind. and turbine blades, which are one component of the wind turbine (NAICS 326199). While we focus on manufacturing the equipment involved in generating wind power, it is important to note that the West Texas region is also ideally suited for locating "wind farms" due to the flat terrain and abundant wind resources.

West Texas is already home to a number of windmill farms that can provide large amounts of electricity without the use of fossil fuels.
