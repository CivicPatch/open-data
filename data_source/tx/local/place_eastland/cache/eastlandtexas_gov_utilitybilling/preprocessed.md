The Utility Billing Department is your first contact when establishing a utility account for water, sewer and or garbage collection services with the City of Eastland.
The Texas Legislature recently passed HB 872 which includes legislation that makes government operated utility bills confidential. Customers used to have to specifically request to keep their utility bill private; however, the approval of HB 872 makes utility bills automatically private. Customers do have the option to opt out of having their utility bill kept confidential. For more information or to opt out please contact:
