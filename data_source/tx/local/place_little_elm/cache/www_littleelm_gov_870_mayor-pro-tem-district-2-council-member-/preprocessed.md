Mayor Pro Tem & District 2 Council Member Tony Singh
====================================================

Tony Singh was born in India and moved to the United States in 2003 to get his graduate degree in  Electrical Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington. While in school, Tony met his wife, Crystal.

Crystal and Tony have been Little Elm and District 2 residents since 2011. When looking for a place to call home, they looked in many cities and towns and finally decided to settle down in Little Elm, which had the unique charm of a small town but all the amenities of a big city. They are both animal lovers and have both cats and dogs that live in perfect harmony.

Tony graduated from the University of Texas at Arlington with an MBA and Master of Science in Electrical Engineering. He has worked in the telecom industry for the last 15 years in various engineering and management roles. He has always enjoyed explaining complex topics in simple terms and is currently working as a Technical Training Manager with SOLiD based in Plano, Texas.
