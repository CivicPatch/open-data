Mayor Pro Tem & District 2 Council Member Tony Singh
====================================================

Tony Singh was born in India and moved to the United States in 2003 to get his graduate degree in  Electrical Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington. While in school, Tony met his wife, Crystal.

Crystal and Tony have been Little Elm and District 2 residents since 2011. When looking for a place to call home, they looked in many cities and towns and finally decided to settle down in Little Elm, which had the unique charm of a small town but all the amenities of a big city. They are both animal lovers and have both cats and dogs that live in perfect harmony.

Tony graduated from the University of Texas at Arlington with an MBA and Master of Science in Electrical Engineering. He has worked in the telecom industry for the last 15 years in various engineering and management roles. He has always enjoyed explaining complex topics in simple terms and is currently working as a Technical Training Manager with SOLiD based in Plano, Texas.

He always believes in giving back to the community, as is evident by his continued volunteering efforts with the Little Elm Police Department, the Little Elm Fire Department, Citizens on Patrol, and the Make380Safe group, and he also served as a Commissioner on the Town of Little Elm Planning & Zoning Commission.

One of Tony’s main goals is to inform more residents of what is happening in their town and get more involved. Below is one of his favorite quotes that motivates him to continue volunteering and serving the community.

"Everybody can be great because everybody can serve. You don’t have to have a college degree to serve. You don’t have to make your subject and verb agree to serve…You only need a heart full of grace, a soul generated by love."

—Martin Luther King, Jr.

Tony looks forward to motivating more residents to join him in giving back to the Town of Little Elm.
