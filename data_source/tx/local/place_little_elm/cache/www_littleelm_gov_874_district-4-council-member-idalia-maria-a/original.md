District 4 Council Member Idalia Maria Amaya
============================================

Councilmember Idalia Maria Amaya was elected to the Little Elm Town Council in 2025. She is a dedicated public servant and proud native of Little Elm, with over 15 years of experience in social work, education, nonprofit leadership, and community development.

In addition to her role on the Town Council, Idalia serves on the Little Elm Community Development Corporation Board. She is also a graduate of Citizen’s Government Academy, a member of the Little Elm High School Alumni Association, and a volunteer with the Little Elm Area Food Bank.

When she’s not working, you can find her spending time with loved ones, enjoying live music, or exploring our Town’s beautiful parks. For Idalia, Little Elm isn’t just a place where she grew up—it’s home, and she’s proud to serve the community that shaped her.

A graduate of Little Elm High School and a longtime supporter of community development, Idalia is committed to helping Little Elm grow in a way that benefits all residents. She holds a Bachelor of Science in Human Development and Family Science from the University of Texas at Austin, and dual master’s degrees from Columbia University—in Social Work and International Affairs. In 2024, she graduated from the LBJ Women’s Campaign School at UT Austin.
