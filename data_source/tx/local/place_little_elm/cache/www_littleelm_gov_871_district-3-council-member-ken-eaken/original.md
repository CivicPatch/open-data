District 3 Council Member Ken Eaken
===================================

Prior to his election to the Town Council in May 2024, Ken has been actively engaged in the community, having been appointed by the Town Council to the Little Elm Economic Development Corporation Board of Directors in 2018 and serving as its President since 2020. He is a graduate of all the Towns Academies, Citizens, Police and Fire, volunteering in both Citizens on Patrol and Box 620 supporting the Fire Department.

Ken is also the Vice President of the Shell Beach HOA, living in Shell Beach since 2015 with his wife Jan and their two dogs…one adopted from the Little Elm Animal Shelter.

With his wife Jan he is her partner in their Real Estate Brokerage primarily serving Denton/Collin Counties.

Previously he was founder and President/CEO of two companies in GIS technology and has a diverse background in executive management from advertising, point of sale technology to air transportation operations. Ken has traveled the world and lived coast to coast.

He believes his background and experience will assist in the future direction of the Town of Little Elm and is grateful for this opportunity to continue his service to the community.
