Mayor's Welcome
===============

Welcome to the Town of Little Elm!

Little Elm is a place for singles, adults, and retirees. It offers residents affordable housing, world-class recreational amenities and activities, outstanding special events, and a thriving business community.

We're also the Town With a Lake Attitude, which means we love to relax, have fun, and unwind. We offer many ways to enjoy the lake and the outdoors, including the Little Elm Beach, parks, and an intricate trail system.

Still, if grabbing a cold beverage or sweet tea is more your speed, I encourage you to check out a patio in The Lakefront™ District, our destination district of recreation-based amenities and restaurants, or make a splash at our indoor waterpark, The Cove at The Lakefront®.

Little Elm is known for quality education and is home to three top school districts.

Little Elm is a great place to do business. Our Economic Development Corporation and Chamber of Commerce are committed to its development and to bringing a diverse array of businesses to the community to meet the needs of residents and visitors alike.

My administration and I are committed to serving you and all stakeholders at the highest level possible. To that end, my foremost focus is public safety to provide residents and visitors with a safe and welcoming environment.

We are committed to ensuring strong relationships with the community, region, and entities with a common interest.

We are dedicated to maximizing our community recreation and leisure activities to provide options for a broad range of socio-economic and interest groups. We focus on maximizing our unique shoreline opportunities on Lake Lewisville.

We will maintain operational integrity and viability, maintain high operational efficiency, and plan for long-term financial obligations.

We will maintain our distinctive look and high development standards to create a sense of place and promote and expand Little Elm's identity.

We will ensure excellence in public services while keeping up with the community's growth and maintaining high-quality services.

Little Elm is a growing and vibrant community and offers a quality of life that is second to none. I encourage you to experience that Lake Attitude for yourself and embrace it.

Once again, welcome to the Town of Little Elm.

Mayor Curtis J. Cornelious
