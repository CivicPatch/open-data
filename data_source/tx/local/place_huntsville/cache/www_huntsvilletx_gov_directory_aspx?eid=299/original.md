Russell Humphrey moved to Huntsville in 1977 to attend Sam Houston University, where he met his wife, Tish. Together, they have raised two children, Justin and Samantha. Both children are SHSU graduates, with Justin living in Houston and Samantha owns and operates a Huntsville business - Barbwire Barbie Boutique.    Humphrey also worked for Walker County Sheriff's Office for five years, as wells as the City of Huntsville for 10 years, while his wife worked for 20 years with the City. Humphrey believes that his family's involvement with the City from all sides help make him a good Councilmember.   

A few of Humphrey's goals include:

* To help insure the future of the community with controlled growth and procedures.
* To help the city thrive and prosper on both the sales tax and property tax revenues.
* To help see the bond issues through to completion.

When not working full time, Humphrey worships at Huntsville Church of Christ, is a Huntsville Leadership Institute (HLI) Class #24 graduate, and served on the HLI Board of directors.
