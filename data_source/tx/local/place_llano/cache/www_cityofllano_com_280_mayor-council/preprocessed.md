Appearing Before the Council

****City Council Workshops****

The purpose of a City Council workshop is to provide a forum for City Council and City staff members to discuss
and possibly take action on various subjects related to City operations, projects, and planning. Members of the
City's Commissions, Boards, and/or Committees may also be present to discuss various subjects with City
Council and City staff. Citizens are welcome to attend the Workshops; however, there will be no general
public comment opportunity at the Workshops, unless a specific public hearing is on the agenda. If citizens
have comments or questions for City Council or City staff, they may attend a Regular City Council meeting
and sign up to speak during the Public Comment section of the agenda. Citizens are also welcome to
communicate with City Council members and/or City staff outside of public meetings by contacting
City Hall at 325-247-4158.

****Regular City Council Meetings****

Although Texas Law does not provide for an opportunity for citizens to participate in local government meetings,
the City of Llano believes citizens have every right to participate in Regular City Council meetings, and we
encourage citizens to do so. Regular City Council meeting agendas have time set aside for Public Comment
near the beginning of the meeting, and there are additional public comment opportunities on the agenda if a
particular item requires a public hearing by law.

Citizens wishing to speak during a Regular City Council meeting must write their name and the agenda
topic they wish to speak about on the
[Public Comment](https://www.cityofllano.com/DocumentCenter/View/858 "Public Comment Form")
form PRIOR to 5:30 pm when the meeting begins.
The Request to Speak sign-in form will be available in the Council Chambers on the table by the entrance,
next to the agendas, prior to the meeting. If you do not sign up to speak prior to the start of the meeting,
you may not have an opportunity to speak. Citizens are not allowed to speak openly during the meeting
unless first recognized by the presiding officer. When the presiding officer calls their name, citizens
may speak for 3 minutes. If you would like to provide a presentation or speak longer than 3 minutes, please
contact the City Secretary's office at least two (2) business days prior to the start of the meeting to make
arrangements, by calling 325-247-4158.

Providing Written Comments/Documents to City Council
----------------------------------------------------

Citizens are also encouraged to provide written comments to the City Council regarding any agenda item
prior to the start of the meeting. Providing your comments in writing prior to the meeting may allow you
to be more thorough in your comments than time will allow at a City Council meeting, and will also allow
the Council Members time to study the comments before the meeting.  All written comments or other documents
you would like to provide to the Council Members should be emailed to the City Secretary Kim Wagner,
[kwagner
@cityofllano.com](https://www.cityofllano.com/280/kwagner@cityofllano.com)
, no later than 5:00 pm on the Thursday prior to the following Monday City Council
meeting, which is when agenda packets are delivered to Council Members
. If you wish to bring hard-copies
of documents to the meeting to be given to Council Members, you must bring 10 copies and provide them to the
City Secretary (not the Mayor or Council Members) prior to the start of the meeting. In accordance with the Open
Meetings Act, documents cannot be accepted by the Council Members directly. The City Secretary will ensure
the Mayor, City Manager, and the Council Members each receive a copy. If fewer than 10 copies are provided
to the City Secretary, the document may not be provided to Council Members until after the meeting when sufficient
copies can be made for each member.

If you wish to speak on an item that is on the agenda under the Public Hearing section, please wait to speak
until that item is addressed by City Council and you are recognized by the presiding officer. If you wish to speak
about an item on the agenda that is not in the Public Hearing section or on an item that is not on the agenda,
you will have an opportunity to do so during the Public Comment section when your name is called,
.

Please remember that during public comment, in accordance with the Texas Open Meetings Act, Council Members
are prohibited from answering questions (other than to make statements of fact or to recite existing policy), discussing
issues raised by citizens, or taking any action on any item that is not on the agenda for that meeting. Issues raised
may be referred to staff for research and possible future action.

Groups of citizens from the same organization or group are asked to consolidate their message and share 10 minutes
to address the Council on specific agenda items. The spokesperson for the organization or group should indicate
the organization or group name on the Request to Speak form and request ten minutes. Citizens cannot "donate"
their 3 minutes to another individual to allow that person to speak longer than 3 minutes.

1. Members of the public may address the City Council at the following times during a Regular meeting:

a) During the Public Comment section of the agenda after your name is called by the presiding officer (usually
the Mayor), if you have signed up to speak on the Public Comment form prior to the start of the meeting.
b) During the Public Hearing section of the agenda when the presiding officer opens the public hearing and
calls your name, if you have signed up to speak on the Public Comment form prior to the start of the meeting.
c) When the presiding officer invites you to speak.

2. Speakers must go to the podium and state their name and address for the record, prior to making their
comments. Please do not speak from your chair in the audience. Please speak clearly into the microphone so everyone
in the room can hear you.

3.
Speakers must address all comments to the presiding officer;

6.
Members of the audience are not allowed to speak out of turn or to interrupt the Mayor, Council Members,
staff, or other speakers when they are speaking. If you would like to comment, please sign up to speak and wait until
the presiding
officer calls your name and you will have an equal opportunity to be heard. We welcome and
encourage citizens to participate
during the Public Comment/Hearing section of the meeting; however, out of
respect for everyone in attendance, any disruptions
will result
in the offending party being removed from the
Council Chambers.

The City Council may go into Executive Session (closed meeting) to consider legal, personnel, security, and other
related matters permitted under the Texas Open Meetings Act laws.
The posted agenda will clearly identify matters which may be voted upon for final decision by the Council.
An agenda for a Regular or Special City Council meeting must, by state law, be posted at least 72 continuous hours
prior to the beginning of that particular meeting. The lone exception involves matters of an emergency nature, which
must be posted for at least 2 hours prior to the start of the meeting.
For the convenience of all citizens, copies of meeting agendas are posted on the bulletin board outside the main
door of City Hall and
on the City's website in the Agenda Center
. At City Council meetings, a copy of the agenda
will be available for citizens prior to the
start
of the meeting
.
Please remember to mute phones and other devices before entering the Council Chambers. If you need to have
a conversation with someone, please step outside in order to avoid disrupting the meeting or preventing others from
being able to hear the proceedings.
Please review the
"
Guidelines
"
for information on citizen participation at City Council meetings. There is a specific
time set aside for Public Comment during Regular City Council meetings, when citizens may address the
Council. If you wish to speak during a City Council meeting, you must sign up on the Request to Speak form
available at each meeting, PRIOR to the start of the meeting. In order to maintain order, and out of respect for
everyone in attendance, citizens are not allowed to speak openly (other than during Public Comment or Public
Hearings when recognized), to speak out of turn, or to interrupt the Mayor, Council Members, staff, or other
speakers during a City Council meeting unless called upon by the presiding officer - typically the Mayor. We
welcome and encourage citizens to attend and participate at City Council meetings; however, any disruptions will
result in the offending party being removed from the Council Chambers. If you sign up to speak prior to the start of
the meeting, you will have an equal opportunity to be heard.
If you have any questions about City Council meetings, please contact the City Secretary Kim Wagner,
