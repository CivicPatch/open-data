City Council
============

Nestled along the southeastern shore of Lake Lavon, the City of Lavon is a community of over 7,000 residents who enjoy the friendliness of a small town combined with the benefits of living near an exciting metro area. The City of Lavon’s growing parks and trail system, planned capital improvements, pursuit of quality retail and commercial businesses and commitment to service contribute to the outstanding quality of life our residents appreciate. Your friends at City Hall are eager to serve you!

The City of Lavon is a Home Rule Municipality with a Council-Manager form of government. The City Council (Mayor and City Council) is responsible for setting priorities that affect the quality of living and character of the City by passing laws (ordinances) and resolutions. They set the tax rate and create a budget to effectively operate and maintain the City in an efficient and professional manner. The City Manager’s office is responsible for the day to day operations of the City. As custodian of the City’s records, the City Secretary’s office provides notice of and records the proceedings of the City Council, Planning and Zoning Commission and other boards and commissions.

The Mayor, City Council and staff are committed to making your city government open, available and accessible to you. If we can be of assistance, please contact us. Your comments, suggestions, and input are always welcome. The City of Lavon employs a professional and friendly staff dedicated to working for you.

The City Council meets in the Council Chambers at City Hall (120 School Rd.), on the 1st and 3rd Tuesday of each month, at 6:30 pm. Special meetings may be called from time to time, so please watch the website for notices of them.
