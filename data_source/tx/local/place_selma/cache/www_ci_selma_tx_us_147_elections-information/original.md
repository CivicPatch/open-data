Elections Information
=====================

Welcome to the City of Selma Elections page. The information provided below is to guide potential candidates and registered voters through the election process.  
 

City of Selma General Elections are held annually on the first Saturday in May and are conducted and publicized in accordance with the [Texas Election Code](http://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/).  Election forms are available on the Secretary of State website and the Texas Ethics Commission website; however, the full Candidate packet is obtained from the City Secretary. Candidate packets, which include the application, are available in the City Secretary's office the first week of January.  Please click on a subpage link for details about the next or past election(s). 

**City Secretary's Role**

The City Secretary is responsible for conducting the City of Selma's municipal elections.  The City of Selma contracts with the Guadalupe County Elections Administrator to conduct and oversee its elections; however, the authority with whom required election documents are filed, and required notices are posted, remains with the City Secretary.  The City Secretary is responsible for providing applications, forms, notices of deadlines, and other election-related documents.  All documents received by the City Secretary are considered open records and will be viewed as such by reporters and opponents alike.  The City Secretary preserves all documents in accordance with the State of Texas Library and Archive Commission Retention Schedule.    
 

The City Secretary's Office serves as your filing authority and must maintain neutrality in the electoral process.  It is the duty of the candidate to become familiar with the laws applicable to campaigns for office.  Please call the Texas Ethics Commission at (512) 463-5800 or visit their [website](http://www.ethics.state.tx.us/) for any questions regarding reporting procedures, contributions, or expenditures.  Should you have any questions about election law, please call the Texas Secretary of State at 800-252-8683 or 512-463-5650, or visit their [website](https://www.sos.state.tx.us/).
