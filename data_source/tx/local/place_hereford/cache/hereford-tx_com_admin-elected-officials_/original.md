####

The Administrative Department consists of members of the City Commission, the City Manager, Assistant City Manager, City Secretary, and Receptionist. The City Commission is responsible for policy, leadership, and the general direction of the City Government. The Mayor and two Commissioners are elected at-large from the City, and four Commissioners are elected from specific places or wards within the City.

The City Manager has no set term of office but serves at the will of the governing body. The Commission is responsible for setting policy, and the City Manager is the Chief Executive Officer and the head of the administrative branch of the City government under the charter of the City of Hereford.

The responsibility of this department includes budget preparation and execution, as well as overall administration of City Ordinances and policy as adopted by the City Commission. The City Secretary’s duties include personnel/payroll, records management, municipal elections, public information official, and event planner.
