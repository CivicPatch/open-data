![About Us](https://hereford-tx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/118837380_597190704289259_6172987291842176424_n.png)

About Us
--------

Hereford is located at the crossroads of U. S. Highway 385 and U. S. Highway 60 with trans-continental rail access readily available. The 2010 Census reported the Hereford population to be 15,370. It is centrally located between the Texas cities of Amarillo, Canyon, Vega, Dimmitt, and Friona.

Hereford is a great place to live, work, do business, shop, and raise a family. The City of Hereford was named after the Hereford Cattle brought over from Hereford, England, in the 1890s and is now called the "Beef Capital of the World." Cattle feeding began to flourish in the 1960s and has continued to grow. In the late 1980's, the County led the state and oftentimes the nation in this category. Hereford also has a rapidly growing dairy industry.

Currently, the City of Hereford is experiencing moderate but steady growth in its business environment. The expanding dairy operations and ancillary businesses, along with other expansions in agribusiness, continue to contribute to our economy. Our retail sector is showing positive growth and is expected to continue.

If you are looking for a place to raise a family, Hereford has some great childcare facilities for working moms and dads, several primary/intermediate schools, a junior high, and a high school. There are also private schools. Amarillo College and West Texas A & M are both within driving distance. Amarillo College opened a branch campus in Hereford. There are many churches located in or near Hereford of various denominations.  We have an excellent hospital, clinics, and highly qualified doctors available to take care of any medical needs. There are also several financial institutions.

As the sign says, when you enter our city, "Stop, Shop, and Play" in Hereford.
