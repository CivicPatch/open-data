The Wastewater Department is responsible for the treatment of wastewater and includes maintenance of the wastewater treatment plant and 6 lift stations. The City of Hereford uses an activated sludge process plant with extended aeration mode. The main lift station has three 100 hp pumps that push the daily average flow of 1.2 mgd to the City Farm. At the farm, there are two aerated lagoons in a series with one storage pond.

Lagoons have a total capacity of 160 MG of treated effluent water prior to irrigation. Our goal is to remove all contaminants from the water before returning it to the environment.
