Is your reason to speak before the Council related to a charge against a City employee for improper conduct or misconduct?

For all other items that are not on the agenda citizens must file a citizen's communication by registering to do so on a form provided by the City Clerk and will be allowed five (5) minutes to speak; said request must be received by the City Clerk no later than 5:00 p.m. the Thursday prior to the Council agenda’s posting. NOTE: A citizen’s communication will not be schedule to speak before the Council, until such time as the applicant has made all attempts to resolve their issue or concerns through City staff and their respective Council Members. Also, Citizen Communications are for information gathering and no action may be taken on by the Council.

* A speaker must be recognized by the presiding officer in order to speak before the Council. When recognized, the speaker must step to the podium stating his/her name, address and organization (if relevant) for purposes of the record.
* All comments and questions must be directed to the Council as a whole and not to any specific member.
* No questions will be asked of City staff without the permission of the presiding officer.
* Charges against employees are not acceptable as a citizen communication and will be ruled out of order immediately and will be referred to take their complaints to the City Manager.
* No electronic media is allowed for presentations during a Citizen Communication. Information being presented to Council should be in paper format and twelve (12) copies should be provided to the City Clerk for distribution to Council and staff. Speakers may also use the overhead camera to display copies on the Council screens. For assistance with this item, please see the City Clerk’s staff.
* Once a speaker has completed his/her comments and takes a seat, any remaining time on the clock is forfeited, and he/she may not return to the podium.

* The City Clerk will operate the time clock at the direction of the presiding officer.
* The time clock will give notice of the expiration of time with three consecutive rings; at this time the speaker should end all comments and return to his/her seat.
