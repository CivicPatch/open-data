From the Office of the City Manager:  
  
We have heard your complaints.  
  
The three main thoroughfares in Abernathy belong to TXDOT. It is unknown why they did not prepare or clear the service roads, Avenue D, or First Street.  
  
The City’s main priorities are as follows:  
\* Water to residential homes and businesses  
\* Wastewater removal from residential homes and businesses  
\* Emergency Services being provided
