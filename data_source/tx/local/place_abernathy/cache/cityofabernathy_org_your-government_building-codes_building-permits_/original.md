 [Building Codes](https://cityofabernathy.org/your-government/building-codes/)Building Permits

Building Permits
================

Permit application must be submitted via our permitting software: **CLOUD PERMIT** at ***cloudpermit.com/gov/login.*** To submit your application, create a profile, submit your plans and licensing information. Once completed an invoice will be generated. You must bring payment and invoice to City Hall to receive your building permit and building permit placard.

For building permits within a “Special Flood Hazard Area” on a flood map issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), you **MUST** obtain a Floodplain Development Permit from the City before a Building Permit is issued (see [Floodplain Development requirements](https://cityofabernathy.org/your-government/building-codes/building-permits/#floodplains "Floodplain Development requirements") below). Abernathy [Zoning Ordinance 310](https://cityofabernathy.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ordinance-310.pdf "Abernathy Ordinance 310 - Zoning Ordinance") has certain setback requirements for every type of construction. The permit application may be denied if the proposed construction is outside of the designated setback area. **For questions regarding Permit Requirements, Flood Hazard Areas, or Zoning Setbacks, please contact City Hall.**

Building Permit Requirements
----------------------------

You are required to have a [building permit](https://cityofabernathy.org/your-government/building-codes/building-permits/#permits "building permit") if you are constructing, erecting, or moving in:

* Any residential or commercial building.
* A carport, pergola, gazebo, or deck.
* Any accessory (storage or shop) building larger than 200 square feet.
* Any addition or alteration to an existing residential or commercial building.
* A swimming pool.

Before the City of Abernathy can issue a building permit, you must submit a Building Permit Application. A plan review will be conducted by the City Inspector. All applications for building permits must include the following:

* One complete set of plans and specifications
* Foundation detail[\*](https://cityofabernathy.org/your-government/building-codes/building-permits/#foundationDetail "learn more about foundation detail requirements")
* Plat showing property lines, existing buildings, and proposed new construction
* Texas Architectural Barriers Act / EABPRJ# (for commercial projects valued over $50,000)

#### Foundation Detail

A foundation detail is required for all types of construction listed above, however, a complete set of plans and specifications may not be required by the Building Inspector for certain types of construction.

A [Backflow Assembly Test Report](https://cityofabernathy.org/your-government/building-codes/building-permits/#permits "Backflow Assembly Test Report") is required for all new irrigation systems. This must be conducted by a licensed TCEQ Backflow Tester. Periodic testing is required.

#### Expiration of Permits

***Permits expire if work has not started within 180 days, or if the work has stopped for 180 days. The permit may be extended one (1) time, if requested in writing prior to expiration.***

Floodplain Development
----------------------

The [National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)](https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance "National Flood Insurance Program - FEMA.gov") provides flood insurance to individuals at much lower premiums than could otherwise be purchased through private insurers and makes certain federal monies available to local communities. In order for citizens to be eligible for the national flood insurance rates, or for communities to receive certain kinds of federal monies, ***the community must agree to meet minimum floodplain standards***.

The City of Abernathy has adopted a [Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance](https://ecode360.com/40131089) (found in Article 3.05 of the [Abernathy Code of Ordinances](https://cityofabernathy.org/your-government/code-of-ordinances/ "Code of Ordinances")).

If the property which you proposed to develop is located within a “Special Flood Hazard Area” on a flood map issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), you **MUST** obtain a Floodplain Development Permit prior to beginning the project. There are penalties for failing to do so. To see if your property is located within a Special Flood Hazard Area, search the [FEMA Flood Map Service Center](https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home "FEMA Flood Map Service Center (MSC)") and follow the instructions on that page. At this time, FEMA has designated all Special Flood Hazard Areas in the City as “Zone A” – without base flood elevations.

**NOTE:** the issuance of a Floodplain Development Permit does not automatically exempt you from having to purchase flood insurance. You may buy flood insurance for your peace of mind, **you may be required to buy it before a lending institution will make or refinance a loan**, or you may not buy flood insurance at all.

#### Required Submissions

Required submissions may include:

* Floodplain Development Permit Application
* Three (3) complete sets of plans, sealed by a Texas-registered engineer, architect, or land surveyor
* Elevation Certificate
* Floodproofing Certificate
* No-Rise/No-Impact Certificate
