The City Council serves as the legislative and governing body for the City of Cedar Park and refers to these core values for guidance in their decision-making. The Mayor and six Council Members are elected to their respective offices by the qualified voters of the city. All positions are elected at large, meaning no council member represents a specific area or district of the city. Each member serves a two-year term. The Mayor is the official head of the city government for all ceremonial duties and serves as the chairperson of all council meetings. The Mayor Pro Tem is appointed by the Mayor and serves during the absence of the Mayor.

The Cedar Park City Council is listening to you and values your input. Please contact us and let us know how we are doing.
You may
[email the City Council](mailto:council@cedarparktexas.gov)

Residents are always welcome to join us for City Council and other City Public Meetings. If you would prefer to watch any of these meetings live from your home or on your personal device, please use our government access cable channel CPTV-10 in one of the following ways:

Thank you for your interest in the City Council. When our City Council envisioned our City's core values of community, service, innovation, professionalism, integrity, leadership, and fiscal responsibility, it was not a difficult task. After all, these standards are at the heart of daily life for Cedar Park citizens, City leaders, City staff, and business leaders.
