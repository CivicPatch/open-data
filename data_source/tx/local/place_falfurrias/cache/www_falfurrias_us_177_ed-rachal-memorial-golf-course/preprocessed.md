Ed Rachal Memorial Golf Course
==============================

![Ed Rachal Memorial Golf Course](https://www.falfurrias.us/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=121)
The present-day golf course is situated on part of the properties owned by Mr. Ed Rachal.

The foundation created by Mr. Ed Rachal granted the property to the City of Falfurrias, which subsequently turned over the operation of the golf course to the present non-profit organization. Falfurrias Golfers, Inc. membership has changed over the years, but the quality of the membership has remained the same.

The golf course is mainly used for recreation by the citizens of the city of Falfurrias, Premont, Hebbronville, Alice, Riviera, and Kingsville. The course gets an added boost in the winter months from our winter Texans that visit us from October through February/March from all parts of the country and Canada (estimates show over 1000 different golfers of both genders and varying from 15 to 90 years of age). These folks leave much-needed sales tax funds in Falfurrias and the surrounding areas.
