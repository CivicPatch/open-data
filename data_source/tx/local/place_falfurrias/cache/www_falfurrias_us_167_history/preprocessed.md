A Brief History of our City
---------------------------

Falfurrias, the county seat and principal trading center of Brooks County, is on State Highway 281, sixty miles southwest of Corpus Christi and ninety miles from Laredo in the northern part of the county. Its founding and development were largely the effort of Edward C. Lasater, a pioneer Rio Grande Valley rancher and land developer. The name Falfurrias antedates Anglo association with the area, and its derivation is uncertain. Lasater claimed that it was a Lipan Indian word meaning "the land of Heart's Delight"; others believed it was the Spanish name for a native desert flower known as the heart's delight. According to local tradition, the shepherd's land came to be known as La Mota de Don Falfurrias (la mota meaning "a grove of trees"), which eventually evolved into La Mota de Don Falfurrias and was finally shortened to Falfurrias.

### Falfurrias Ranch Founded - 1895

Lasater, pioneer Rio Grande valley rancher and land developer, started a cattle ranch in what was then northern Starr County; his spread came to be known as Falfurrias Ranch, after La Mota de Falfurrias, the grove of trees he chose as the site of his headquarters.

### City of Falfurrias Founded - 1904

To increase settlement in the area, Lasater encouraged the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway to extend a line to his ranch. At the railway terminus four miles east of his ranch house, he founded Falfurrias; he also changed the name of his ranch to La Mota. His Falfurrias Immigration Company set about attracting settlers by offering subdivided ranch land near the railroad at low prices and advertising extensively in the East and Midwest.
