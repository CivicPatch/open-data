Mayor Dan Davis: A Visionary Leader Committed to Manvel’s Future
----------------------------------------------------------------

I am a dedicated public servant, a trusted leader, and an innovative thinker committed to making Manvel a better place for every resident. As a devoted husband and father of two, I have deep roots in the community—living just down the street from my parents and working every day to ensure Manvel thrives for future generations.

Elected as the youngest City Councilmember in Manvel’s history (2019-2022), I quickly built a reputation for challenging the status quo, cutting through bureaucracy, and putting people before politics. In 2023, I was elected Mayor with 64% of the vote, becoming one of the youngest mayors in America. My leadership is centered on transparency, trust, and bold decision-making that moves the city forward.

My passion for service extends far beyond politics. Before entering public office, my wife, Erica, and I served as missionaries in Japan—an experience that reinforced my belief in the power of relationships, understanding different perspectives, and leading with humility.

As Mayor, I have championed policies that empower residents and businesses alike.  
Under my leadership, Manvel has:  
✅ Renegotiated development agreements to prioritize the needs of the community.  
✅ Cut burdensome regulations that stifled economic growth and investment.  
✅ Secured Manvel’s first grocery store—HEB, improving local access to essential goods.  
✅ Reduced unnecessary costs for residents, including establishing the first-ever Homestead Exemption.  
✅ Rewrote city policies, strengthening fiscal responsibility, preparing for the future, and putting people first.

Most importantly, I have focused on molding Manvel into a government that truly serves the people—restoring trust, encouraging open dialogue, and ensuring that every decision reflects the values of the residents I represent.

Beyond my official duties, I am deeply engaged in the community. Whether volunteering with local organizations, mentoring students, or working alongside neighbors, I believe leadership is about action, not just words. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, training for marathons, and indulging in my love for cookie dough.

I am not just leading Manvel—I am building a legacy of trust, innovation, and progress. My mission is clear: a government that listens, a city that thrives, and a future that works for everyone.
