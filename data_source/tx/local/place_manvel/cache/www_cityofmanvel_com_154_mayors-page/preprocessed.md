Mayor Dan Davis: A Visionary Leader Committed to Manvel’s Future
----------------------------------------------------------------

Elected as the youngest City Councilmember in Manvel’s history (2019-2022), I quickly built a reputation for challenging the status quo, cutting through bureaucracy, and putting people before politics. In 2023, I was elected Mayor with 64% of the vote, becoming one of the youngest mayors in America. My leadership is centered on transparency, trust, and bold decision-making that moves the city forward.

As Mayor, I have championed policies that empower residents and businesses alike.
Under my leadership, Manvel has:
✅ Renegotiated development agreements to prioritize the needs of the community.
✅ Cut burdensome regulations that stifled economic growth and investment.
✅ Secured Manvel’s first grocery store—HEB, improving local access to essential goods.
✅ Reduced unnecessary costs for residents, including establishing the first-ever Homestead Exemption.
✅ Rewrote city policies, strengthening fiscal responsibility, preparing for the future, and putting people first.

I am not just leading Manvel—I am building a legacy of trust, innovation, and progress. My mission is clear: a government that listens, a city that thrives, and a future that works for everyone.
