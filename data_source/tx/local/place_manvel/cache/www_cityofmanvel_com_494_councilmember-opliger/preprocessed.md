About Councilmember Opliger
---------------------------

-Dr Martin Luther King Jr

“What are you doing for others?” Dr. King famously asked. I carry this powerful question with me.  As your city council representative, I want you to know that I am here for you.

I have lived in Manvel for 23 years and have watched our community grow from a rural setting to what we see today. While it is exciting to see all that is new, this progress naturally brings change which, sometimes, brings problems. Whether you are new to Manvel or have lived here a long time, do not hesitate to reach out to me for help.
