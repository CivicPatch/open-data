City Council Meeting Speaker Protocol (Citizen Participation)
-------------------------------------------------------------

In support of and respect for an open, fair and informed decision-making process, the Mayor, City Council and Administration recognize that civil, respectful and courteous discourse and behavior are conducive to the democratic and harmonious airing of concerns and decision making; and uncivil discourse and/or discourteous and inappropriate behavior have a negative impact on the character and productivity of the decision making process.

State law prohibits the Mayor and members of the Council from commenting on any statement or engaging in dialogue without an appropriate agenda item being posted in accordance with the [Texas Open Meetings Law](https://).  Engaging in verbal attacks or comments intended to insult, abuse, malign, or slander any individual shall be cause for termination of speaking privileges and expulsion from the Council Chambers.

The Mayor serves as the presiding officer of the Council, the Mayor Pro Tem serves in the Mayor's absence.  
 **In order for the City Council to properly consider each matter brought to them, speakers must observe the following;**  

* Anyone attending a meeting in person wishing to speak before the Council must complete a [speaker participation form](https://www.cityofmanvel.com/DocumentCenter/View/931/MANVEL-CITIZEN-PARTICIPATION-REGISTRATION-FORM) and give it to the City Secretary prior to the meeting start time. (Forms will also be available at the meeting to fill out)
* Anyone speaking before the Council is asked, when their name is called, to stand at the speaker podium and first state his/her name and address for the record.  Only one person may speak at any one time and only the person who has been called by the presiding officer will be allowed to speak.
* Speakers must address their comments to the presiding officer rather than individual Council Members, City staff, or the audience.
* In an effort to accommodate all who wish to address the Council at a council meeting while preserving a reasonable and efficient meeting schedule, each speaker will have a 3 minutes to deliver comments.  Speakers are expected to cease comments immediately upon end-time.
* A person wishing to address the Council concerning a Public Hearing, must limit his/her remarks to the Public Hearing portion of the agenda.

Agendas are available prior to the meetings. [View Most Recent Agendas](https://www.cityofmanvel.com/129/Board-Agendas-Minutes).
