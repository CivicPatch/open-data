Tim Varlack originally hails from Brooklyn, New York, but has lived in and around the south Houston metro area for the last 33 years. He has been blessed to call our beautiful city home as a resident of the Sterling Lakes community since 2015.

Tim was honored to serve his country during the Gulf War as a member of the United States Army and later as part of the Texas National Guard.d "I take great pride in having served on both sides of the cycle, as a technician and then as an aviator."

Upon leaving active duty, he began a career in Supply Chain Management, where he has held positions of increasing responsibility in procurement for both the commercial and government sectors over the last 27 years. He has specialized in Capital Procurement for major projects across the globe. He drafted the Supplier Diversity Strategy and serves as a member of the Small and Diversity Business Council, among others.

Tim has previously served on the City Charter, Districting and Planning, and Zoning Committees. As a minister and member of Silverlake Church over the last 19 years, he, Carla his wife of 25 years, and only Son Tymmon, have served the community with the understanding that" we are all a part of a whole and that it is only when we are willing to see an issue from every side, from perspectives that are specifically NOT just our own, that then and only then, can we make decisions that are truly fair and productive for all."
