![Mayor Hairston](https://www.lancaster-tx.com/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=17554)

As your Mayor, it is my honor and pleasure to extend a warm welcome to the City of Lancaster, also known as the Shining Star of Texas. Lancaster is a vibrant and growing community where residents enjoy the quaintness of friendly neighborhoods that is only a few minutes from world-class entertainment and activities in Downtown Dallas. The City provides great job opportunities, an award-winning school district, as well as top quality award-winning parks and recreational facilities. We continue to ensure prosperity for all who call Lancaster home.

Our vision is to build a united community by exemplifying exceptionalism in the region. I look forward to seeing and greeting you as I am out and about in our community, both fellow residents and visitors alike.   Please call my office if I may be of assistance to you in making our great city, even greater.

Clyde C. Hairston, Mayor
