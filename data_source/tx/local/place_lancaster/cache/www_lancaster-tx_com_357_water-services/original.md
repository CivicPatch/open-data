Water Services
==============

New Water Service Connections
-----------------------------

To request new or transfer service, you must come to the Utility Billing office located inside of the Municipal Center at 211 N. Henry Street. You will need to bring the following information:

* Proof of property ownership or a signed copy of your lease agreement
* a valid Texas driver's license or valid state issued identification; commercial accounts require a valid Texas Tax I.D. number.
* Completed [Commercial Water Application](https://www.lancaster-tx.com/DocumentCenter/View/18004/COMMERCIAL-APP-2016 "Commercial Water Application") or [Residential Water Application](https://www.lancaster-tx.com/DocumentView.aspx?DID=270 "Residential Water Application")
* Signed [Water Service Agreement](https://www.lancaster-tx.com/DocumentView.aspx?DID=265 "Water Service Agreement") and [Confidentiality Agreement](https://www.lancaster-tx.com/DocumentCenter/View/16314/2021-Disclosure-Request-Form "confidentiality Agreement")

**If you are renting your home,** a Rental Inspection must be performed and approved by the City of Lancaster, Development Services Department prior to transferring services. For more information, please contact 972-218-1200.

Residential water deposits are $110 if you own the home and $170 if you lease the home. Commercial water deposits are based on meter size. Fire hydrant meters are $2800. All deposits must be paid at the start of new service.  
  
Any outstanding balance(s) from a prior account must be paid before establishing new service.

Disconnection of Meter for Final Bill
-------------------------------------

To disconnect your water service, customers must come to our office with identification, which could be a valid driver's license or Texas I.D. The water deposit will be applied to the balance on your final bill. It is important that you give us a forwarding address for the final bill and / or possible refund that may be due to you. The information for the final bill to collections is 90 days according to the policy.

Disconnection of Meter for Nonpayment
-------------------------------------

When water service has been disconnected for nonpayment, the required amount of the bill plus a reconnect fee must be paid to reinstate your service. Reconnection fees are:

* $45 for reconnection between the hours of 8 am to 4:00 pm.

### Payment

***Only cash, money order, or debit cards will be accepted as a form of payment to reconnect service. No checks are accepted once service has been disconnected for nonpayment.***

Maintenance / Service of Water Meters
-------------------------------------

If your water service has been suddenly interrupted and you do not know the cause, contact the Utility Billing Department at 972-218-1328 during normal business hours. If you have water service problems after hours due to an emergency situation, contact 972-218-2700.

### Reporting Water Problems

Customers should contact the Utility Billing Department to report water leaks, main breaks, or water quality problems. For sewer-related problems, contact 972-275-1752 during normal business hours or 972-218-2700 outside normal business hours.

Monthly Water Meter Reading
---------------------------

All water meters are read each month by electronic meter-reading technology by the Utility Billing Department meter tech employees.

Service Account Billing
-----------------------

Customers are billed monthly for water, sewer, stormwater, and refuse services. Payment is due no later than 20 days from the billing date. After day 20, a 10% penalty will be assessed on the current balance. If payment still has not been received within approximately 10 days after the due date, your service is subject to immediate disconnection, and you must pay a reconnect fee to reinstate your service.
