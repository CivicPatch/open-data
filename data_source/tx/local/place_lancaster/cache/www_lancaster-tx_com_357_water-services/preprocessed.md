a Rental Inspection must be performed and approved by the City of Lancaster, Development Services Department prior to transferring services. For more information, please contact 972-218-1200.

To disconnect your water service, customers must come to our office with identification, which could be a valid driver's license or Texas I.D. The water deposit will be applied to the balance on your final bill. It is important that you give us a forwarding address for the final bill and / or possible refund that may be due to you.
The information for the final bill to collections is 90 days according to the policy.

If your water service has been suddenly interrupted and you do not know the cause, contact the Utility Billing Department at 972-218-1328 during normal business hours. If you have water service problems after hours due to an emergency situation, contact 972-218-2700.

Customers should contact the Utility Billing Department to report water leaks, main breaks, or water quality problems. For sewer-related problems, contact 972-275-1752 during normal business hours or 972-218-2700 outside normal business hours.

All water meters are read each month by electronic meter-reading technology by the Utility Billing Department meter tech employees.

Customers are billed monthly for water, sewer, stormwater, and refuse services. Payment is due no later than 20 days from the billing date. After day 20, a 10% penalty will be assessed on the current balance. If payment still has not been received within approximately 10 days after the due date, your service is subject to immediate disconnection, and you must pay a reconnect fee to reinstate your service.
