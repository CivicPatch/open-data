Grant is proud of his Texas heritage and is a seventh-generation resident of Grimes County, dating back to when Texas was still a republic. His grandmother was born in Piedmont, but after the death of her father shortly after her birth, Grant’s great-grandmother moved to Houston to provide for the family. As a result, Grant and his four siblings were all born in Houston.

He began delivering newspapers in the third grade and continued through his sophomore year of high school, a fitting job, as his father was on staff at the
. In 1972, his parents, Robert and Pat, moved the family to Plantersville. Grant went on to work for two years at Silverstein’s Lucky 7 Grocery Store, which is now home to The Emporium. He was the drum major his senior year at Navasota High School and graduated in 1974.

During a college night event in Brenham, Grant attended a session for the Commonwealth College of Mortuary Science on a whim, and discovered his calling. He graduated from Commonwealth in 1977 and went on to work for Pat H. Foley Funeral Directors, Waltrip Funeral Home, and Geo. H. Lewis & Sons in Houston.

In 1980, Grant made a career change and joined GMAC, where he worked until 1987. During that time, he met his first wife, JoAnn Schrimpf. In December 1987, Grant purchased Lindley-Robertson Funeral Home, and the Lindley-Robertson-Holt Funeral Home was established. He and JoAnn married in October 1989 and worked side by side to manage the business until her passing in February 2013.

Feeling a deep Christian calling, Grant attended St. Mary’s Seminary at St. Thomas University and graduated in 1995 with a degree in Pastoral Theology. He served as a deacon for 27 years at Christ Our Light and St. Stanislaus Kostka Catholic Churches.

In September 2024, Grant married Mary Jane at St. Mary in Plantersville, becoming a cherished part of her family. Mary Jane’s husband had passed in 2022, and together she and Grant found love a second time.
