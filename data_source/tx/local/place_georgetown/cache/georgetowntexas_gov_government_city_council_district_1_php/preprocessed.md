Amanda is partial to historic areas and architecture, and made her home in a 1969 ranch style home in the historic overlay of Old Town Georgetown.  Amanda was taught by her parents the importance of community service and philanthropy and has served the community as an active volunteer. She feels fortunate to live, work, own a business and serve the vibrant community of Georgetown.

Amanda loves entertaining and socializing with friends and family, through her Bunco group, dinner club, bible study and book club to name a few. She’s always up for hosting a party, cooking a meal, or planning a fun outing!

* Growth: Maintain small-town charm while acknowledging the community’s desire for the amenities and resources of larger cities. Address the city’s growth through a clear strategy of leadership, fiscal responsibility and respectful development.
* Communication: Commit to engaging respectfully, often and in multiple ways (through social media, town halls, office hours, emails and written correspondence) with all citizens. It is my personal objective to be accessible, transparent and open-minded to all citizens of Georgetown and to my constituents in District 1.

With the approval of HB 1082 in May 2021, all elected officials' personal information is to be redacted from any public documents.
