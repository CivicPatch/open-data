Mayor's Corner Welcoming Message 

Welcome to Brownwood.  Whether you are a visitor to our city, a newcomer, or a life-long resident our goal is to provide you with the information you need about our community. 

Brownwood is a thriving city located near the geographic center of Texas.  Our location makes us the perfect spot for business and industry.  As the largest city in a 70 mile radius, we are a regional employer and hub for all types of commerce, education, and recreation.

Brownwood is also a great place to raise a family.  We are on the northern edge of the hill country and enjoy rolling hills, trees, and a large recreational lake.  We are home to some of the best hunting and fishing in Texas.  Our citizens enjoy all of these recreational perks with less than a ten-minute commute to work.

Our goal at the City of Brownwood is to promote health, safety, and quality of life for our citizens.  In recent years, we have constructed a family aquatics facility, new sports facilities for our youth, and a Senior Citizens Center among other similar projects.  We are committed to progress and hope you will choose to be a part of our community.
