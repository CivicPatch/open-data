Mayor and City Council
----------------------

The City Council meetings are held every second and fourth Monday of each month at 5:30 p.m. These meetings take place in the City Council Chambers located at City Hall, 121 W. 2nd Street. All residents are encouraged to attend as these meetings are open to the public.

Residents who wish to address the City Council regarding items on the Consent or Regular Agenda should approach the podium when their specific item is being considered. It is important to note that discussion by City Council Members will only occur when an agenda item is scheduled for consideration.

Before making comments, each speaker will be required to provide their name and residential address. To ensure that everyone has a fair opportunity to speak, speakers will be limited to a maximum of 3 minutes each. It is crucial for all participants to maintain decorum; therefore, any speakers making personal, impertinent, profane, or slanderous remarks will be removed from the meeting and will not be granted re-entry.

Agendas and minutes from City Council meetings are readily available for public viewing on the Agenda and Minutes section of the City’s website. This transparency allows residents to stay informed about council activities and decisions.
