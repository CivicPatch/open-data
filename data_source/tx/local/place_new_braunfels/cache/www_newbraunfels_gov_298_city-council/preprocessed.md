New Braunfels is one of the most unique places in all of Texas where we live, work, and play. From the Gruene Historic District to the downtown Farmers Market, the Guadalupe and Comal rivers, and all points in-between our city offers a uniqueness not seen anywhere else. From the time I visited New Braunfels in 1979, I fell in love. Our family was finally able to call New Braunfels home in 2015, after retiring from the US Army after 27 years.

District 4 is diverse, spanning from the new Texas Department of Public Safety Driver's License Office on Conrads Lane to the Gruene Historic District, to the Headwaters of the Comal River. The Guadalupe River flows within the district from the Gruene Road Bridge to the Common Street Bridge. With the Gruene nightlife, fabulous food, shopping, and river fun, there is something for all of us to be proud of, and help us enjoy living, working, and playing here. I am very grateful for the opportunity to serve New Braunfels as a City Councilman and represent the people in District 4.

Fully support the Police and Fire departments to address staffing and equipment issues in relation to growth and tourism by determining the proper size of protection for city residents and tourists
