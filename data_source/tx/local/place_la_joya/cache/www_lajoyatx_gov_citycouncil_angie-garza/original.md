===========

One of nine siblings, Angelica Garza was born in Edinburg, Texas to David B González and Otila Villarreal González. Garza attended Edinburg CISD schools and graduated from Edinburg High School in 1967, before attending Pan American University and marrying José Vicente Garza on July 4, 1969.  As proud parents of three and residents of La Joya, Texas, Garza and her husband were dedicated to helping their community. In partnership with the Boys & Girls Club in La Joya, the Garzas would sponsor various baseball teams from Sullivan City to Palmview, and provide transportation for required travel to game competitions in neighboring cities.

In March 1976, Garza began working for [La Joya ISD](https://www.lajoyaisd.com/) and did not retire from the district until 28 years later in 2004. Throughout her career with La Joya ISD and for several years after, Garza served as city commissioner for La Joya, (1987-2011), chairperson for Hidalgo County Metropolitan Policy Organization (1992-1994), president of the La Joya Lions Club (2002-2003), and is a past member of the [Texas Municipal League (TML)](https://www.tml.org/) and the [National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO)](https://naleo.org/).

Presently, Garza is a grandmother to five cherished grandchildren and remains committed to serving her community in various ways. Garza is a board member of the La Joya Economic Development Corporation (LJEDC), serves as a lector and Eucharistic Minister at Our Lady Queen of Angels Parish in La Joya, and also is an active member of the ACTS Organization at the same parish.
