Public Utility Dept.
====================

The La Joya Public Utility Department (PUD) mission is to provide quality water, wastewater and solid waste services at the best value to our customers.

Quick Facts

The La Joya Public Utility Department (PUD) was created by the Council as part of their reorganization of municipal government in 2022.

The La Joya PUD acquired some of its facilities from the former La Joya Water Supply Corporation (WSC), predecessor to the [Agua Special Utility District (SUD)](https://aguasud.com/).
