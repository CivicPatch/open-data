Three council members are elected at-large (Districts 1, 3, and 5), and three are elected by district (Districts 2, 4, and 6); all serve staggered three-year terms. The mayor is elected at-large and serves a three-year term.

Regular City Council meetings are held on the 1st and 3rd Tuesdays at 7 p.m. at Kyle City Hall, 100 W. Center Street.

The City Council welcomes comments from Citizens early in the agenda of meetings. Those wishing to speak are encouraged to sign in before the meeting begins. Speakers may be provided with an opportunity to speak during this time period on any agenda item or any other matter concerning city business, and they must observe the three-minute time limit.
