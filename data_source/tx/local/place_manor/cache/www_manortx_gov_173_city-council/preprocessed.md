City Council
============

The City of Manor is a diverse, sustainable community and regional leader with exceptional services, a high quality of life, and a safe environment for citizens and businesses to thrive.

[City of Manor Charter](https://library.municode.com/tx/manor/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=HOME_RULE_CHARTERCICHMATE)

The City of Manor is a "Home-Rule" city that operates as a Council-Manager form of government.  Pursuant to the provisions of, and subject only to the limitations imposed under the Texas Constitution and laws of this state and the charter, all powers of the city shall be vested in and exercised by an elective governing body, hereinafter referred to as the "city council" or "council." The council shall enact legislation, adopt budgets, determine policies, make appointments to positions as provided herein, and appoint the city manager who shall execute the laws and administer the government of the city.

The City of Manor is independent of the Manor Independent School District and other government agencies, including Travis County, the State of Texas, and Federal Agencies.

Manor's governing body is composed of six Council Members and a Mayor, all of whom have an equal vote in making decisions for the City.  The Mayor and the Council Members are elected at-large, by Place. While there are seven council places, they are not divided into geographic districts. Each seat on the council, except for the position of mayor, is numbered as Place 1 through Place 6.  The Council Member occupying a particular seat is identified by the Place number assigned to that council seat.

On November 3, 2020, Special Election, City of Manor residents voted for the approval of
