-------------------------

![Council Member Natasha Harper Madison](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/City-Council/NHarper-Madison_New2021_240x240%20(002).jpg)

Council Member Natasha Harper-Madison serves as the dedicated representative for Austin City Council District 1, known colloquially as the Eastside. Being born and raised within her district of Austin, she has developed a profound understanding of her community's culture and unique challenges over the years. Through her experience as a small business owner and local advocate, she developed invaluable insight and a deeper passion to serve the East Austin communities.

Council Member Harper-Madison's passion for grassroots activism ignited her aspiration to pursue public office, a goal she realized through her successful campaign for City Council in 2018. In a testament to her leadership and ambition, in 2020, her peers elected her as mayor pro-tem, making her the second Black woman on the Austin City Council to hold this esteemed title.

In her role as a City Council Member, she is proud to serve as Chair of the Housing and Planning Committee, focusing on affordability, equity, and sustainability. Additionally, she is a member of the Mobility Committee and the Capital Area Metropolitan Organization (CAMPO), where she plays a crucial role in shaping transportation policy to promote greater accessibility and safety.

Amidst her fervent advocacy for housing affordability, progressive mobility, and the expansion of economic opportunities, Harper-Madison stands as an irrepressible breast cancer survivor and a proud mother of four.
