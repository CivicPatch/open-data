### Council Member Mike Siegel

![Mike Siegel -  Council Member District 7](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/images/Council/Seigel_Mike_bio.jpg)

Mike Siegel was elected in 2024 to represent Austin’s District 7. He has devoted 25 years to public service, including as a public school teacher, nonprofit leader, and civil rights lawyer. Mike’s holds a B.A. from Brandeis University and a J.D. from Cornell Law School. He spent 5 years as an Assistant City Attorney for City of Austin where he co-authored and defended City policies, including the paid sick leave ordinance for City employees.

Mike’s wife, Dr. Hindatu Mohammed, owns and operates the Allandale Veterinary Clinic which cares for many of the neighborhood’s beloved pets. Together they live in Crestview with their two children, who attend local schools.

Spurred by his ties to the Labor Movement, Mike promises to be a strong voice for workers on the dais. He aims to take bold action against climate change to make our city more resilient to extreme weather, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and advance environmental justice by rectifying the disproportionate harm done to vulnerable communities.

Council Member Siegel serves on several committees that are central to his goals for climate action and affordable housing. As the Vice Chair to the Austin Energy Oversight Utilities Board, he wants to push for investments in renewable energy and battery storage technology while creating good “green jobs” for local workers. He is a member of the Housing and Planning Committee, the Economic Opportunity Committee, the Climate, Water, Environment and Parks Committee, and the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO).
