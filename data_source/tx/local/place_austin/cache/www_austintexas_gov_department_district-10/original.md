![Marc Duchen -  Council Member District 10](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/images/Council/Duchen_Marc_bio.jpg)

Austin City Council Member Marc Duchen was elected November 2024 to represent District 10, which includes parts of West, North, and Central Austin. His expertise in municipal policy, public safety, and effective community advocacy is built on a foundation of data and financial analysis. Marc is a graduate of The University of Texas at Austin and holds an MBA.

Council Member Duchen’s areas of policy focus include public safety, wildfire preparedness, environment and parkland, affordable housing, as well as efficient use of public funds.

In his first year on City Council, Marc has led the adoption of the latest Wildlife Urban Interface (WUI) Code, which is critical to making Austin safer in the face of growing wildfire danger. The council member has also initiated a program for preserving and producing affordable housing stock and stands out as a leader on effective city budget policy. Marc serves on the Audit & Finance Committee, the Climate, Water, Environment, & Parks Committee, the Public Safety Committee, and the Public Health Committee.
