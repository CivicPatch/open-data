District 5 Council Member
-------------------------

**Ryan Alter, Council Member for District 5**

![Ryan Alter -  Council Member District 5](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Council/Alter/Alter_Ryan_bio.jpg)
Trained with the analytical skills of an engineer from UT Austin and graduate of Harvard Law School, Ryan has proven he has the tools to tackle any challenge facing our community. At the Capitol and now in City Hall, Ryan has championed policies to create more opportunities for more people everywhere.

Since taking office in 2023, he has led on making Austin an affordable place to live for families, students, retirees, and workers, and been a fierce advocate for getting our unhoused neighbors a permanent place to call home.

As the lead sponsor of the Environmental Investment Plan and other policies that ensure we have clean air, fresh water, and abundant natural space to enjoy, Ryan has relentlessly pushed to protect our environment. Having fought for years fighting for progressive policies as a Capitol staff member for Senators Kirk Watson, Sylvia Garcia, and Juan “Chuy” Hinojosa, he understands it is going to take local solutions to meet the challenges of today.

Born at St. David’s South, Ryan is a lifelong Austin-area resident who now resides with his wife Rita and three children Aurora, Atticus, and Alistair in South Austin. You can find them at the local farmer’s markets, on the trails, or at the playground, and if you do, come say, "Hi!"
