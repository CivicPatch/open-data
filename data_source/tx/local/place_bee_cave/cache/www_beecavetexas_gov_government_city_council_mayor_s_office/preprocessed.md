Mrs. King grew up in Texas and graduated from Texas A&M University in 1998 with a degree in Biomedical Science.

Mayor King believes in balancing growth with the needs and quality of life of our community, while being respectful of the community's heritage. Bee Cave is a one of a kind community and it's position as the "Gateway to the Hill Country" needs to be protected and nurtured. The Mayor and her husband, Ben, met at A&M and moved around the first 8 years of their marriage while he was a pilot in the Marine Corps. They have 3 children: Wes (22), Brannon (17) and Tierney (16), and taking an active role in shaping the community where they grow up is something she passionately believes in. She loves history, traveling, cooking, cheering on her kids in their activities and Aggie football!
