============================

**During this year’s National Night Out, many residents will be participating in special events such as block parties, cookouts, and various other activities**
.  The intent of National Night Out is for neighbors to strengthen neighborhood friendships, so this year’s National Night Out activities will be hosted by neighbors of Hollywood Park.  We are encouraging residents to spend time with their immediate neighbors on Tuesday, October 7.

You can email the form to

, or you can bring it in to the Hollywood Park Police Department front desk (2 Mecca Drive) during normal business hours (
M-F 8am-5pm
).
