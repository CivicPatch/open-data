National Night Out[Shad Prichard](https://hollywoodpark-tx.gov/author/sprichard/ "Posts by Shad Prichard")2025-09-18T14:17:09-05:00

**National Night Out****Tuesday, October 7, 2025**
==================================================

National Night Out is designed to

* Strengthen neighborhood spirit and police-community partnerships
* Heighten awareness of crime and drug prevention
* Generate support for, and participation in, local anti-crime programs
* Send a message to criminals letting them know that neighborhoods are organized and fighting back.

The purpose of National Night Out is to build strong partnerships between the police and communities.  
Residents are encouraged to lock your doors, turn on your porch lights, gather with your neighbors to show unity against criminal activity.

**During this year’s National Night Out, many residents will be participating in special events such as block parties, cookouts, and various other activities**.  The intent of National Night Out is for neighbors to strengthen neighborhood friendships, so this year’s National Night Out activities will be hosted by neighbors of Hollywood Park.  We are encouraging residents to spend time with their immediate neighbors on Tuesday, October 7.

If you would like to participate in National Night Out by hosting a block party on your street, please complete and submit the registration form, found **[here](https://hollywoodpark-tx.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-National-Night-Out-Flyer.pdf)**.

Registration deadline is **5:00 p.m. October 02, 2025**.

You can email the form to [**pdadmin@hollywoodpark-tx.gov**](mailto:pdadmin@hollywoodpark-tx.gov), or you can bring it in to the Hollywood Park Police Department front desk (2 Mecca Drive) during normal business hours (M-F 8am-5pm).
