A Word From Our Mayor

I hope this message finds you well and that you are all enjoying a fantastic Spring Break! Over the past several days, our city has been buzzing with vibrant events and meaningful gatherings. One of the highlights was last Friday's unforgettable celebration of the 97th anniversary of the Roma-Miguel Aleman Suspension Bridge. This cherished tradition brings our communities together as we join our friends from Miguel Aleman at the heart of the bridge for the annual Abrazo ceremony. In this symbolic embrace, we exchange gifts and renew our shared commitment to the bridge's ongoing restoration — a powerful reminder of the unity that connects our two cities. I am proud to say that during my four and a half years in office, we have made remarkable progress in securing funds for essential engineering studies that will pave the way for the bridge's complete restoration. We are hopeful that this long-awaited project will come to life in the near future, restoring not only a vital connection but also a rich part of our shared history. Exciting developments are also on the horizon for Roma's historic district! Our Economic Development Corporation recently approved plans for three new businesses that will breathe fresh life into our beloved downtown area:

These exciting additions will promote tourism and infuse new energy into our historic district, the heart of our city. They are a testament to our community's growth and the bright future we are building together.
