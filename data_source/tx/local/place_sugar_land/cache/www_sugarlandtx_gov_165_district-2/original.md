Council Member Sanjay Singhal
-----------------------------

Sanjay Singhal was elected to represent District 2 on the Sugar Land City Council in June 2025. He led in both the general and runoff elections with broad support across all neighborhoods and communities to deliver transparent governance and balanced growth for our city.

Before joining City Council, Sanjay was an active community leader in Sugar Land. He served on the Telfair HOA Board for 5 years as the Board President for 3 years. Under his leadership, the Telfair HOA board demonstrated operational and fiscal excellence and reduced the annual fees for residents, while also increasing the capital reserve funds and continuing to deliver new community facilities and amenities.

He has played a key role in facilitating dialogue between city leadership and residents on a variety of issues, earning a reputation as a vocal advocate for residents.

Professionally, he is a retired global executive with over 30 years of experience at Schlumberger (SLB), one of the world’s leading energy services companies.

Starting his career as a field engineer, Sanjay came to hold key senior business, operational and technology roles around the world giving him experience leading large international teams, overseeing global budgets and ultimately, delivering results. He retired as the Vice President for Software Integrated Services at SLB, leading a team of 1000+ people across 80+ countries.

Since moving to Telfair, Sanjay has been deeply involved in civic life. In additional to his work with the HOA, he has collaborated with various community and sports groups, cultural and faith organizations, and environmental advocacy networks.
