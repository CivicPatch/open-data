The Sweeny Plantation was recognized as a Texas Historic Landmark, Marker No. 9600, in 1965.
When John Sweeny, Sr. came to Texas and settled in the western part of Brazoria County, he acquired extensive land holdings.  He made wooden rollers out of native live oaks and created a very successful sugar plantation.  His subsequent prosperity enabled him to give each of his children a plantation of their own.  John Sweeny, Jr., after returning from the Texas Revolution, was given this plantation.  The plantation was located on the Polley & Chance grant of Stephen F. Austin’s original “Old Three Hundred” contract with Mexico.  The house was built in 1837 by slaves using clay bricks, nails, and Cypress & Ash wood made on his land.  The 30 slave cabins were made of Cypress.  The plantation had its own sawmill, sugar house, cotton gin, blacksmith shop, commissary, and kiln for making bricks.  The residence still stands, though, considerably altered, on Highway 35, just west of Old Ocean.  It was the home of Mrs. Catherine Bannister, a descendant of the original family, until her passing in he 1970s.  It is still owned by descendants.
“John Sweeny, Jr., after returning from the Texas Revolution, was given this plantation by his father, an extensive landholder.  In 1837 slaves built the house, using only brick, nails and wood made on his land.  Molasses, cotton, sugar were produced.  Still owned by descendants. (1965)”
