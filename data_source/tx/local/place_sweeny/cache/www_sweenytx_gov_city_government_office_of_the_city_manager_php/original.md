**Office of the City Manager**  
The City of Sweeny is a home-rule municipality operating under a council-manager form of government. The powers of the City are vested in an elected council that enacts local legislation, determines city policies, and appoints the City Manager, who serves at the pleasure of the City Council.

The City Manager's Office oversees the day-to-day operations of the City and delivery of services and executing all city policies and ordinances, preparation and administration of the annual city budget, and staff organizational management. As Chief Executive Officer and head of the administrative branch of the city, the City Manager prepares recommendations to the Mayor and City Council and implements policy direction approved by the Mayor and City Council.

Council appointed David Jordan as City Manager on December 17, 2024.
