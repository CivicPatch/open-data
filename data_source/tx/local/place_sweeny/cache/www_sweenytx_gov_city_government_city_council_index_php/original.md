**INTRODUCTION**  
  
The City of Sweeny uses a Council-Manager form of government to provide effective and efficient public service to our residents.  Incorporated in 1945, Sweeny was governed by a General Rule Charter.  However, in 1999, the population of the City of Sweeny exceeded 5,000 residents, and the residents voted in favor of Home Rule legislation.  As a result, Sweeny adopted the Council-Manager approach—the most popular form of government in the United States today—when it received a charter from the Texas Legislature.  
  
In a Council-Manager form of government, council members represent the people in their geographic districts. Council members are elected to office.  The Council’s selection of a professional City Manager ensures efficient municipal services.  The City Manager is responsible for administering and coordinating municipal operations and programs.  City Council also appoints the City Secretary, City Attorney, Chief of Police, and citizens who serve on the city’s boards and commissions.  The Municipal Court Judge is an elected position.  
  
The organization of city government is much like that of state and federal government.  Government is organized into three branches: the Legislative branch, the Executive branch, and the Judicial branch.  The Legislative branch consists of the City Council which derives authority from a Charter granted by the State of Texas.  The Executive branch consists of the City Manager and the Mayor.  The Judicial branch consists of the Police, the Court, and, other legal services.

The City Council is comprised of a Mayor and five council members.  Council members are elected to and occupy positions on the City Council, such positions being numbers one, two, three, four, and five.  Members of the City Council, unless sooner removed under the provisions of the City Charter or the laws of the State of Texas, serve for a term of two (2) years.   Council member positions one, three, and five are elected each even numbered year, and positions two and four are elected each odd numbered year.  The Municipal Judge shall be filled each even numbered year. The office of Mayor shall be filled each odd numbered year.

Each member of City Council is required to be a citizen of the United States and a qualified voter of the State of Texas and City of Sweeny at the time of his or her election to office.  No member of the City Council may hold any other office or employment under the city government while serving on City Council, or hold any paid employment under the city government within two years thereafter.  Any member of the City Council ceasing to reside in the City will be deemed to have vacated his or her position on the City Council.  
Council members may not receive remuneration or compensation; however, they may be entitled to all necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties.  The Mayor shall receive such remuneration or compensation as may be established from time to time by the City Council.    
City Council meetings take place the third Tuesday of each month at 6:00 p.m. at City Hall.  These meetings are open to the public, unless otherwise posted.
