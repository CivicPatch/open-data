City Administrator
==================

Hamilton’s history and future are rooted in strong community values, thoughtful planning, and a high quality of life for residents, businesses, and visitors. The City Administrator works with the Mayor, City Council, staff, and community partners to carry out that vision through the day-to-day management of city government.

The City Administrator serves as the City’s chief administrative officer and is directly accountable to the City Council, carrying out the policy direction of the City’s elected leadership. The Administrator is responsible for the general superintending control, administration, and management of City operations, ensuring that the policies and objectives established by the City Council are effectively implemented.

In practice, the City Administrator:

* Coordinates the daily work of City departments and aligns their efforts with the priorities set by the City Council.
* Prepares and manages the City’s annual operating and capital budgets, with a focus on fiscal responsibility and long-term sustainability.
* Provides professional analysis and recommendations to support informed decision-making by the Mayor and City Council.
* Administers key contracts, grants, and interlocal agreements and ensures that City business is conducted in a transparent and accountable manner.
* Supports the work of City boards and commissions and helps connect their recommendations to Council action.

Through this work, the City Administrator serves as a central point of coordination for everyone who interacts with the City—whether they are seeking services, collaborating on regional initiatives, or partnering with Hamilton on projects and investments.
