What To Do About Your Citation
==============================

If you received a citation inside the City of Hamilton, please read this information carefully. You must take action by the **appearance date** shown on your citation. Ignoring a citation can result in additional fees, a charge of Failure to Appear, and other consequences allowed by law.

Nothing on this page is legal advice. If you have questions about your rights or options, you may wish to consult an attorney.

---

Step 1 – Make sure you have the right court
-------------------------------------------

This page applies to citations filed in the **City of Hamilton Municipal Court**.

* Your citation and paperwork should list **“City of Hamilton Municipal Court, 200 E. Main Street, Hamilton, TX 76531”**.
* You may also have received a white Municipal Court form with fine information and options.

**Important:** If your citation was issued for an offense **outside the Hamilton city limits**, it is usually handled by the **Justice Court of Hamilton County**, not the City. Those citations are typically accompanied by a BLUE FORM (Justice Court).

If your paperwork is blue, or if your citation lists the Justice Court of Hamilton County, please follow the instructions on that form and pay the **Justice Court of Hamilton County**, not the City’s online system. If you are unsure which court has your case, call **(254) 386-1221** before making a payment.

---

Step 2 – Know your deadline
---------------------------

You must respond to your citation by the **appearance date** printed near the bottom of your ticket. You may:

* Appear in person at Municipal Court,
* Contact the Court by phone, email, or mail, or
* Take care of your citation online, if that is the option you choose.

If you mail anything to the Court, it should be **postmarked on or before** your appearance date.

---

Step 3 – Understand your main options
-------------------------------------

Your specific options depend on the offense, your record, and Texas law. Common options include:

### 1. Pay the fine and court costs

Paying the citation (by mail, in person, or online) is usually treated as a **plea of guilty or no contest**. This generally:

* Waives your right to a trial, and
* May result in a conviction being reported as allowed by law.

You may be able to request a payment plan or other arrangements if you cannot pay the full amount at once. Contact the Court before your due date to discuss options.

### 2. Request a driver safety course

For many traffic offenses, eligible drivers may request a **driver safety course** to keep a moving violation off their record. Not all offenses or drivers qualify, and there are specific deadlines and requirements under Texas law.

To see if you qualify, contact the Municipal Court before your due date or review the **Driver Safety Course Request** form listed under Municipal Court forms.

### 3. Ask about deferred disposition

In some cases, the Judge may allow **deferred disposition** (a type of probation). If deferred disposition is granted and you complete all conditions, your case may be dismissed as permitted by law. This option is not available for every offense.

### 4. Plead not guilty and request a trial

You have the right to plead **Not Guilty** and request a trial before a Judge or a jury. To do this, follow the instructions on your citation paperwork or contact the Court before your appearance date. The Court will schedule a trial or pre-trial setting and provide further instructions.

---

Special rules for juveniles and certain offenses
------------------------------------------------

* **Juveniles (under 17 years of age)** are generally required by state law to appear in open court with a parent or legal guardian. Do **not** pay a juvenile citation online unless the Court has specifically instructed you to do so.
* Additional appearance requirements may apply for certain offenses (for example, some alcohol or tobacco violations by minors). Check your citation and paperwork carefully and contact the Court with any questions.

---

Step 4 – How to take care of your citation
------------------------------------------

### Online payment

You may be able to pay your citation online. Paying online is usually treated as a plea of guilty or no contest.

* Click the **“Pay My Citation Online”**.
* For the initial payment, the **name on the credit or debit card must match the name on the citation.**

### By mail

You may mail your completed Municipal Court form and payment to:

**Hamilton Municipal Court**  
200 E. Main Street  
Hamilton, TX 76531

Make checks or money orders payable to the **City of Hamilton**. Do not mail cash. Mailed responses should be postmarked on or before your appearance date.

### In person

You may visit the Municipal Court window at City Hall during lobby hours to:

* Ask questions about your citation,
* Submit paperwork, or
* Make a payment.
