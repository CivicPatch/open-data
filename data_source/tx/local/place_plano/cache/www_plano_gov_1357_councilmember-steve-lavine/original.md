Councilmember Steve Lavine
==========================

Steven Lavine was elected to Plano City Council Place 5 in May 2025, stepping into an unexpired term that will continue until May 2027. Steve brings more than 15 years of civic engagement and leadership to his role. A 40-year resident of Plano, he has been deeply involved in community initiatives and is committed to the city's growth and well-being.

Education and Experience
------------------------

A native of Chicago, Lavine's educational background includes a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science in Advertising Management from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Professionally, he is a retired marketing research entrepreneur, a career that honed his skills in communication, negotiation, and strategic planning.

Steve’s two adult sons are both graduates of Plano ISD schools. His extensive involvement in serving Plano’s youth include serving on the boards of Plano Youth Leadership and the local district of Scouting America (formerly the Boy Scouts of America.) For over 20 years, Steve also served as an active adult leader in Troop 1000 in Plano.

Steve’s leadership extended to his homeowners association, where he served as president for six years, and he is a member of the Citizens Emergency Response Team (CERT).

Steve is a passionate supporter of the Plano Public Library. As chairman of the Library Advisory Board, he was instrumental in increasing the availability of eBooks and audiobooks, enhancing access to digital resources for the community. He is also a leader in the Friends of the Plano Library. A rabid Broadway fan and supporter of the arts, Steve served on the Cultural Arts Plan Advisory Committee.

Steve's vision for Plano focuses on addressing the challenges of a maturing city. He emphasizes the importance of investing in aging infrastructure, including roads, libraries, and public safety facilities, to maintain the city's high quality of life. Understanding the critical role of Plano's corporate tax base, Steve also plans to advocate for policies that attract and retain businesses, thereby alleviating the tax burden on residents and sustaining the city's economic vitality. His approach to governance is characterized by inclusivity, transparency, and a commitment to consensus-building.

Personal Life
-------------

Steve and his wife, Mary Jacobs, have four adult children and live on Plano’s west side with their bossy 5-pound Yorkie, Lulu.
