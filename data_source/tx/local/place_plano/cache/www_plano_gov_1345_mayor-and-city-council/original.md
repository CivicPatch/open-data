Mayor and City Council
======================

The City of Plano defines excellence. Through visionary leadership, the City of Plano has grown from a premier suburb of Dallas into its own destination with:

* World-class amenities
* Beautiful neighborhoods
* High-quality services
* Blue Ribbon schools
* Superior transportation accessibility
* A thriving economy

Form of Government
------------------

Plano is governed by the Council-Manager form of government, where the Council sets City policy and the Manager is responsible for City operations. The City Council consists of the mayor and seven City Council members, all of whom are elected at-large, which means that all Council Members represent the entire City, with an additional district-specific residency requirement for candidates who run for Places 1 through 4. Likewise, the entire City may vote for all eight places, regardless of where they reside in Plano. Each Council Member serves a four-year term, and all members are limited to no more than two consecutive terms.

Of the eight Council Places, candidates running and serving in places one, two, three and four must reside in that district. Residing in the first four districts is the only distinction separating Council Members in places one through four from places five through eight.

Our Mission
-----------

The Office of the Mayor and City Council works diligently to guide City staff to achieve Plano's mission as a regional and national municipal leader, providing outstanding services and facilities through cooperative efforts that engage our citizens and that contribute to the quality of life in our community.

City Council Meetings
