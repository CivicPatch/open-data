Mayor John B. Muns
==================

Mayor John B. Muns became Plano’s 40th Mayor on May 10, 2021, and was reelected in May 2025. Prior to becoming mayor, he served the Plano community in many capacities, including a variety of leadership roles. His most recent position was Chair of the Planning and Zoning Commission. Prior to that, he served on the Economic Development Board.

Mayor Muns has an extensive background focusing on educating Plano’s children. He served on the Plano Independent School District Board as a Trustee for sixteen years with three of those years as President.

One of his core beliefs is if you want to live in a vibrant community, you should give back to your community through service.

As Mayor, John is committed to listening to Plano’s citizens and providing transparency in services by leveraging resources to share the many ways our City is accessible. The idea is to improve by working in partnership with our citizens in a collaborative way.

Economic development will continue to be a high priority as we look to remain an employment center for the region, and a destination location for businesses large and small who want to be in a business-friendly community that offers world-class amenities and a great place for their employees to live, work and play.

Mayor Muns is a member of the United States Conference of Mayors and the National League of Cities.

Mayor Muns’ commitment to our youth and their families is unwavering. The Plano Mayor’s Summer Internship Program continues to offer our high school students a life-changing experience in our premier companies through an eight-week internship. Nourishing Hope and Plano Families First provide our underserved families with additional resources in the way of health screenings, jobs, activities in our city and so much more.

His life in Plano has always included community service. He has served on many boards including Children’s Medical Center, YMCA, Plano Sports Authority, Journey of Hope, and City House among others.
