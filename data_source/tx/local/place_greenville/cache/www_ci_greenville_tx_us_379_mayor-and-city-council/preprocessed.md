Welcome to Greenville, Texas, and thank you for taking the opportunity to learn what so many families and businesses have already discovered about our warm and friendly community.
Located less than an hour’s drive from the Dallas-Fort Worth area, Greenville is ideally situated to offer the conveniences of a big city alongside the small-town atmosphere that East Texans treasure.
Our growing and diverse business community includes major defense contractor and aerospace industry leader L-3 Mission Integration, global specialty chemicals and materials companies Cytec Industries Inc., FSTI and Fritz Industries, major oilfield service company Weatherford Inc., and world-class agricultural and construction equipment manufacturer CNH (Case New Holland). A growing pool of small businesses speaks to the entrepreneurial spirit of this area, as well as an expanding local economy.
Our school district boasts a world-champion robotics team and inventive programs such as Destination Imagination and Suzuki Strings that develop our children’s interests in math, science and the arts in creative and innovative ways. We pride ourselves on providing a quality local parks system, including the Greenville SportsPark, and activities to keep our youth engaged and active.
Downtown Greenville’s wineries, eateries and retail shops cater to diverse interests and host numerous community events throughout the year. The revitalization projects in our Main Street district honors the city’s rich history. The Texan Theater and our own GMA (Greenville Municipal Auditorium) bring entertainment to our doorstep by regularly featuring accomplished musical artists through the Threadgill Concert Series, Greenville Entertainment Series and Dallas Symphony in Greenville.
