2020 Census
-----------

* You will receive your questionnaire in March either by U.S. mail or hand delivery.  Some people in remote areas will be counted in person.
* The U.S. Constitution requires a national census once every 10 years to count the population and determine the number of seats each state will have in the U.S. House of Representatives.
* Households should complete and mail back their questionnaires upon receipt.  Households that do not respond may receive a replacement questionnaire in early April.  Census takers will visit households that do not return questionnaires.

* Every year, the federal government allocates more than $400 billion to states and communities based, in part, on census data.
