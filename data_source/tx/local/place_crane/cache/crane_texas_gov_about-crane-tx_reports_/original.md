###### Census INformation

2020 Census
-----------

* **What:**The Census is a count of everyone residing in the United States.
* **Who:**  All U.S. residents must be counted – both citizens and non-citizens.
* **When:**You will receive your questionnaire in March either by U.S. mail or hand delivery.  Some people in remote areas will be counted in person.
* **Why:**  The U.S. Constitution requires a national census once every 10 years to count the population and determine the number of seats each state will have in the U.S. House of Representatives.
* **How:**Households should complete and mail back their questionnaires upon receipt.  Households that do not respond may receive a replacement questionnaire in early April.  Census takers will visit households that do not return questionnaires.

### The importance of a Complete Count in Census Data

* Every year, the federal government allocates more than $400 billion to states and communities based, in part, on census data.
* Census data is used to determine locations for retail stores, schools, hospitals, new housing developments, and other community facilities.
* Census data determines boundaries for state and local legislative and congressional districts.
