###### History of the City Secretary

The City Secretary is one of the oldest public servant roles in local government.

The role which has had many different titles existed in Biblical times as the “Keeper of the Archives”, and before written records came into use, as “Remembrancer” because their memory served as the public record.

In ancient Greece, each meeting of the governing body began with the City Secretary reading aloud the documents to be considered, and pronouncing a curse on anyone who would seek to deceive the people.
