City Council
============

The municipal government provided by the city charter consists of a mayor and council members, elected by the people and responsible to the people. The Dimmitt city council is composed of the mayor and seven council members. The mayor and three council members are elected from the city at-large, and the remaining four council members are elected from single member districts. Each district is numbered one through four consecutively. The mayor and all council members are elected to serve for two-year terms.

The City Council meets on the third Monday of every month at 6:30 p.m. If there is a need for a special meeting to be called, notice of this open meeting will be posted at least 72 hours before the meeting is scheduled to begin.
