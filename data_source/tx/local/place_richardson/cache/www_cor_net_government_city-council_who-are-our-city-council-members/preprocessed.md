This page contains the latest news and information relating to the City Council at the City of Richardson. The Richardson City Council consists of the Mayor, two at-large seats and four place, or district, seats. Though members representing Place 1 thru 4 must reside in those areas, all members of the City Council are elected at-large by voters. Once elected, council members choose the Mayor Pro Tem from among the elected members. All City Council seats carry two-year terms, and are up for election during May of every odd year. Term limits for membership on the City Council are limited to 6 terms, or 12 consecutive years.

Richardson City Council has made government transparency one of its priorities.
