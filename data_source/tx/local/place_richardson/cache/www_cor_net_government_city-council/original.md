**Government**

Voters approved a home rule charter in 1956 establishing a Council/Manager form of government. The Council/Manager form of government is the system of local government that combines the strong political leadership of elected officials in the form of a council, with the managerial experience of an appointed local government manager. A representative system of government is established where all power is concentrated in the elected council and where the council hires a professionally trained manager to oversee the delivery of public services.

### **Elections**

The Richardson City Council consists of the Mayor, two at-large seats and four place, or district, seats. Though members representing Place 1 thru 4 must reside in those areas, all members of the City Council are elected at-large by voters. All City Council seats carry two-year terms, and are up for election during May of every odd year. Term limits for membership on the City Council are limited to 6 terms, or 12 consecutive years.

### **Responsibilities**

Council members are responsible for hiring the City Manager, appointing the City Attorney, City Secretary, Municipal Court Judges, City Health Officer and citizens to the City’s boards and commissions. The Council is also responsible for passing City ordinances, planning for capital improvements, issuing and selling municipal bonds, purchasing and selling property, establishing City departments, determining City services, approving the annual budget, and setting the City’s tax rate. The City Manager is responsible for the City’s daily operations, hiring department heads, supervising the City personnel, directing and coordinating all municipal programs, enforcing all municipal laws and ordinances, and recommending an annual budget.
