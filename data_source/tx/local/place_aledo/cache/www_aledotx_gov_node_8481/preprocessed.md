Summer Jones is a wife, mother and friend to many. Her name might sound familiar as she made quite the introduction after moving with her family to Aledo in 2020 from Fort Worth, when she started to build a chicken coop in her backyard. The City of Aledo had conflicting ordinances on keeping fowl, so action was needed. Working with the Planning and Zoning Committee, the City Manager, City Council and Mayor, Summer helped amend the ordinance to allow backyard chickens - an experience that showed her how city government touches everyday life.

Encouraged by friends a few years later, she ran for Aledo City Council, where she now serves with a focus on fiscal responsibility and steady, sustainable growth. Since joining in 2023, she has been part of milestones like building a new City Hall, bringing the library into the city’s framework, creating a dedicated police department and lowering the tax rate for the first time since 2021.

Summer holds a finance degree from Texas A&M and an MBA from the University of Texas at San Antonio. She stepped away from her career to raise her three sons and invest in her community through Junior League, PTO, Athletic Booster, Young Men’s Service League and Christ Chapel Bible Church Women’s Board. She has also mentored many young women and shared at women’s events, encouraging others to lead with conviction, confidence and faith.

Summer and her husband have been married 27 years and have three sons - two in college and one at Aledo High School. She often tells them,
She applies that same phrase as a guiding principle in her own service to the community. At home, she enjoys Pilates, yoga, photography, cooking, reading, writing and caring for her chickens.
