CITY OF MULESHOE
----------------

### CITY COUNCIL STANDARDS OF CONDUCT

Every elected city office is one of trust and service to the citizens of Muleshoe.  The Mayor and Councilmembers are expected to govern this city in a manner associated with preservation of the values and integrity of representative local government and principles of democracy. To further these objectives, certain principles shall govern the conduct of the Mayor and Councilmembers in his or her relations with the citizens, the city manager, city staff, and fellow elected officials.

Be diligent to obey state law, city charter, and local ordinances that mandate or restrain the acts of local officials, such as nepotism and conflict of interest laws.

Be conscientious in relations with the city manager and his/ her staff so as not to improperly influence city officials or policies, or to thwart the execution of any city ordinance, rules or regulations.

Be careful not to use the elected position or the information to which the official becomes privy for personal gain, profit, or benefit; and further, neither seek nor accept any gift or benefit that might influence, or appear to influence, an official decision or duty.

Be faithful to safeguard confidential information, including all discussions in closed meetings, realizing that in sensitive matters, mutual trust is essential to assure the free flow of ideas from city staff to elected officials and, among those officials themselves.

Be sensitive to the appearance or impression that an elected official can personally intervene and provide special influence on an official decision or act of the city.  Accordingly, do not personally represent any person, group or entity before any city board, commission, committee or council when there is the potential for personal gain in that matter.

The Mayor and Councilmembers hereby covenant to hold themselves mutually accountable to this standard of conduct by all means available to them, always remembering that it is the People who hold the ultimate right, power, and means to hold accountable their elected officials for conduct while in office.

**Signed this the 19th day of June, 2023.**

**Colt Ellis, Mayor**

**Crystal Alarcon, Councilmember District One        Austin Atchley, Councilmember District Three**

**Lupe Mendoza, Councilmember District Two         Gary Parker, Councilmember District Four**
