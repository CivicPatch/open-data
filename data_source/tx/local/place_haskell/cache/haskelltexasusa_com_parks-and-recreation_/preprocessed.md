Haskell Municipal RV Park is owned and operated by the City of Haskell. It is located at 401 South Avenue C. It has 36 spaces (most of them are pull thru) and provides water, sewer, and electricity services (30 and 50 amp hook-ups). We also offer an on-site public facility with showers.

Located within a short walking distance to the west are the tennis courts, city pool, a paved walking path, as well as the park which offers picnic areas with BBQ grills. To the east, also within walking distance, are the Civic Center, rodeo grounds, and both baseball and softball fields.

You may pay at City Hall located 2 blocks north at 301 South 1st between 8:00 A.M. – 5:00 P.M. Monday – Friday.

A night box is located on the west side at the drive-thru window at City Hall for after-hour payments.

The City of Haskell Public Golf Course is located North East of town.
The Course is managed by an appointed Golf Course Board and is open for daily play for a small fee posted at the course.
There is a club house available for rent and the course can be rented for a fee for family events or tournaments.
For more information contact City Hall at 940-864-2333.
