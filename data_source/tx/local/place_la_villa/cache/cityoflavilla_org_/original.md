Good Afternoon Residents, Just an update on the gas leak. Texas Gas Service has been working hard to repair the situation. The job is expected to take anywhere from 4 to 8 hours. During that time, you may experience low to no gas pressure. We encourage residents to limit traffic to the affected area on Gumwood and 6th St. We will update you all as soon as the repairs are complete. Thank you, Administration

Good Evening Residents, We are excited to announce that street improvements to Cardinal Lane have been completed and we will be starting on Cottonwood Ave tomorrow. We ask parents to please use caution when picking up their children from school. We anticipate the repairs will take 2-3 weeks -weather permitting. Thank you, Board and Administration

\*Addendum: This closure also includes the baseball fields\* Good Evening Residents, We are happy to announce that construction has started on improvements to our city park! Unfortunately, this means the park will be closed until the renovations are complete. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause but rest assured crews will work hard to complete the updates soon. Thank you, Administration
