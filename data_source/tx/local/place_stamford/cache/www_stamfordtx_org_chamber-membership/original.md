### Supporting Local Business and Tourism

The Stamford Chamber of Commerce was established in 1967 to advance agricultural, civic, commercial and industrial interests of the City of Stamford and adjacent communities. The Chamber works to promote a strong business community in Stamford through events, programs and community partnerships.

Being a member of the Stamford Chamber of Commerce is more than an annual due or displaying a membership sticker. **Being a member is about being an invested member in the economy and tourism of Stamford. It also provides numerous services to your business, as well supports local community events and programs. It’s easy to become a member!**

### Become a 2025-2026 Member Today!

**2025-2026 Membership is valid from April 1, 2025 - March 31, 2026.**

Chamber membership fees are annual and can be paid via cash, check, or card.

Tiers are based on **total number of employees, including yourself.**

*For example, you operate a business with 3 full time employees and 1 part-time employee. Your membership would fall under the 2-4 employees as there are 5 total people in your business.*

Standard membership benefits are offered to all annual Chamber members, with the exception of political candidates (please see FAQs for more information).

Keep scrolling for more information about our membership benefits and FAQs.

### Frequently Asked Questions

* #### I own multiple businesses. Do I have to purchase membership for both?

  Yes, your standard membership only covers one local business. Your second business may be added at a 20% discount based on the number of employees + you for a membership of equal or lesser value.
* #### My business has multiple branches. Does my membership cover all the branches?

  *Benefits will only directly apply to the local Stamford branch, or closest branch to Stamford.*
* #### Are political candidates, representatives, or political action committees and community groups allowed to be members?

  *We welcome all individuals who support Stamford and our businesses to be members, though we cannot express support or endorse any political candidates, including any advertising or promotional benefits paid for by the Chamber of Commerce. Politically affiliated members are invited to attend any event on their own accord to network and meet community members*
* #### My business isn’t located in Stamford. Can I still be a member?

  *Yes, your business is welcome where ever it is located. There are no city limits or regional boundaries that exclude any business which wants to join the Stamford Chamber of Commerce. We only ask that your company provides services or products in or around the community of Stamford.*
* #### My business is exclusively online. How does a Chamber Membership benefit me?

  Being a member of the Chamber of Commerce can add legitimacy to your online business. Plus, we offer a number of resources and workshops that may be beneficial to you as you seek to grow and promote your business online.
* #### Is membership actually worth it for my business?

  + The answer to whether joining is worth it depends on your specific business needs and circumstances. Here are a few questions to help you decide:

    - Do you want to expand your network and connect with other local business owners?
    - Are you looking for ways to increase your business’s visibility and credibility?
    - Do you want access to resources and support to help your business grow?
    - Can you afford the membership fee and commit time to participate in Chamber activities?
  + If you answered “yes” to most of these questions, joining the Stamford Chamber of Commerce could be a smart move for your business.
