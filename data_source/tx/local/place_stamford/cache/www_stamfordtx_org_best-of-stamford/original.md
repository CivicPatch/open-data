### Bet on Stamford this year!

We're going "all in" on celebrating Stamford this year! Join us for our Annual Best of Stamford event - Presented by the Stamford Chamber of Commerce. Our Chamber Members as well as our community are invited to join us **Saturday, February 7, 2025** at the **Old Timers Round Up Hall**, just south of the TCR Rodeo Groups to have a fun-filled night to fundraise for our Chamber of Commerce and to celebrate some of our local “Bests” with an award ceremony.

Doors open at 5:30 p.m. and will end at 8:45 p.m.

\*\***All tickets must be pre-purchased at** [**this link**](https://givebutter.com/2026bos) **or from the Chamber of Commerce.**

This year's fundraising event will feature a professionally run casino night, from The E-Casino Events in Dallas, complete with craps, roulette, and black jack! Your pre-purchased tickets includes $1000 additional "play money" to spend at the tables and a **free** raffle ticket to enter into our drawings at the end of the evening.
