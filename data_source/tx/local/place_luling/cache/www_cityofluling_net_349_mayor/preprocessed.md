**MAYOR'S WELCOME MESSAGE**
===========================

On behalf of the City Council, I would like to take a moment to welcome you to Luling, Texas.

As your Mayor, I want to convey how excited I am about serving you in a manner that will be productive, prosperous, and unifying.  Luling and it’s residents are worthy of the best, and it is my mission to achieve great things for our community.  That is my commitment to you.  Together, we can move our community forward in an unprecedented manner. We should position ourselves so that we minimize the pains of growth while maximizing the opportunities it will provide.  My vision is for all of our citizens to have a voice in what we become – saving what we treasure about Luling while working together to create something special for our children and grandchildren.

We are open for business and are here to serve you whether you are just visiting or considering our city for your final destination.  We are thankful for the businesses we have and look forward to welcoming new businesses in the future.
