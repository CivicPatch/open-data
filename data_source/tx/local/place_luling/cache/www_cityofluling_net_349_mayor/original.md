**MAYOR'S WELCOME MESSAGE**
===========================

On behalf of the City Council, I would like to take a moment to welcome you to Luling, Texas.

As your Mayor, I want to convey how excited I am about serving you in a manner that will be productive, prosperous, and unifying.  Luling and it’s residents are worthy of the best, and it is my mission to achieve great things for our community.  That is my commitment to you.  Together, we can move our community forward in an unprecedented manner. We should position ourselves so that we minimize the pains of growth while maximizing the opportunities it will provide.  My vision is for all of our citizens to have a voice in what we become – saving what we treasure about Luling while working together to create something special for our children and grandchildren.

We are open for business and are here to serve you whether you are just visiting or considering our city for your final destination.  We are thankful for the businesses we have and look forward to welcoming new businesses in the future.

Luling is known for it’s Watermelon Thump Festival, great BBQ, Rajun Cajun Festival, Night in Old Luling, Oil Museum Cook-Off and Car Show and also soon to be the home of the largest Buc-ee’s.

We are strategically located in beautiful Caldwell County just off Interstate 10, SH130, Highway 80, Highway 183 and Highway 90.   You can live in a caring community with a small town atmosphere and still take advantage of our proximity to larger cities.

We have the beautiful San Marcos River which has parks that can be enjoyed from several locations.  The beautiful Zedler Mill Complex is located on the San Marcos River and is an event center for weddings, conferences, reunions and parties.   We have a beautiful golf course and numerous parks located within our town for families to enjoy.

Luling has numerous civic clubs, churches and organizations that are helpful and welcoming.

Ultimately, I hope to provide the leadership that will inspire all of us to continue taking the necessary steps to ensure that Luling is second to none as a great place to live, work and raise our children.
