Welcome to the City of DeCordova! DeCordova incorporated as a municipality of the State in 2000. We are proud to be the 1st city incorporated in Texas in the new millennium, and we celebrate our 20th year.  We should all recognize the past leaders Dick Pruitt, Pat Revill and Todd Hall for their guidance and tireless efforts to keep our community safe and secure. We have many new faces on the council this year, and we hope you will take a moment to get to know them in the following pages. We appreciate the service that our outgoing council members have given to the City of DeCordova. Our City continues to grow, and encounter new challenges every year. All of our agendas are posted in advance, and meetings are open to the public. Several people have asked about the difference between the duties of the City and the HOA. The simplest answer is that the City of DeCordova will only act within it’s authority given and mandated by the State of Texas. And, funds that are approved to be used by the City must benefit all of the citizens therein. Your government has been responsible at least in part for the following

* Coordinated the erection of the directional sign on Highway 377 with Hood County Development District 1, United Cooperative Services, and Pecan Plantation Owners Association to help visitors find the Acton / DeCordova / Pecan Plantation area easily.
* Purchasing 5 defibrillators for the use of the citizens of our city.

To help you be more informed about your city government, this information is provided by your city council. The council meets monthly, on the 3rd Tuesday at 5301 Country Club Drive, Granbury, Texas  76049. We begin with a workshop at 6:45 p.m., followed by the regular meeting at 7:00 p.m. All meetings are open to the public and we want you to feel welcome to attend. For any other information, please contact your city cityofdcsecretary@gmail.com.

-DAVE HANSON, Mayor
