### John Deal

Council Member

John and wife Shelley moved to DCBE from San Antonio, TX in 2016. The attraction was being closer to family, the fabulous amenities offered by the community and the low cost associated with living in a city so close to DFW airport. John is retired after 30 plus years in the plastics industry, the most recent with Klockner Pentaplast, a global leader in packaging products.

Both John and Shelley are active in DCBE and serve on multiple committees that support our great community. The goal in being active in the city is to preserve the small town feeling of DCBE and the unique lifestyle afforded by this vibrant community. We feel blessed to give back to the city.

### Larry Barclay

Council Member

Larry was raised in Ft Worth, lived his adult life in Burleson/Johnson County and moved to DeCordova full-time in 2018. A graduate of TCU, Larry spent his adult work life with the Arlington Police Department – he is now joyfully retired from law enforcement. A father of two grown kids, Larry’s now showers his affection on his two exquisite mixed breed dogs, Buddy and Bella. Golf, travel, hunting, boating, volunteer work and naps take up most his time. Larry is typically accompanied by his partner-in-crime and (mostly) lovely wife, Karen – except for the nap part. When asked about DeCordova, Larry reflects on a simple life without too much work, surrounded by nature and the company of good friends.

### Kay Bailey

Council Member

Texas born & raised, Kay and her late husband Joe moved to DCBE in 2007 from Ft. Walton Beach/Destin FL, fondly known as “The Redneck Rivera”. The draw to DeCordova Bend was Kay’s Mom & Dad, Karon Sue & Tommy Runnels who had lived here many years, served on the BoD, committees, etc. By profession, Kay is a REALTOR® for Peerless Realty Group. She served on the Board of Directors for the Granbury Association of REALTORS® 2010-2020. In 2016, she was awarded REALTOR® of the Year. In 2016 & 2017, Best of the Best and Top Producer Sales for Coldwell Banker. Kay and Joe previously owned “Bailey’s” in Arlington, where Texas Monthly named it #2 Blues Bars in Texas. Upon the pub’s sale, Joe and Kay got on their 42-foot cabin cruiser, Ris\*Kay II, in League City, TX headed to moor the boat in the FL Keys where they discovered the beautiful waters of the Emerald Coast in the panhandle of Florida. They stayed seven years until it was time to come back to Texas. Joe served in the United States Air Force as an F- 4 Phantom Fighter pilot and retired from Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) as a safety investigator for their air fleet. He so loved DCBE & always said he would only  
 leave DeCordova “Feet first” & he did in 2017. Kay & Joe both believe that when you die & go to Heaven……it’s a lateral move!
