**WHAT IS THE CITY COUNCIL?**Like state and federal government, city government is organized to balance the legislative, executive, and judicial powers. City Council is the legislative branch, which derives authority from a charter granted by the State of Texas; the city manager is the chief executive officer; and the Municipal Courts judge the guilt or innocence of those accused of breaking city laws and determine punishment for those who are guilty. **MEETINGS OF THE CITY COUNCIL**

• Citizen participation at Council meetings is encouraged.  
• Meetings are normally held on the 1st and 3rd Tuesday of each month at 5:30pm at the City of Alpine Council Chambers.
