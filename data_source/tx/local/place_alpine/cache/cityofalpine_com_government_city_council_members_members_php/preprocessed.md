**Current Term:**

When it came time for Rick Stephens to retire after a 33-year career at the Boeing Company, he and his wife Elane Neu Scott (an Alpine native) felt there was no better place to live than Alpine. Between them, they have 5 grown children and 13 grandchildren.
Rick’s career has included leading large-scale businesses including guidance and control systems, submarine combat systems, space shuttle, homeland security, and responsibility in the C-suite for global facilities, IT systems, human resources, and administration. He has testified before Congress, was appointed by the President to be a member of the President’s Board of Advisors for Tribal Colleges and Universities, and was appointed by three US cabinet secretaries to serve in various capacities on boards and commissions.
Rick’s focus after his work career has been about giving back, serving today on boards for the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation, Digital Promise, and Sul Ross State University. As a Native American and former tribal chairman, he continues to support the American Indian Science and Engineering Society as the chair emeritus.
Rick is a former US Marine Corps Officer. He holds a BA in Mathematics from the University of Southern California, a MS in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton, and completed the majority of his work toward an MBA at Claremont Graduate School.
Having served three full and a partial term on the Alpine City Council from 2014 to 2021, Rick believes in the importance of community engagement and dialogue so that working together, we can help Alpine be the best it can be. He is excited to once again serve Ward 5 on the Alpine City Council.
