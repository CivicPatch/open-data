### Jesus “Jesse” Ramirez

“Growing up in San Juan shaped who I am, and I am committed to shaping a future where every resident has the opportunity to thrive and succeed.”
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

San Juan is more than just my hometown—it’s my foundation, my community, and my passion. As your City Commissioner and a member of the San Juan Economic Development Corporation (EDC) Board, I am committed to fostering economic growth, expanding opportunities, and improving the quality of life for all residents.

I understand the challenges our community faces because I’ve lived them. That’s why I will work tirelessly to support local businesses, invest in infrastructure, and create new opportunities that empower our families and future generations. Together, we will build a stronger, more prosperous San Juan.
