As a Councilmember, I am committed to keeping Colleyville a unique residential oasis by protecting the remaining green spaces and trees, keeping property values high by keeping the density of development low, and keeping our taxes affordable by managing city finances conservatively. I will work hard to attract new businesses that will enhance the quality of our commercial areas, and I will support residential developments that meet our standards. It is a great honor to serve the citizens and businesses of my hometown.
