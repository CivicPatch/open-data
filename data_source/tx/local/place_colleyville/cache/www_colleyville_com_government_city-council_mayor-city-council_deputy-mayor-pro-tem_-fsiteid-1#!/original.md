**Scotty Richardson, Deputy Mayor Pro Tem - Place 3![Councilmember Richardson](https://www.colleyville.com/home/showpublishedimage/2808/638205367301570000)**Term Expires: May 2026  
Email: [srichardson@colleyville.com](mailto:srichardson@colleyville.com)  
Address: Colleyville, Texas  
Phone: 817.676.2120  
Colleyville Resident Since: 2019

As a councilmember, I will strive to keep Colleyville unique. My goal for Colleyville is to preserve its rural character while enhancing our quality of life. I desire a standard of living that ensures our wellbeing, comfort, and enjoyment, while making sure that our public safety initiatives continue to safeguard us against risk, harm, and loss. My goal is to embrace all the wonderful things about Colleyville, to build on them, and to make them even better. I look forward to taking Colleyville to the next level.

**Family:**

I have been married for 48 years to my high school sweetheart, Jenny. We have two amazing daughters, Erin and Jenna. Jenna is married to our son-in-law, Bryan. Our favorite time is with our two grandsons, Connor and Owen.

**Occupation:**

I retired from Frito-Lay/PepsiCo after a 41-year career in research and development, where I was Director of Research for Analytical Sciences. I managed chemistry, physical testing, and forensic laboratories in North America, Europe, and Australia. In 2014, I was honored to receive an achievement award by the New York Academy of Sciences for an invention using laser technology for analytical measurements. I am a co-inventor on eight United States patents.

**Community Involvement:**

I love being retired. It gives me more time for family and community. Being involved in Colleyville has broadened my understanding of our city government and civic organizations. Below are the activities I have enjoyed participating in and supporting.
