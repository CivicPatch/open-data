City Council Place 5
====================



**Kimberly Holt Gunderson, Place 5
![Councilmember Gunderson](https://www.colleyville.com/home/showpublishedimage/3074/638520498429200000)**
Term Expires: May 2027
Email:
[kgunderson@colleyville.com](mailto:kgunderson@colleyville.com)
Address: Colleyville, Texas
Colleyville Resident Since: 1996

As a Councilmember, I believe the continued success of Colleyville will be the result of the diligent preservation of those unique qualities that define our City. Having lived here for almost three decades, I deeply value our status as one of Texas’s safest cities and our ability to blend suburban growth with small town ambiance. It’s a privilege to contribute to the community that I have always been proud to call home.

I am married to David Gunderson and we have three grown children. We share a home on an acre where we raise chickens and enjoy relaxing on the porch listening to our neighbor’s donkeys braying in the evening.
