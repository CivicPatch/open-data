**Bobby Lindamood, Mayor**
![Mayor Bobby Lindamood](https://www.colleyville.com/home/showpublishedimage/2693/638061081325670000)
Term Expires: May 2028

Colleyville Resident Since: 2010

First, I’d like to say, “I love Colleyville”. It’s a unique town with so many great assets across our beautiful city. I am a true Texan raised with old school "Honesty" ~ "Integrity" ~ Where your name means something, and a handshake is your bond. I have been married for 27 years to my wonderful wife Tami Lindamood, we also have 2 beautiful daughters who attend Tarleton University (Harper Lindamood) and CHHS (Reagan Lindamood). A true small business owner of JR's Demolition which has been in business for over 17 years and is ranked one of the top demolition businesses in the DFW Metroplex. Employing over 30 longtime team members. As in business and beyond, I believe in the concept that we work as a "Team" - City Hall and residents together as one unit.

I am proud to have been involved with keeping density low, eliminating the high tiered water rates, when taking office found 100% financial relief of $660,000 that was previously underpaid to our first responders, helped with budgeting our CIP (Which is fully funded for the next 5 years), AAA+ Rating, pay cash as we go. Also helped budget the “no new tax revenue” for the last 4 years, giving Colleyville residents financial relief as home values soar. I have prided myself by bringing a leadership style that has brought back the voice of the citizens to city hall once again. I also believe that the office of councilor, and the city itself, can and should be used to intervene to the benefit of the residents of our great city. With so many talents throughout the community of Colleyville, we have revitalized the full use of citizen involvement in committees.
