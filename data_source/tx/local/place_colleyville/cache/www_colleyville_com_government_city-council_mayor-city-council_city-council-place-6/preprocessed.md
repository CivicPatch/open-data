As a Councilmember, I will strive to make decisions which are in the best long-term interests of our City to maintain our fiscal conservatism, keep our housing density low, support our first responders, attract desirable commercial development, and maintain our hometown qualities. In making these decisions, transparency in our process and available information, along with citizen input will be crucial as we go forward.
