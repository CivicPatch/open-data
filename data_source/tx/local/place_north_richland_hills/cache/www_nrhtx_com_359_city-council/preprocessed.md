North Richland Hills operates under a council-manager form of government. The City Council is composed of a mayor and seven council members. The mayor and council members are elected at-large and serve three-year terms.
The City Charter provides for payment of $50 per meeting attended by elected officials. The City Council traditionally meets twice each month.
The council enacts local legislation, adopts the annual operating budget and sets policy. The city manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the city and reports directly to the council.

The City Council also serves as the Crime Control & Prevention District Board, the Sign Review Board and the Landscape Review Board. Council subcommittees include the Naming Board, and Capital Improvements Projects (CIP) Committee.
