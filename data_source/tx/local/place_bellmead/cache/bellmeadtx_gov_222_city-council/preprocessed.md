Incorporation and Early Governance (1954):
------------------------------------------

Bellmead, a community with a rich history, was officially incorporated in 1954. In its initial years, the city operated under a mayor-alderman government system.

*Candidates for Bellmead’s first municipal election posed for a photograph after the incorporation of the city in late 1952. Just over one year later, in 1954, citizens voted to reincorporate under a mayor-alderman system of government.*

On February 23, 1954, the Bellmead City Council, led by Mayor J.H. West and council members O.B. Lusk Jr., J. W. Bounds, Chas. V. Gee, John A. Hyden, and J.E. Scott, convened for a significant session that shaped the administrative landscape of the city.

The primary order of business was the appointment of a city secretary, F.C. Moses, through the first resolution of the day. Following this appointment, the council delved into various matters crucial to the city's functioning.

One key decision involved the compensation and provisions for the City Marshal. The council agreed that the City Marshal would be paid fifty dollars per week, and the city would supply essential equipment such as a badge, siren, gun, and red light. Mayor West took the responsibility of purchasing these items, with the understanding that the city would reimburse him, and these assets would become city property.

In terms of the City Marshal's responsibilities, it was decided that he would be responsible for providing his own car and covering associated expenses. The agreed-upon start date for the City Marshal's salary was March 3, 1954, contingent on the city acquiring the necessary funds.

Furthermore, Mayor West appointed Mr. Lusk and Mr. Bounds to a committee tasked with procuring essential supplies such as letterhead, receipts, forms, and other administrative necessities. The designated mailing address for these supplies was 2801 Parrish St., Bellmead, Texas.

This February 23, 1954, City Council meeting not only witnessed the establishment of key administrative roles and responsibilities but also demonstrated a commitment to the efficient functioning of Bellmead through the procurement of essential supplies and infrastructure.

Transition to Council-Manager Government (November 12, 1955):
-------------------------------------------------------------

A pivotal moment in Bellmead's governance occurred on November 12, 1955, when the electorate embraced a significant change. The City Charter was adopted, marking the establishment of a "council-manager government." This form of municipal governance aimed to enhance efficiency and professionalism in the administration of city affairs. The City Charter underwent its last update in 1961, solidifying the framework that guides Bellmead's governance.

City Council Responsibilities:
------------------------------

The City Council's responsibilities extend to the enactment of local legislation, setting city policies, and approving budgets that shape the community's development. Additionally, the council is involved in the crucial task of employing the City Manager, a key administrative figure responsible for the day-to-day operations of the city.

For transparency and civic engagement, the City of Bellmead adheres to the Open Meetings Act. This legislation ensures that official meetings are open to the public, allowing residents to witness and participate in the decision-making processes of the local government.  All council members are required by law to attend open meetings act training when elected and/or reelected.

City Secretary's Office:
------------------------

For those seeking more information or wishing to engage with the city's governance, the City Secretary's office serves as a valuable point of contact. Residents and stakeholders are encouraged to reach out for additional details or to address any inquiries related to Bellmead's governance.
