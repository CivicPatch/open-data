Are you a student interested in learning more about your community? Do you want to help shape the future of Cibolo? Join the Cibolo Youth Advisory Council (CYAC) and do more than just read about history…make it!
The purpose of the CYAC is to learn about local government and educate other youth on its functions.  It aims to involve students in municipal government and report to the Cibolo City Council, ensuring that youth perspectives are considered. This is an opportunity for students in grades 7-12 to engage with local government, develop leadership skills, and make a meaningful impact in our community. As a member, you’ll work alongside city officials, participate in council meetings, and represent the youth of Cibolo.

#### *Interested in becoming a member?*

Qualifications for Membership:

* Must be enrolled in grades 7-12 and must be under the age of 18 years
* Attend monthly meetings
* Routinely report CYAC activities to the Cibolo City Council so that it may consider the viewpoints of young adults in the community
