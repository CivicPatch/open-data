Katie Cunningham was elected to the Cibolo City Council, representing District 4, in November 2021.
![Katie Cunningham](https://www.cibolotx.gov/Government/Council/Katie%20Cunningham.jpg?t=202501161717100)
With extensive experience in nonprofit organizations and city government, Katie has cultivated a deep passion for community service and a people-first approach. She is actively engaged in her community, regularly participating in block walks, attending neighborhood and community meetings, communicating with constituents via calls and texts, conducting ride-alongs with city departments, organizing and contributing to community clean-up efforts, and collaborating with numerous outstanding organizations throughout the Cibolo area.
Katie is a strong advocate for strategic, innovative, and efficient fiscal management, as well as for transparency and open communication in all aspects of government.  She emphasizes the importance of thoughtful planning, diligent follow-through, and updating regulations and codes to align with the community’s vision for Cibolo’s future.  One of her most significant achievements on the Council has been the establishment of the Cibolo Youth Council.  This initiative empowers 16 youth (7th–12th grade) to develop strategies for engaging their peers and creating a welcoming and vibrant city for residents of all ages.

A lifelong resident of the area, Katie graduated from Samuel Clemens High School in 2004.  She went on to earn degrees in Public Relations and Speech Communication (with an emphasis on Corporate Communication) from Baylor University. After graduation, she met her husband and spent three years in Paris, Texas, before returning to Cibolo.  Together, they are raising their four children (ages 20, 13, 9, and 8) and feel fortunate to call such an amazing city home.
