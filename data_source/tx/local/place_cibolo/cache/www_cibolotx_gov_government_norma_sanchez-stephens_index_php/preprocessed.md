Norma Sanchez-Stephens is a native Texan and a longtime resident of our Texas Tri-County area. She graduated locally from Judson High School and earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Banking and Finance from the University of Incarnate Word in San Antonio, TX. She established a successful career in the mortgage industry for 10 years. She resigned as a Mortgage Loan Officer to stay home and care for her family when her husband was deployed to Iraq with the Army National Guard. Having the desire to remain active, Mrs. Sanchez-Stephens volunteered to serve as a leader for her husband’s National Guard Unit’s Family Readiness Group to assist fellow Service Member’s families during deployment. She secured her Group Fitness Instructor certification and has served part-time at the Schertz YMCA since its opening in 2010, forging lasting bonds with Schertz and Cibolo residents that continue through today. Mrs. Sanchez-Stephens officially moved to Cibolo in 2018 as their family’s ideal community environment to raise their family. She and her husband, Michael, have been married 24 years, have 5 children (9, 11, 16, 17, and 18), and enjoy spending time with parents and siblings residing in the San Antonio area. Their family also enjoys being active within their church, community outreach, and volunteer opportunities. Mrs. Sanchez-Stephens is honored to represent At-Large Place 5 and the City of Cibolo and looks forward to serving Cibolo residents and the bright future that lies ahead.
