**A Message from the Mayor**

There are so many exciting things happening in Marble Falls. The quality of life in Marble Falls makes Marble Falls a very desirable place to live, work, and visit. Our many parks, Lake Marble Falls, the Main Street Downtown District, and our schools are just a few reasons why many people choose to raise their families here and call Marble Falls home.

As Marble Falls is being discovered by many, our City Development Services department is very busy working on many potential commercial and residential developments. With growth comes the need to continually add to and upgrade the basic services we provide for the health and safety of our citizens and visitors. This includes streets, water, and wastewater services, as well as police and fire services. For example, we have begun construction on a new wastewater treatment plant, One Water, that will make Marble Falls a leader in water conservation and reuse, allowing us to thrive in a time when water is becoming more scarce and more valuable every day. Our goal is to welcome growth while preserving the small-town charm that Marble Falls has always been known for.

Lake Marble Falls is one of our most valuable assets. The Marble Falls Hotel and Conference Center is currently under construction to connect Main Street to Lake Marble Falls, which will continue to attract many visitors to stay overnight, enjoy the parks, and experience the dining and shopping options we have to offer. The Marble Falls Economic Development Corporation continues to contribute to the development of additional lakefront park space. It is currently enhancing the existing parks with a new pedestrian bridge to connect Johnson Park and Lakeside Park.

With growth comes many challenges, but the City of Marble Falls has a great group of dedicated employees and councilmembers who are committed to serving our residents and visitors every day.

With all we have to offer, the future is bright and exciting for Marble Falls.

Thank you for the privilege of serving as your Mayor.

John Packer  
Mayor, City of Marble Falls
