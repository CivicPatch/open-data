Title: District Two
  
[jnorman@midlandtexas.gov](mailto:jnorman@midlandtexas.gov)

  
  

![](https://www.midlandtexas.gov/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=7233)Born and raised in Midland, John Norman attended Pease Elementary, Goddard Jr High, and graduated from Midland Lee High School. John was a three-sport athlete where he lettered in Football, Basketball and Track earning him honors as a two-time All-State Player and the first Parade All-American in football, from the Permian Basin, featured in ESPN the magazine. After graduating from High School and being recruited by virtually every D1 school in the country, John chose to play at Texas Tech University under the late Spike Dykes & Mike Leach. A successful football career as a letterman at Tech, John earned the opportunity to attend Philadelphia Eagles training camp. After ending his career in professional football, John knew his heart would lead him to a position of working with the youth. Coaching at the collegiate level, and at several football camps across Texas and Oklahoma, John knew he had found his calling. John and his brother Josh founded Norman Elite, an athletic training organization that trains kids ages 8-18 with a focus on mentorship and character development. They provide 1-on-1 Training, and Group Training Sessions. Under John's leadership, Norman Elite was also a winner of Midland's Entrepreneurial Challenge for its innovative approach to character development through athletic training and coaching. The company currently teaches its "Character Development" curriculum to over 100 students in Midland schools. In 2019, John made an exciting decision to run for City Council, in his hometown of Midland. He won the special election by a large margin. In November of 2021 John was re-elected to serve a full 3 year term as City Councilman District 2. John is passionate about serving the District 2 community, and the city of Midland. John and wife Denise have two sons, John Il and Braylen.
