![](https://www.midlandtexas.gov/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=9655)Brian Stubbs was raised in Roswell and earned a degree in Mechanical Engineering from New Mexico State University. After college, Brian worked for Cummins Engine Company in Clovis, NM.

Brian moved to Southern Indiana with Cummins to pursue his passion for engine design and development. While working for Cummins, Brian enjoyed the positions of Development engineer, Design Engineer, Air Handling Team Leaders, Special Project Integrators, Aftertreatment Diagnostics Leader, and Six Sigma Black Belt.

After a great career with Cummins, Brian moved to Chandler, AZ to work for a start-up company developing new engine technologies and products. Brian led teams to develop testing, field testing, performance, emissions, compliance, service, and diagnostics as a Director of Engineering.

ACS has grown from 14 employees to almost 100 in 2024. The company continues to plan to grow through their dedication to quality products and customer service.

Brian continues to follow his second passion of improving education quality for all children and serving his community.  Brian was active and later elected to a school board while living in Indiana where he was able to see the struggles, difficult situations, and great people trying to help in our schools. He continues this passion by servicing on the Midland Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors (Treasure), Educational Partnership of the Permian Basin (Treasure), Communities in Schools board (Vice President), Education Foundation of Midland (President), Midland-Odessa Urban Transit District and BSA scout master.
