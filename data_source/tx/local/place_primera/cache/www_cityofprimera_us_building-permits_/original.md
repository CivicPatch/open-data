The Building Inspections Division is dedicated to the enforcement of the community's standards for safety, health, and durability of buildings constructed, altered, or maintained within the City. The Division enforces these standards through a program of providing information to the public, and through plans examination and on-site inspections by specially qualified personnel.

### Permits

Our team can assist homeowners and licensed contractors obtain the proper permits for their project. If your property is within the City of Primera and you are erecting, constructing, enlarging, altering, repairing, improving, removing, converting, moving, demolishing any building or structure or a portion within the structure, you are required to obtain City of Primera permits. Specific examples of when permits are required are room additions, walls, carports, decks, patios, in-ground & above-ground swimming pools, fences, re-roofs, and general repairs to include siding, doors, and windows. For all projects proposing additional square footage, a site plan (showing entire lot, existing residence on lot, proposed construction, and distances to all property lines), an estimated construction value (to include cost of materials and labor), and an Energy Report (total number of windows and sizes, doors, and walls) will be required. Permits for new home construction, additions, structural work on existing homes and new accessory dwellings can only be issued to the homeowner or contractor. It is important to get these permits so City inspectors can verify the work was done correctly in order to protect you, your family, and your guests. In addition, if you are found working without the required permit, you will be fined and required to purchase a permit at twice the cost.

### Codes
