City Council
============

The City of Liberty is a Home Rule City, which operates under a Council/Manager form of government. Under this government the elected City Council sets the policies for the operation of the municipal government, while the administrative responsibilities of the City rests with the City Manager. The Council appoints the City Manager. The City Council consists of seven members; a Mayor and six Council Members. The term of office for these elected officials is for a period of two years. All members are elected at-large.
