The City of Commerce is a Home Rule municipality with a council-manager form of government. The City Council is made up of a mayor and four council members with one member designated as Mayor Pro Tem. All members of the Council are elected at-large and serve three-year staggered terms. They are community volunteers who meet in regular meetings once a month.

The role of the Mayor and City Council is to enact local legislation, provide vision for the future of the City of Commerce, set policy, adopt the annual budget and ordinances, resolutions and policies relating to public health, safety and welfare.

The public is invited to attend all City Council meetings on  the third Tuesday of each month at 6:00 p.m. in the City Council Chamber at City Hall, 1119 Alamo Street. Council meetings are also streamed on our YouTube channel.
