Dr. Brooks Williams
-------------------

### Chief Executive Officer (City Manager)

Brooks Williams has served as the City Manager of Ferris, Texas, since October 2019, bringing nearly two decades of management experience in both the public and private sectors. Under his leadership, Ferris has experienced a transformational period of growth and innovation. Employee turnover, which once plagued the city, has significantly improved, with the average employee tenure increasing from just three months to now over five years. Ferris has also achieved financial stability, eliminating budget deficits, quadrupling the fund balance, and earning nearly perfect audits for three consecutive years. These achievements contributed to the city’s bond rating being upgraded to AA-, a first in 15 years, positioning Ferris for sustained financial health.

Brooks has overseen the largest economic expansion in Ferris’s 150-year history, with rising home prices and significant development. His focus on strategic planning and comprehensive initiatives has strengthened the quality of life and economic vitality in the city. Notably, Brooks is now the longest-serving City Manager in the city’s 150 years, a testament to the stability, trust, and progress he has brought to the community.

In addition to his role as City Manager, Brooks was tapped in August 2024 to lead the Quality Texas Foundation Regional Program. This nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization helps schools, government agencies, nonprofits, businesses, and hospitals improve performance through education, training, assessment, and feedback rooted in the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence. The program, which originated as a concept introduced by Governor Ann Richards in the early 1990s, supports the national Malcolm Baldrige program through cooperative efforts involving the Governor’s Office, the Texas Department of Commerce, and Texas businesses. Under Brooks’s leadership, the foundation continues to drive efficiency and effectiveness across a wide range of sectors.

Previously, Brooks served as Chief Quality Officer for the Hurst-Euless-Bedford Independent School District, where his efforts led the district to be recognized as the top-performing district in Texas for both financial and academic performance. His leadership in system-wide improvements set a benchmark for excellence in public education. By integrating innovative strategies and fostering a culture of accountability, Brooks played a key role in achieving outstanding results that benefited students, staff, and the community at large. His tenure at HEB ISD remains a testament to his ability to deliver measurable success in complex organizations.

Brooks is also the author of Rising to Serve: Reimagining Public Administration for a New Era, a book published in 2024 that explores innovative approaches to leadership and public administration. The book highlights his commitment to advancing the profession and offers actionable insights for leaders across all sectors.
