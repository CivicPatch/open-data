Building Inspections

You must get a Building Permit from City Hall before any construction begins.

The office needs 2 sets of plans. A $75 plan review fee will be added to your permit fee = total cost.  
  
Building permits are good for six months.  Builders need to be sure and call in for a final inspection within the six month period or additional fees related to an extension will apply.  
  
Form board surveys must be submitted prior to a plumbing rough inspection.  
  
You must get a building permit if you are building in the town limits or the extra territorial jurisdiction ("ETJ") of a subdivision.  If you are unsure, please call and we will gladly verify the address.

All subcontractors must register annually with City Hall for a nominal fee.
