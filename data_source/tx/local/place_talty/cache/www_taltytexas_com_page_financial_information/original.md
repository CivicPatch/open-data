The final FY 2026 budget will be adopted on September 16.

The significant increase from last year is due to the potential for sealing and seal coating city roads. This is recommended to preserve the major renovation work completed several years ago on CR 213, CR 216/Bunny Run, George Trail, Douglas Circle and CR 215/Michael Talty Avenue. It also anticipates similar crack repair and seal coating on CR 213A. Our engineer's estimate is the basis for the $640,000 line item in Capital Outlay.
