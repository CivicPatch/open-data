Born and raised in Kilgore, Victor Boyd graduated from Kilgore High School in 1983, before pursuing and completing a career in the United States Navy, where he served for more than nine years.

Reaching the rank of E5 (Petty Officer, Second Class), Boyd's Navy career enabled him to travel and live in other states before returning home to Kilgore 21 years later to begin employment with the Martin Companies. After 11 years in that position, Boyd currently holds the title of primary dispatcher.

He is an active member of the Lions Club and currently serves as vice president of the board of the Rusk County Boys and Girls Club - Kilgore Unit. He also is a member of the Kilgore Chamber of Commerce and is a proud co-founder of the Kilgore Legacy Foundation. A former tee-ball coach, Boyd works with the Kilgore Education Foundation, through which he participates in a weekly literacy program, mentoring a local third-grade student. Mr. Boyd is a member of Union Church of Christ in Easton, Texas.
