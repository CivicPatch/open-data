Mayor’s Message:
================

Welcome to Hidalgo!

When I first took office as mayor, I made a promise to elevate our community, our home, to its fullest potential. I outlined a bold agenda to move our city forward. I’ve been honored to work alongside Hidalgo’s City Council and Hidalgo leadership to guide hidalgo to be a thriving city.   
  
Quality of life is at the forefront with everything we do, and we have made tremendous progress. Hidalgo has the industry and the location. Multi-national corporations have found out how good it is to do business in Hidalgo. More than a million people live and work within a 15-mile radius of the city. The McAllen-Hidalgo International Bridge is one with the most pedestrians and vehicle flow in the State of Texas. On a monthly basis about half a million pedestrians and vehicles cross this bridge making it the heartbeat of our community.   
  
Hidalgo has welcomed family owned and international businesses. Our business growth has placed Hidalgo as a premier place to do business. With an influx of the small business community, developers are finding that Hidalgo is the place to build. Our Historic area “The District” is home to more than 100-year-old historical buildings. It has shown continued growth by adding several new businesses this past year. We continue to focus on making the Historic area a tourist attraction for the State of Texas.   
  
Hidalgo is the host to famous award-winning festivals. We celebrate the month-long Festival of Lights every December showcasing the Largest Christmas Display in Texas and Borderfest one of the biggest cultural music festivals every first weekend of March. Hidalgo is proud of being home to the stars of entertainment, the legendary Payne Arena. This arena has hosted the top talents in the world and is consistently ranked by Pollstar as one of the top 100 busiest arenas in the world.  
  
Hidalgo has gems throughout the city that makes us known as the entertainment capital of the Rio Grande Valley. There is no doubt Hidalgo is a city like no other. I want to express my gratitude and appreciation for this opportunity to be able to promote, nurture and build this great city. Not just for those of us who live here now, but for the generations have come before us, and most importantly those that will follow us.
