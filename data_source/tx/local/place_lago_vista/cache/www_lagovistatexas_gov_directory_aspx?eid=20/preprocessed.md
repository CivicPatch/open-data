I am committed to ensuring we focus on expanding our drinking and wastewater infrastructure before capacity issues leave our citizens without an essential service. Together, we need to ensure it is done the right way and that our water infrastructure is properly maintained for decades to come. Additionally, we need to work on improving our roads by creating a consistent plan to fund and complete work on many roads that have been neglected for years. We also need to create a business-friendly environment to help support the growth and prosperity of our local businesses. All of this can only be done with your input and support. So please
