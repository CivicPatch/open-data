**About**

Shane is a proven and career-long public servant who brings a wealth of experience to his role as a member of the Lago Vista City Council. He has more than a decade of local, State and federal government experience working for the Governor of Texas, in the Texas Senate, the Texas House of Representatives, the Texas Veterans Commission and the U.S Treasury Department. Currently, he directs nationwide government affairs and regulatory efforts for a fantasy sports company. 

While working for the Governor, Shane managed the Texas Enterprise Fund, a $100+ million grant program which helped attract/retain businesses committed to creating over 11,000 jobs and spending more than $4.3B in Texas. Shane began his career in the Texas Legislature as an intern and worked his way up to a Chief of Staff in the Texas House of Representatives and a Senior Advisor in the Texas Senate. He has helped draft, pass and implement dozens of bills that are now laws in Texas. In addition to his government work, Shane founded ATX Plays, a sports and social league used to raise awareness for more than 25 nonprofits in Austin and voted 2016's "Most Uniquely Austin Business" at the Greater Austin Business Awards.

Furthermore, Shane is heavily involved in his community. Shane was appointed to the City of Lago Vista's Economic Development Advisory Committee prior to joining Council, he serves as a Vice President on the Board of Directors at the Island on Lake Travis and serves in the Lion’s Club. Shane was previously appointed to the City of Austin's Resources Management Commission in 2016, he has volunteered as a Court Appointed Special Advocate in Travis County, worked on the Austin Young Chamber's Leadership Services Committee, the Arc of Texas and worked as a voter registrar.

**Council Goals**

I am committed to ensuring we focus on expanding our drinking and wastewater infrastructure before capacity issues leave our citizens without an essential service. Together, we need to ensure it is done the right way and that our water infrastructure is properly maintained for decades to come. Additionally, we need to work on improving our roads by creating a consistent plan to fund and complete work on many roads that have been neglected for years. We also need to create a business-friendly environment to help support the growth and prosperity of our local businesses. All of this can only be done with your input and support. So please [email me](mailto:shane.saum@lagovistatexas.gov) and let me know what issues are most important to you.
