Kevin Sullivan
==============

[City Council](https://www.lagovistatexas.gov/Directory.aspx?DID=19)
Title: Mayor
[Email Mayor Sullivan](mailto:Mayor@lagovistatexas.gov)

Term Expires: November 2025

I am a life-long Texan having grown up in the Dallas area and migrated to the Austin area to attend UT in 1981. My educational background includes a BBA in Finance from UT Austin and an MBA from SMU. I have two children, both of whom attended the Lago Vista schools and have now graduated from UT Austin and Texas State. I've visited the Lago Vista area for the lake and golf since the early 1990's and have been a permanent resident since 2006.

For 25+ years, I worked in the software professional services area as a software developer, manager, and salesperson. My experience as a software developer or manager of developers spanned from internet startups to global Fortune 50 companies and encompassed typical business systems to graphical information systems and web-based commerce. For the last 11 years, I've also been a part time real estate agent and earned my broker's license in 2018. I've made the transition from my technology-based career to semi-retirement and part time real estate broker.

During my time in Lago Vista, I've participated in the leadership of a variety of organizations. I've been a coach for both the LV Dribblers and the LV Little League. I served as the chairperson of the board that governs Lago Vista Aquatics for multiple years. For six years, I served in a variety of roles for local Boy Scout Troop 198 including Assistant Scout Master, Treasurer, and Chairperson of the council that governs the troop. For the LVPOA, I've served as a member of both the nominating and the facilities committees. I've coordinated the altar servers for St Mary's Catholic Church for six years and volunteered as a lector and eucharistic minister. Over the years, I've helped run charity golf tournaments and wood sales that raised over $45,000 for Boy Scout Troop 198, LVHS Class of 2015 and 2016, and the LVHS football team. In 2018, I joined the local Lions club and have enjoyed helping in a variety of their fundraisers and stepped up to fill the Marketing director role. For the city, I served as the Chairman of the Golf Advisory Committee in 2015 and previously served on the City Council in Place 2 from June of 2016 to November of 2018. During that tenure, I served as liaison to the Parks and Rec Advisory Committee, the Library Advisory Committee, and the Airport Advisory Committee.

My main goals while serving on council are threefold. First, I focus on making sure our tax dollars are being used in a fiscally responsible manner with spending focused on essential infrastructure (water, wastewater, and roads). Second, I work to ensure that Lago Vista grows in an intelligent, organized way through strategic economic development. Third, I strive to make sure the priorities of the city adjust as the demographics of our city change with population growth. While these are the goals I stated while campaigning and are the priorities I focus on, I always encourage citizens to reach out and express to me their priorities so I can make sure those priorities are addressed as well. With that in mind, please feel free to email me and let me know what is on your mind and how I can help serve you.
