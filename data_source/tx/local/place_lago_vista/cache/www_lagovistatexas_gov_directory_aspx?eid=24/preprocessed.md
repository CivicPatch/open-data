Paul Roberts, a proud fourth generation Texan, was born and raised in San Antonio. He made his way to Austin in 1998 when he accepted a sales job at Dell. He subsequently went to work at Velocity Electronics where he learned his trade of brokering electronic components. Always having an entrepreneurial spirit, in 2005 Paul decided to begin working for his own dreams and created Solid Technology Solutions, Inc., a successful global distributor of electronic components. Paul continues to own and operate Solid Technology Solutions, Inc.

Paul and his wife, Deanna, and their three young children moved to Lago Vista in 2016. It was important to Paul and his wife to raise their children in a smaller town more conducive to better child rearing where they could know their neighbors and enjoy the outdoors.

Paul has always the embraced the idea that you must speak up and get involved to affect change. To that end, for the past several years Paul has been involved in local government. As a citizen, Paul was a regular at City Council, committee, and commission meetings beginning in 2019. In late 2020, he was chosen to fill a temporary vacancy on the City Council. Paul also served on numerous committees. To highlight, Paul served as Chair of the Economic Advisory Committee, a member of the 2021 Charter Review Committee, and a member of the Building and Standards Commission. In 2021, Paul was honored to be elected to serve on the City Council, Place 5.

Paul's other civic activities include being a member of the Knights of Columbus and the Lions Club. But his favorite role is "dad" to three school-aged children. He feels passionate about keeping Lago Vista safe, conserving green space, and being thorough and thoughtful in planning for the future growth of Lago Vista.
