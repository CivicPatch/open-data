Paul Prince
===========

[City Council](https://www.lagovistatexas.gov/Directory.aspx?DID=19)
Title: Member, Place 6
[Email Paul Prince](mailto:councilplace6@lagovistatexas.gov)

Term Expires: November 2024

I'm a Christian and a family man. Mira and I met while we were students at Abilene Christian University and have been married since 1982. We have two sons who both live in the Austin area. I am a retired computer engineer with extensive experience managing large budgets. I like to research and understand facts. My mind can be changed based on fair and respectful argument.

I'm an active LV resident and property owner. We've owned a home here since 2004, transitioning from "weekenders" to full-time residents a number of years ago. As full-time residents, we've jumped into the community wholeheartedly. We are members at Rolling Hills Community Church, where I serve on the board as Outreach Director. We participate in the Hill Country Singers, and we operate the local small business Cordovan Art School. I have served on several City Committees and Commissions, most recently serving on both the "Planning and Zoning Commission" and the "Building and Standards Commission".

Thank you for entrusting me to represent you in City Council. I welcome your input and feedback. Let's keep the best of our vibrant and beautiful city, as we grow to the future.
