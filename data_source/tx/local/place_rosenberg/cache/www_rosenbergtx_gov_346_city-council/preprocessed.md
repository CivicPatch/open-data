The City of Rosenberg operates in a Council-Manager form of government in which the City Council sets the policy and overall direction for the City, and appoints a professional City Manager and other key officials to oversee the City's daily operations.

The City of Rosenberg's City Council is the legislative body; its members are the community's decision-makers. Power is centralized in the elected council. It approves the budget and determines the tax rate, and it also focuses on the community's goals, major projects, and long-term considerations such as community growth, land use development, capital improvements, capital financing, and strategic planning, rather than administrative details. City Council hires a professional manager to carry out the administrative responsibilities and supervises the manager's performance.

The council-manager form of local government combines the strong political leadership of elected officials in the form of a council or other governing body, with the strong managerial experience of an appointed local government manager. This plan establishes a representative system where power is concentrated in the elected council as a whole and where the council hires a professionally trained manager to oversee the delivery of public services.

Time is allotted at the beginning of each item on the council agenda for residents, staff, and other interested persons to address the Council regarding agenda items.
A Public Participation Form
must be presented to the City Secretary prior to the time that the meeting is called to order.  Time is also allotted at each regular meeting for persons wishing to address the Council on non-agenda items or other issues.  Speakers are asked to step to the podium as soon as they are recognized by the Mayor, and state one's name and address before beginning their presentation. To save time, and allow everyone desiring so to speak, debate or discussion with Council regarding a presented item is not allowed; however, your comments may be included as part of the official minutes of the Council Meeting.
