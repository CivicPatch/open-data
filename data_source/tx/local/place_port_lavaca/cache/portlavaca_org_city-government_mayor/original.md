Mayor Jack Whitlow
------------------

**Current Term:** May 2024-2026

### Message From The Mayor

Port Lavaca is the greatest little city on the Texas coast, with the most welcoming people in the state. We take great pride in our diverse cultures, beautiful coastline and growing businesses. Our city’s location in the middle of the Texas coastline gives us easy access to all major cities in the state. We enjoy a very comfortable way of life.

Port Lavaca’s rich history began in the 1840’s just after the Great Comanche Raid destroyed the port of Linnville. The city grew fast and the pride of it’s citizens was evident during the Civil War in their defense of the city from the Union army. We are planning a great 150th anniversary celebration of the Battle of Port Lavaca which should be both fun and educational. Port Lavaca has a Christmas parade during our “Festival of Lights” celebration the first week of December. It is this small town lifestyle that makes it difficult not to be involved. We have opportunities for involvement for everyone, whether you are interested in being part of a single event, or and on going festival committee.

We have worked hard to make Port Lavaca a place in which everyone would be proud to say its name. The easy going pace makes it the best place in our state to live, work and play. Whether you make our town your home or just come to visit, we offer the best in fishing, boating, birding, hunting, eating or just plain relaxing.

Come see us, we would love to have you visit us in “Paradise on the Bay”.
