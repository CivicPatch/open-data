Form of Government
------------------

West University Place operates under the Council-Manager form of government.

* Establishes policies

The City Council appoints the following:

* City Attorney
* City Manager

### True Citizen Legislators

The City Council consists of a Mayor and 4 Council members who are among the few true citizen legislators still serving at various levels of government in Texas. They are elected on a non-partisan basis in a city-wide election held on the 1st Saturday in May of every odd-numbered year. City Council members are elected as representatives from the city at large and may serve no more than 3 successive terms.

### City Council Meetings

City Council meetings are held at the Municipal Building, 3800 University Boulevard, on the 2nd and 4th Mondays of each month at 6:30 p.m. All meetings are open to the public with agendas posted in advance at the Municipal Building and on the website. Citizens who wish to speak before regular City Council meetings may sign-in just before the meeting.

In addition to the regularly scheduled meetings, special meetings may be held after proper notices are posted and publicized. For agendas and more information about City Council meetings, call the City Secretary at 713.662.5813 or visit [meetings and agendas](https://westutx.gov/AgendaCenter/City-Council-2) section of this website.

City Manager
------------

The City Council appoints a [City Manager](https://westutx.gov/148/City-Managers-Office) who is the chief administrative officer and is responsible for the efficient and economical operation of the city. The City Manager is chosen by the City Council on the basis of executive and administrative training, education, experience and ability. Inquiries or complaints about city services should be directed to the office of the City Manager.
