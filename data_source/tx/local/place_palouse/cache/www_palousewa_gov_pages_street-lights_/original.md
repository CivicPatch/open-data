Street Lights
=============

**LED Street Lighting Pilot Program**

[Read the announcement from Mayor Echanove and Avista!](http://www.palousewa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/led-project_announcement.pdf)

**The City of Palouse** has recently found a most excellent opportunity to upgrade our local lighting system with state-of-the-art LED street lights. The best part of this program is that it won’t cost the City a penny. More likely, it will save us a good deal of money in our annual electrical bill, due the the heightened efficiency of LED lighting.

**Paul Kimmel**, representing **Avista Utilities**, presented the following background letter to the Palouse City Council on October 22, 2013:

* [City of Palouse / Avista Utilities LED Street Lighting Pilot Program](http://www.palousewa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/led-project.pdf)

**Mr. Kimmel also let us know** that the first three LED street lights had been installed, to test the quality of some of the LED vendors’ lights. Citizens are encouraged to review the three locations listed below, and can send comments on the project to [cityclerk@palouse.com](mailto:cityclerk@palouse.com).

**LED lights are installed at these intersections:**

* Church Street & Bridge Street
* Church Street & Beach Street
* Church Street & K Street
