Applying for membership to the Gatesville Fire Department
=========================================================

**Joining the Gatesville Volunteer Fire Department**

The Gatesville Volunteer Fire Department is one of the most progressive volunteer fire departments in the State of Texas, and we are always looking for quality people to join our ranks! The members of our department and our town's government officials are committed to providing the best possible Fire protection to the citizens of our town and surrounding areas of Coryell County. The GFD is comprised of 28 members trained in fire suppression, rescue operations, and basic first aid. Many of our members are also trained as Emergency Medical Technician's (EMT's), and Paramedics (EMT-P's). This enables us to provide excellent fire protection and medical care during all responses.

Committed members of our Firefighting Team are always needed. If you are interested in joining the Gatesville Fire Department, come by one of our training sessions at the fire station and pickup an application or [fill out our online application](https://www.gatesvilletx.com/fire/webform/how-join-gvfd). By coming to a training session, you will gain an insight into the department, see how our training activities are conducted, and you will meet our firefighters in person and be able to ask any questions you may have. This is the best way for you to see if a membership with the Gatesville FD is right for you.

We have excellent equipment with the newest technology for fire service. This includes the latest bunker gear, wild-land firefighting gear, SCBA (self-contained breathing apparatus) manufactured by MSA, Thermal Imaging Cameras, and more. Because of the commitment of our members and the support of our town's government and residents, we have grown to be a truly professional fire department. With this continued support, and the addition of new members dedicated to moving us forward, we will continue to grow and improve in the years to come.

We hold training sessions every Tuesday at 6:00 PM and special training drills on other dates and times.

After completing an application, bring it by the station and give it to one of our members. You will be asked to meet with a board comprised of our chief officers. A background check on the applicant is also conducted during this time. The process of approval by the board will normally follow the results of the background check. Once approved, the new member will be assigned all equipment at no charge and training will begin as a probationary firefighter. If you are interested in an exciting and rewarding experience serving your community, and you would like to be part of a professional, goal-oriented, and well trained fire department, we hope to hear from you! We can use your help!
