The City of Gatesville offers several ways for residents to be involved through volunteer organizations and City Boards and Commissions.

**Keep Gatesville Beautiful**
is a volunteer board that directs the efforts of community members to clean up and beautify our city. Board members attend quarterly meetings (usually held after 5pm), assist with events, and may chair or work on a subcommittee. Non-board volunteers may help on a committee or participate in events.  You do not need to be on the KGB Board to participate in our cleanup, education, and outreach events. Contact Keep Gatesville Beautiful by email at
[keepgatesvillebeautiful@gmail.com](mailto:keepgatesvillebeautiful@gmail.com?subject=I%20want%20to%20volunteer)
.

The Friends of the Gatesville Public Library was formed in 1961 by a group of citizens who believed " A good public library is important to the growth and development of a community."  That belief still continues and the Friends still support their library today.

Come and join this group of business people, educators, homemakers, students, retirees, all members of the community who want to help make our community a better place to live by providing access to a first-rate library that can continue to be recognized as an outstanding facility in the state. The Friends of the Library has 501c3 status, so all of your donations are tax exempt. Download a membership form at:

If you have an interest in serving, email the

acts as an advisory body on all planning and zoning matters.  The Commission consists of seven members, appointed by Council, serving two-year terms. The Commission’s responsibilities include the establishment of procedures for adopting and enforcing land regulations and boundaries of zoning districts and submitting reports to the governing body with its recommendations on any amendments to land regulations or district boundaries.  Additionally, the Planning and Zoning Commission is charged with the responsibility and authority to review complete subdivision applications and forward recommendation to the City Council as described by the adopted codes of the City and all State regulations. The Planning and Zoning Commission typically hosts regular meetings on the first Monday of each month at 5:30 p.m., as needed.
