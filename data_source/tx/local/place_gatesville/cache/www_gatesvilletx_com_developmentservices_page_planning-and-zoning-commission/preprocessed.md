The Planning and Zoning Commission is authorized by virtue of the subject of Section 8.03 of the City Charter to act as an advisory body on all planning and zoning matters.
The Commission shall consist of seven members, appointed by Council, for two-year terms each. The Council shall consider for appointment to the Commission only those persons who have demonstrated their civic interest, general knowledge of the community, independent judgment, interest in planning and zoning, and ability to prepare for and attend meetings. It is the intent of Council, that members shall, by reason of diversity of their individual occupations, constitute a Commission that is broadly representative of the community.

Members shall be appointed and approved by the City Council by Resolution.

* Members shall have the following qualifications:
  + ETJ citizen or individual who lives  within three (3) miles of the city limits and owns property within the city limits, and;
  + Not indebted to the City of Gatesville.
* Four (4) members are required to live within the city limits, allowing up to three (3) members to reside within the ETJ or within three (3) miles of the city limits.

Members of the Commission shall serve for a two (2) year term. Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired terms, but no member shall be appointed for a single term in excess of two (2) years. Members of the Commission shall serve without compensation, except for reimbursement for authorized expenditures attendant to the performance of their duties. The members of the Commission shall be identified by place numbers one (1) through seven (7). The terms of four (4) of the members (Places 1, 3, 5, and 7) shall begin on May first of each odd-numbered year and expire on April 30th two years thereafter and the terms of three of the members (Places 2, 4, and 6) shall begin on May first of each even-numbered year and shall expire on April 30th two years thereafter. Newly appointed members shall be installed at the first regular Commission meeting after their appointment. Members who miss three meetings within a six-month period may be replaced upon the recommendation of the Commission and the approval of the City Council.

The Commission's responsibilities include the establishment of procedures for adopting and enforcing land regulations and boundaries of zoning districts and submitting reports to the governing body with its recommendations on any amendments to land regulations or district boundaries.  Additionally, the Planning and Zoning Commission is charged with the responsibility and authority to review plats, zoning request changes, variances,  and specific use permits, and  forward recommendation to the City Council as described by the adopted codes of the City and all State regulations.

The Planning and Zoning Commission typically hosts regular meetings on the first Monday of each month, as needed.  Some meetings may be scheduled on different dates to accommodate federal holidays.  Regular meetings are hosted in person at the City Hall Council Chambers located at 110 N 8th Street, Gatesville TX 76528.  The designation for if a given meeting will be hosted in person shall be posted on the particular agenda for that meeting which shall be posted both online and at the bulletin board located outside City Hall's 8th Street entrance.  All regular meetings are open to the public.
