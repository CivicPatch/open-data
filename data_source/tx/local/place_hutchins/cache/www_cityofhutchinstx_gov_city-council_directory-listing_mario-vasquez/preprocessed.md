Mario Vasquez grew up in Oak Cliff and attended DISD schools. After graduating from South Oak Cliff High School, he attended El Centro Junior College. He’s been married to his wife, Cheryl, for 42 years. Together they have two children and four grandchildren.

He worked for over 40 years in the grocery business, including four years as a sales manager at Cacique USA, and the rest as the owner and operator of Vasquez Distribution where he had several employees working for him. He is now an Account Executive for Spectrum Charter.

Mayor Vasquez has lived in Hutchins since 1981. He served on the Planning and Zoning Commission and was first elected to the City Council in 2000. He served for 14 years as a Councilmember and is going on his 10
year as Mayor. Mayor Vasquez entered local government because he saw the need for minority representation. He was the first male Hispanic Councilmember and Mayor to serve Hutchins. He says, “I enjoy working with my fellow Council Members as we make an excellent team working towards the same goals. I love what we’ve been able to accomplish. I look forward to continuing working in the public sector, bringing new amenities to the City, and making Hutchins a better place to live.”
