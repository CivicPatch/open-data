Steve Nichols became involved in politics to better the living conditions and reputation of the City of Hutchins. He strives to improve all facets of the City from the parks, streets, and sidewalks to the police and fire departments – all while keeping the small-town feel. He is extremely proud to live in Hutchins, especially due to the comforting feeling of safety felt within the community. Having been on the City Council since 2014, Steve continues to work hard for the residents of Hutchins to make it an even better place to raise a family.

Originally from Dallas, Steve was raised in the Oak Cliff area before relocating to Hutchins in 1976. His grandparents and great grandparents settled in Hutchins over a century ago in the early 1900s. He has been married to his wife, Dena Nichols, for 37 years. Dena is a lifelong resident of Hutchins, and her parents and grandparents also resided in Hutchins for many decades. They have four children, who attended WHISD until it was disbanded by the state in 2005, and two grandchildren.

Steve graduated from Bryan Adams High school in 1980. He became a master plumber, and has been in the plumbing industry for 41 years. He was a Volunteer Firefighter/EMT for the Hutchins Fire Department for many years. Dena was also active in the Hutchins Fire Department for many years as a Firefighter/Paramedic, and has since retired from service. Steve currently serves as the Deacon for the First Baptist Church in Hutchins, the Vice President of the Hutchins Economic Development Corporation (EDC), and president of the Hutchins Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone (TIRZ) Board.
