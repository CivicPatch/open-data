About

Springtown is where ideas begin that set trends for other small cities.

The City of Springtown fosters a community spirit that make it the best place to live, work, and play in Parker County.

Springtown is home to a 33-acre park with amenities such as soccer and baseball fields, sand volleyball courts and disc golf. There is also a walking/jogging trail that winds through the park and passes by an area of creek bed which hosts a newly discovered set of dinosaur tracks. We also offer library services both locally and county wide through a mutual book-sharing program.

Many civic organizations are available in Springtown such as the Lions’ Club. There are also numerous volunteer opportunities in the area including but not limited to Neighbor to Neighbors, Center of Hope, the Manna House, and Stars and Strides Stables, a therapeutic riding center for children, adults, and veterans with disabilities.

We also offer the Springtown Legends Museum which captures Springtown’s rich heritage and community spirit.

The city hosts annual events such as Old-Fashioned Christmas, a local celebration that encompasses the spirit of the holiday. Our nostalgic historic square is centered on a State of Texas recognized historic site that includes a carefully preserved open air Tabernacle which adds to not only our Christmas celebration, but the other events held in our City’s center annually. One such gathering is our annual Wild West Festival where over 200 vendors arrive sporting their goods, along with a parade and of course, some local western-style showdowns.

Springtown is just a short driving distance to many family-oriented activities including local recreational lakes such as Eagle Mountain Lake; Sundance Square in beautiful downtown Fort Worth; a variety museums, zoos, and other cultural centers such at the Fort Worth Stock Show and Rodeo; and major sports teams — the Dallas Cowboys, Texas Rangers, and the Dallas Mavericks.
