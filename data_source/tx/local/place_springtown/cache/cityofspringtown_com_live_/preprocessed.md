The City of Springtown fosters a community spirit that make it the best place to live, work, and play in Parker County.

The city hosts annual events such as Old-Fashioned Christmas, a local celebration that encompasses the spirit of the holiday. Our nostalgic historic square is centered on a State of Texas recognized historic site that includes a carefully preserved open air Tabernacle which adds to not only our Christmas celebration, but the other events held in our City’s center annually. One such gathering is our annual Wild West Festival where over 200 vendors arrive sporting their goods, along with a parade and of course, some local western-style showdowns.
