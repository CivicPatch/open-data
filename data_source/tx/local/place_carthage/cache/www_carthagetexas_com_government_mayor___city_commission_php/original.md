Subsection (c). It shall not be necessary to the validity of any ordinance, resolution, order or act of the *commission* that does not impede a penalty, fine or forfeiture for the violation of its provisions, that it shall be read more than one time or considered at more than one session of the *city* *commission*.

Subsection (d). Every ordinance shall be authenticated by the signatures of the mayor and the *city* secretary and shall be systematically recorded and indexed in an ordinance book in a manner provided by the *commission*. It shall be only necessary to record the caption or title of ordinances in the minutes or journal of the *commission* meetings.

Subsection (e). Emergency ordinances. To meet a public emergency affecting life, health, property or the public peace, the *commission* may adopt one or more ordinances, but such ordinances may not levy taxes, grant, renew or extend a franchise, regulate the rate charged by any public utility for its service, or authorize the borrowing of money except as provided in[Section 18](https://library.municode.com/tx/carthage/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTICH_S18EMAP). An emergency ordinance shall be introduced in the form and manner prescribed for ordinances generally, except that it shall be plainly designated as an emergency ordinance and shall contain, after the enacting clause, a declaration stating that an emergency exists and describing it in clear and specific terms. An emergency ordinance may be adopted with or without amendment or rejection at the meeting at which it is introduced, but the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire *commission* shall be required for adoption. After its adoption the ordinance shall be published and printed as prescribed for other adopted ordinances. It shall become effective upon adoption or at such later time as it may specify. Every emergency ordinance except one made pursuant to[Section 18](https://library.municode.com/tx/carthage/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTICH_S18EMAP) shall automatically stand repealed as of the 61st day following the date on which it was adopted, but this shall not prevent reenactment of the ordinance in the manner specified in this section if the emergency still exists. An emergency ordinance may also be repealed by adoption of a repealing ordinance in the same manner specified in this section for the adoption of emergency ordinances.

(Ord. of 2-9-1971, § 1, Amend. No. 7; Ord. of 2-14-1972, § 1, Amend. No. 1)
