The City of Corinth is proud to host a variety of vibrant community events throughout the year that we invite passionate vendors to be part of the experience. From food trucks and handmade goods to local services, we welcome a diverse range of vendors to contribute to Corinth's event success.

All food vendors are required to have an up-to-date health permit from any surrounding municipality or county, food handlers permit for each individual scheduled to work the events, and pass a Fire Marshal inspection the day of the event,
for Mobile Food Vehicles. Vendor fee includes a 10x20 booth space and product exclusivity. Access to electricity is not provided.

In the event of inclement weather or other circumstances that cause the City of Corinth to cancel an event, vendor registrations will be transferred to a future City of Corinth event of the vendor's choosing, subject to space availability and equal or lesser value.
