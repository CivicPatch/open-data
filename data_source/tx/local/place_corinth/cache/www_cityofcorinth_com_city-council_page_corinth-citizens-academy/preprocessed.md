The Corinth Citizen's Academy is a free 8-week program designed to provide participants with an overview of the City's services and how they shape the day-to-day lives of our residents. Graduates will gain valuable insight into municipal operations through engaging sessions with the City's executive leadership staff, featuring hands-on activities and behind-the-scenes tours in a small group setting.

Participants must be at least 18 years of age and reside in Corinth.  Priority will be given to those who have not previously served or currently serve in an elected or appointed role.

**Applications for the 2025 Corinth Citizen's Academy are now closed. To learn more about the program and future classes, please contact the City Manager's office at (940) 498-3246 or
