ELECTRONIC BILLS - EMAIL MY BILLS

CHOOSE YOUR BILLING PREFERENCE
Ebills - With electronic billing, your bills are emailed to you monthly! No more worrying about it being lost in the mail, sitting on a pile on the counter or inadvertently being tossed with the junk mail. (This option is not the same as bank drafting your payment each month.)
Paper - Receive your bills monthly in the mail.



Business Accounts Only: I grant permission for utility billing to speak to any current staff member upon verification of Tax ID number regarding the service address listed above.
