Boards, Commissions, and Committees are essential in assisting the City Council with fulfilling its obligations to the residents of Corinth. Participation on a Board, Commission, or Committee provides residents an opportunity to understand the governmental process and play a vital role in the communication process between our residents and elected officials. Members of all Boards, Commissions, and Committees must be residents of the City for at least six (6) months preceding the appointment date and must be qualified voters. No officer of the City nor any person holding a compensated position with the City shall be appointed to any Board, Commission, or Committee created or established by the Charter other than in an advisory capacity. Applications are retained for two years. Should a vacancy occur on a Board, Commission, or Committee, the City Council will review applications for a possible appointment.

All Boards, Commissions, and Committees operate under the authority of the Mayor and City Council. It is the responsibility of the Mayor and City Council to evaluate whether each body is effectively fulfilling its assigned duties and responsibilities. Ultimately, the City Council holds the legal authority for all decisions made on behalf of the local government.
