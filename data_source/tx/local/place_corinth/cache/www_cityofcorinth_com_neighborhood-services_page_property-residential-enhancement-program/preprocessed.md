THE 2025-2026 PREP PROGRAM IS NOW OPEN (October1, 2025 - September 30, 2026)

The Property Residential Enhancement Program (PREP) supports a partnership between the City of Corinth and residential homeowners by providing reimbursable grants that aim to improve and enhance households as well as create a shared sense of community in a neighborhood. Through the PREP, homeowners may receive financial assistance through a grant-rebate to assist with exterior repairs to their home.

Applications may be submitted
[here](https://www.cityofcorinth.com/neighborhood-services/webform/property-residential-enhancement-program-application)
.
Please anticipate 10-15 business days for application review.
Further questions may be submitted to
[preprogram@corinthtx.gov](mailto:preprogram@corinthtx.gov)
. You may also contact the Neighborhood Services Coordinator directly at (940) 498-3274.

City of Corinth homeowners may be eligible for assistance under the PREP. For specific requirements, please refer to the PREP Guidelines.
