The Corinth Youth Advisory Council (YAC) is made up of students ages 14–18 who either live within the Corinth City limits or attend school in Corinth. The Council can hold up to 15 members, all serving as the voice of Corinth’s youth and helping shape the future of the community. YAC is supported by the Staff Liaison, who helps guide members and connect them with City programs and initiatives.

YAC was formed to empower young leaders and give them a platform to share their ideas with City Staff and Council. In return, members gain valuable experience and insight into how local government works – from budgeting and leadership to event planning and community service.

* Plan and take part in City events and service projects

YAC meets once a month, attends occasional City Council meetings, and participates in a weekend trip to the statewide YAC Summit. Members also earn service hours by volunteering at City events.
