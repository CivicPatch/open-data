Roadside Attraction Art Unveiled at SMART Museum

27 March

The Nolanville Art Program recently installed its latest art piece....and it doesn't get more Texas than this! Located at the SMART Museum, "Roadside Attraction" by renowned Texas artist, Joe Barrington, serves as a powerful reminder of our waste habits. Did you know that the U.S. only recycles 8% of its 290 million discarded tires annually and 44% of nearly 50 million metric tons of steel? "Roadside Attraction" prompts us to reflect on our environmental impact and rethink our consumption habits. As you admire this piece of art, let it not only bring a smile to your face but also inspire your thoughts on the immense scale of our discarded materials has on our environment. Join us in embracing sustainable practices and making a difference for our planet!
