Update Regarding Annual Alarm System Registrations.
To consolidate records and streamline services, Effective January 1, 2026, residents will no longer register their alarm systems through the City. Instead, all alarm registrations will now be completed directly through the Memorial Villages Police Department (MVPD) website on an annual basis. That link will be on the Police website (<https://www.mvpdtx.org/>) under Alarm System Registration on the homepage.  **The link will be active after January 1, 2026
