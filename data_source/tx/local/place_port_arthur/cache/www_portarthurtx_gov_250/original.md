------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The city is governed by a council-manager form of government where the City Council sets city policy and the City Manager is responsible for city operations. The council consists of a mayor and six council members. All council members are elected for one three-year term, up to three consecutive terms.

Elected officials are under a mixed system of single-member districts and at-large seats.

At-Large Position
-----------------

At-large candidates may reside in any area of the city and are elected to represent the whole city. All voters can vote for candidates running for an at-large seat.

Single-Member Districts
-----------------------

A single-member district is a geographically defined voter district represented by a single elected official. Only registered voters that live within the specified district's boundaries can vote for candidates who run for a seat in the district. Candidates must live in the single-member district in which they run.
