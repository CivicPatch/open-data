City of Iowa Park Advisory Board Application (submit online)
------------------------------------------------------------

Citizens are welcome to address the City Council at regular meetings.  Citizens’ input is included on the agendas of most public meetings.  To participate, individuals must sign up with the City’s meeting registrar prior to the start of the meeting, and discussion time is generally limited to five (5) minutes per individual registered.  Topics which are discussed by individuals of the audience will not be addressed or discussed by the City Council and/or its staff members as the Texas Open Meetings Act prohibits discussion by the Council on any topic not listed on the official posted agenda. If action by the City Council is in order, an item can be placed on an agenda by contacting the City Secretary, City Manager or Mayor, prior to the preparation of the agenda (usually about a week before the meeting).  Requests can be submitted by mail, email, telephone, text, fax, or in person.  City Hall is open Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and staff will address any questions, comments, or concerns from the public.

A regular general election of the City Council of the City of Iowa Park is held annually on the first Saturday in May, in accordance with the Texas Election Code.  A notice of General Election as prescribed by the Texas Secretary of State is posted on the door to City Council Chambers (103 E Cash St), on the bulletin board inside City Hall (103 N Wall), and on the City’s website (IowaPark.com).  Notice of Election was published in the Electra Star News, the official newspaper of the City and on various social media sites used by the City.  The Secretary of State is the chief election officer for the State of Texas. The Secretary of State’s
provides assistance and advice to election officials on the proper conduct of elections and assistance to the general public on voter registration and other election issues.  This information is available toll-free at 1-800-252-VOTE (8683), and online (sos.state.tx.us/elections).
