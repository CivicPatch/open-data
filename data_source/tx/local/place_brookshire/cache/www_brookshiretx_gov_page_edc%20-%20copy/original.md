Brookshire Economic Development Corporation

The Brookshire Economic Development Corporation (EDC) focuses on promoting economic growth and enhancing the quality of life in Brookshire, a small city in Waller County, Texas, located about 30 miles west of Houston. As a Type B EDC, its primary mission is to stimulate business investment, job creation, and infrastructure improvements within the community.  
  
Key highlights of the Brookshire EDC:  
  
1. Business Attraction and Retention: The Brookshire EDC actively works to attract new businesses to the area and support the growth of existing ones. This includes offering financial incentives, such as tax abatements, grants, and low-interest loans, to encourage investment.  
  
2. Infrastructure Development: A significant focus is placed on improving the infrastructure necessary to support economic development. This includes upgrading roads, utilities, and public services to accommodate new and expanding businesses.  
  
3. Workforce Development: The EDC collaborates with educational institutions, like local community colleges and workforce training programs, to ensure that the local labor force has the skills needed by employers in various industries.  
  
4. Commercial and Industrial Growth: Brookshire’s location near major transportation routes like Interstate 10 and the Union Pacific Railroad makes it attractive for logistics, manufacturing, and distribution businesses. The EDC seeks to leverage these assets to draw in large commercial and industrial projects.  
  
5. Quality of Life Initiatives: Beyond business and infrastructure, the EDC also invests in improving amenities and services that enhance the community's quality of life, such as parks, recreational facilities, and cultural activities.  
  
6. Key Industries: Brookshire is known for its agriculture, oil and gas, and manufacturing sectors. In recent years, there has been an increased focus on logistics and warehousing, given the city's proximity to Houston and major highways.  
  
Through its efforts, the Brookshire EDC aims to build a strong, diversified economy while maintaining the community’s small-town charm.
