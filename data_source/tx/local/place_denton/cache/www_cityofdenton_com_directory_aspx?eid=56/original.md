Biography
---------

Gerard Hudspeth was born and raised in Denton, where he attended Denton High School, earned his associates degree from North Central Texas College, and earned his bachelor's degree from the University of North Texas. After volunteering for many years on the Denton Planning and Zoning board, Gerard was elected to serve two terms on the City Council representing District 1. In 2019, his fellow Council Members selected him as Mayor Pro Tem and he was elected Mayor in 2020. He was subsequently re-elected for a second and third term in 2022 and 2024, respectively. Gerard currently serves as the President of the Metroplex Mayors Association.

Gerard and his family have always had a passion for giving back to the community and that drive led him to become a volunteer with both CASA and Mentor Denton to help serve at-risk kids and ensure they are provided every possible opportunity for success. Gerard is also active with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the Denton Breakfast Kiwanis, Denton Chamber of Commerce, the Denton Black Chamber of Commerce, and as a member of the UNT Alumni Association. Professionally, he works in sales for a veteran-owned IT service and solutions company.

Gerard and his wife, Diane, have been married for over 14 years and are proud parents of four wonderful daughters. His favorite book is Joseph: A Man of Integrity and Forgiveness by Charles R. Swindoll.
