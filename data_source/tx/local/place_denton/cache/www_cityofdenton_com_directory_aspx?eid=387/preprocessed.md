Suzi Rumohr
===========

[City Council](https://www.cityofdenton.com/Directory.aspx?DID=49)

[Email Suzi Rumohr](mailto:Suzi.Rumohr@cityofdenton.com)

Suzi Rumohr is serving her first term as the representative for District 3, and currently serves as Mayor Pro Tem. Suzi became engaged in local government through road safety efforts and a desire for everyone to safely reach their destinations no matter how they travel around. This interest quickly expanded to learning how city design and policies influence transportation, congestion, housing costs, property taxes, air quality, public health, small businesses, and the city’s ability to sustain itself for generations to come.

Suzi has coordinated, facilitated, and actively participated in local events relating to affordable housing, missing middle housing, sustainable development, bicycle safety, and the statewide Texas Trails and Active Transportation Conference.
Having lived all over Denton in a variety of housing types, Suzi uses multiple modes of transportation to get around Denton, including biking, driving, walking, and public transportation. As a research librarian, she is endlessly curious and always ready to learn something new.

Born and raised in Paris, Texas, Suzi moved to Denton in 2005 to attend the University of North Texas, where she earned bachelor’s degrees in Anthropology, Spanish, and a secondary teaching certification. She later earned a master’s in Library Science from UNT and has worked as a research librarian at Texas Woman’s University since 2014.

Suzi lives a mile north of UNT with her spouse, Garret, and their overly friendly rescue pup, Moxie.
