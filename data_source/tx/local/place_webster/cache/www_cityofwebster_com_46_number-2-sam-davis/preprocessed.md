Number 2: Sam Davis
===================

Sam Davis has embarked on his first term on the Webster City Council, bringing a wealth of experience from his lifelong career in public service. Drawn to local politics as a natural extension of his service-oriented background, Councilmember Davis aims to leverage his extensive law enforcement experience for the community’s benefit.

Born in Hampshire, England, Councilmember Davis followed in his father’s footsteps, serving in the Royal Navy before transitioning to law enforcement. His career spanned various roles, from the Wiltshire Constabulary to SWAT teams with the Bermuda Police and NASA Johnson Space Center. In 2017, Councilmember Davis was hired and sponsored by the Webster Police Department for a seven-month course with the Pasadena Police Academy. He quickly became a familiar and trusted figure in the community.

“I got to see the City growing residentially and commercially daily,” says Councilmember Davis. “I found Webster to be a great place to work.”

Councilmember Davis’s family is a significant part of his life. He has three daughters, who have embraced his new life in Webster.

Beyond his Council duties, Councilmember Davis is an avid reader, golfer, and gardener, a passion inherited from his mother. He enjoys sharing his expertise with colleagues and students as a firearms instructor.

His connection to Webster deepened when he met and married Ginger Kerrick, a long-time Edgewater resident, in 2021. Councilmember Davis cites his wife, Ginger, as a significant influence on his leadership style, emphasizing the importance of emotional intelligence and personal connection. He values Webster’s safety, convenience, and vibrant community life and aims to enhance these qualities during his term.

“The one person that is the epitome of what it is to be a good leader with great governance is my wife, Ginger,” says Councilmember Davis. “I have watched and listened to her coach, train, manage, encourage, and mentor her peers, where she has total respect, compassion, and understanding on an individual and personal level.”

Active in community service, Councilmember Davis has guided British students around NASA Johnson Space Center for over ten years and taught police cadets at Alvin Community College. His goals for the Council include improving safety and security while fostering a collaborative environment that promotes growth and prosperity.

Councilmember Davis is dedicated to representing Webster’s residents with honesty, integrity, and transparency, striving to make the City a thriving place to live and do business.

“I understand that there is a need to ensure the continued balance between the entrepreneurial expansion that keeps Webster strong and the interests of residents,” says Councilmember Davis. “The only way to achieve this balance is through good stewardship in the City Council brought about by honesty, integrity, collaboration, and transparency with the residents and business owners.”
