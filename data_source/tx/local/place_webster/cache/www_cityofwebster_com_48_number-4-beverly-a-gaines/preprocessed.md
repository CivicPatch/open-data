Council Position Number 4: Beverly A. Gaines
============================================

Beverly Gaines has served the City of Webster since 1999 when she became a resident of this municipality. Gaines and her husband of 50 years, Ron, moved to Webster from Sealy where she had been very active in local government as an election clerk and judge.

Beverly Gaines has served on City Council from 2006 to 2012, then from 2015 to the present.

Gaines not only serves as President of Texas Municipal League Region 14 but also presides as Vice President of Texas Municipal League’s TAMCC Affiliate.

During Gaines’ tenure on City Council, she has earned the prestigious Certified Municipal Official designation that connotes dedication to her office and city. Just as society and its challenges and opportunities evolve, so, too, do regulations, laws, and best practices for municipal government officials. Continual and continuing education prepares Gaines to serve her constituents, fellow council members, and staff in the best possible manner.

Some of Gaines’ coursework has consisted of financial oversight, budgets, fiscal best practices, public funds investment act, municipal policies, workplace conflict and strategies for resolution, information technology practices, leadership, and biannual legislative updates.

Her service tenure illuminates a wide range of interests, like the Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone, Zoning Board of Adjustments, Celebration Committee, Harris County Mayor and Council Association, Houston-Galveston Area Council, and ERCOT.

Beverly Gaines is dedicated to serving Webster with her commitment to maintain a high level of safety, City services, fiscal responsibility, and quality of life, together with a low property tax rate and pro-business mentality.
