Lori An Gobert

Lori An Gobert

Mayor of Columbus

August 2018 to Present

Lori An Gobert arrived in Columbus in January 2000, with her husband for his work.  She found Columbus so welcoming, with so much to do.  She quickly became involved in the community.  She served as President of the Live Oak Art Center, President of the Convention & Visitors Bureau, President of the City of Columbus Industrial Development Corporation, President and Past District Governor of Pilot Club, and she served on several other boards and committees.

Lori An loves the proximity to the many things to do in the region; the beauty of our historic downtown

area as well as the developing business corridors throughout the City.  She is proud to call Columbus home.
