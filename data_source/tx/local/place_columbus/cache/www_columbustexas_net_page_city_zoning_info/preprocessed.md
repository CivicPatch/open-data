The City Council of the City of Columbus approved a zoning ordinance on April 26th, 1999.
This ordinance is specifically aimed at protecting the public health, safety, and the general welfare of the citizens of the City. The regulations are necessary to encourage the most appropriate use of land; to reduce fire hazards and to improve public safety; to decrease traffic congestion and its accompanying hazards; to prevent the undue concentration of population; to lay a proper foundation for the reasonable termination of land use activities which are not in conformance with the City's long-range use plans; to create a comprehensive and stable pattern of land uses; to maintain and stabilize property values; to develop an efficient and effective basis upon which to provide services for water supply, sanitary and storm sewer systems, pedestrian and automobile circulation, schools, parks, and other public facilities.
The ordinance in its entirety along with all other ordinances can be reviewed by
