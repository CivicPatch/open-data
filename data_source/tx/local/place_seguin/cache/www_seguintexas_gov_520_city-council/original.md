City Council
============

Overview
--------

The Seguin City Council is comprised of a Mayor and eight City Council Members. Council members are elected from the district in which they reside, with the exception of the mayor who is elected at large. Council members and the mayor are elected to serve four-year terms, with a maximum limit of 2 terms. In the absence of the mayor, the mayor pro tem presides over council meetings. District 1 Council Member Joe Rea currently serves as Mayor Pro-Tem.

City Council is responsible for approving an annual operating budget, setting the tax rate, adopting all city ordinances, planning for capital improvements, as well as appointing a City Manager that serves as chief executive to oversee day-to-day municipal operations.
