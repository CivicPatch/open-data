* Office of the Mayor

****Mayor's Welcome****
![]()
![MayorAG2024](https://www.weslacotx.gov/MayorAG2024.jpg?t=202401031749550)

**Mayor**

**Adrian Gonzalez**
Adrian Gonzalez was elected Mayor of the City of Weslaco, Texas, in November 2023.
Weslaco is the fifth-largest city in Hidalgo County and one of the region’s fastest-growing
communities.
A proud native of Weslaco, Mayor Gonzalez is the son of hardworking migrant parents,
Rudy, a farmer, and Eva Gonzalez, an employee of St. Joan of Arc. He is also the proud
father of four children: Adrian Jr., Alexie, Aiden, and Alexander.
Mayor Gonzalez’s commitment to public service began early. In 2006, at just 25 years
old, he made history as the youngest City Commissioner ever elected in Weslaco. He
served on the City Commission until 2009 and later continued his service as a member
of the Weslaco Independent School District Board of Trustees from 2012 to 2016.
Throughout his life, Mayor Gonzalez has remained deeply involved in the community. He
is an active member of several civic and faith-based organizations, including the Knights
of Columbus, ACTS Community, and the Weslaco Mid-Valley Lions Club. His passion for
supporting local youth is evident through his mentorship of student-athletes and his
longstanding support of local high school bands and athletic programs,
including  basketball, volleyball, baseball, and football.
With a strong vision for Weslaco’s future, Mayor Gonzalez is focused on building a smart,
sustainable city driven by innovation in education, technology, communication, and  infrastructure.
“As your Mayor, I look forward to strengthening community involvement, enhancing
public safety, improving roads and traffic flow, and advancing our city’s infrastructure,”
Gonzalez said. “We must take proactive measures to reduce crime, prevent fire and
medical incidents, and ensure effective code enforcement. Together, we can enhance
Weslaco’s visual appeal, protect public health, and improve the quality of life for all residents.”
Mayor Gonzalez leads with proactive governance and a steadfast commitment to
transparency, fiscal responsibility, and strong community engagement as he leads
Weslaco into its next chapter of growth and opportunity.
