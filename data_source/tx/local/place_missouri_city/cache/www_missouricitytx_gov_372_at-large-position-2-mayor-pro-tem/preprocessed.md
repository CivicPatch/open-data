Lynn Clouser
------------

Lynn Clouser was raised in Fort Bend County and is currently in her second term as Missouri City's Councilwoman At-Large, Position 2. Councilwoman Clouser serves as a member of the city's Economic Development Committee and is also the chair of the city's Small Business Advisory Committee that she is credited for starting during her few six months in office. Councilwoman Clouser created Missouri City's very first entrepreneur camp for youth, The Kidpreneur Camp, a three-day workshop where local middle and high schoolers learn the critical steps to starting a business and concludes with a Pitch Day. Councilwoman Clouser continues to champion efforts for veterans, senior citizens, small businesses, and differently abled populations in the 'Show Me City'. Although her resume is long, she likes to sum it up in two words 'Servant Leader' following in the footsteps of her father retired Precinct 2 Justice of the Peace, Judge Joel Clouser, Sr. who retired after serving 29 years on the bench in Fort Bend County.

Councilwoman Clouser is the Director of Network Engagement for Imagine Pediatrics for the state of Texas a pediatrician led 24/7 virtual-first care in the home for children with complex medical conditions and special care needs on Medicaid plans. Lynn is the proud recipient of the following awards and distinctions: 2021 President's Lifetime Achievement Award, The Texas Legislative Black Caucus 2021 Outstanding Texans of House District 27, 2022 D-Mars Top 30 Influential Women of Houston, Perfect Connections Evolution of Autism 2022 Outstanding Autism Advocate Award Honoree, Suburban Sugar Land Women 2023 Women's History Honoree, 2023 Ever Ready Lodge Number 506 Trailblazer Award, and the 2023 Santee and Associates Presidential Volunteer Service Award just to name a few.

Councilwoman Clouser attended The High School for Health Professions, received her bachelor's degree in mass media arts from Hampton University, and has previously served on the Board of Directors for Hope for Three Autism Advocates, the Advisory Board for the
Transition Services Committee and The Sienna Farmers Market. She is the Co-Founder of Autism Caregivers Around the Bend, a support group for those caring for loved ones with autism.

Lynn lends her time and talents to various causes and community organizations she holds near and dear to her heart such as the Mu Kappa Omega Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., The Missouri City-Sugar Land Chapter of Jack and Jill of America, Inc., Fort Bend Women's Center, the Sienna Farmers Market, and helps with countless community initiatives in and around Fort Bend County.

The mother of two children, Councilwoman Clouser's favorite quote is "Aspire to Inspire before you Expire." In her spare time, she loves golfing, supporting local businesses, mentoring college women, empowering fellow parents who are raising children with autism, serving as a stylist for J. Hilburn men's custom clothiers, mingling with other cigar aficionados, listening to live music, and attending fundraisers for great causes.
