[City Codes](https://ecode360.com/ED6296)

As a part of national legislation to clean up the nation's waterways, several regulations have been enacted concerning management of what we can allow to pass from our home and streets into the drainage system. One of those rules prohibits the depositing of lawn clippings and debris onto the street. As of July 2010 citations have been issued to offenders. Please clean up those clippings after you mow your yard or notify your lawn care service to do this.
