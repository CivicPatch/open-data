Edgecliff Village Public Works has resumed meter upgrades. With the upgraded meters there is more transparency into each residents usage down to hour by hour usage rather than usage being measured monthly. Every resident will have the same access to view usage as Utility Billing. EyeOnWater allows our residents to view their usages and set up automatic alerts regarding their usage, as well as being able to pin point exactly when a leak or high usage occurs.
