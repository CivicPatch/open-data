#### Blue Star Memorial

The Texas sky was a beautiful clear blue and filled with sunshine on November 12, 2012 as the Edgecliff Village Garden Club gathered with guests and community members to proudly unveil and dedicate our Blue Star Memorial Marker. The date was chosen to coincide with Veteran's Day. The joyful and patriotic event culminated after a process of fundraising by our club to purchase the marker. The member's money raising projects included a garage sale, spaghetti supper and a cake walk at our village's Halloween Carnival. Our volunteer Park and Recreation Board with garden club members planned and oversaw the installation of a large memorial garden that includes drip irrigation. The new garden's Knock Out roses and red yuccas surround and beautify the Blue Starr Memorial Marker site in our Edgecliff Village Bird Sanctuary Park.

The ceremony began with garden club President Sheri Joblin welcoming those in attendance followed by presentation of colors by a United States Marine Corp Color Guard and the Pledge of Allegiance led by a veteran. The event continued with the singing of the "Star Spangled Banner" and the invocation and introduction of guests and officials. Mary Matl, Blue Star Memorial Chair, gave the history of the marker and led the moving military tribute that called members of each military branch forward while their service branch's anthem was played. The servicemen and women were applauded and presented flags. President Joplin read the dedication after Mayor Tony Dauphinot accepted the marker for our village and thanked and congratulated club members for their generous gift. A large floral wreath was placed at the base of the marker by a veteran followed by benediction, singing of "God Bless America" and the playing of "Taps" by a volunteer from Buglers across America. The event concluded with the firing salute of two Civil War Mountain Howitzer cannons loaned by Ms. Joblin. Guests then adjourned to a reception at city hall funded by our village and hosted by club members.  
  
Our club members are grateful to Gayle Wilson, Texas Garden Club Blue Star Memorial Chair, for attending our event and her leadership on this worthy project. Our garden club has been affiliated with National Garden Clubs and Texas Garden Club for 58 years. Our Edgecliff Village Garden Club members take great pride in our Blue Star Memorial Marker that serves as our loving and lasting legacy in Edgecliff Village.

#### ​History of the Marker

The Blue Star Memorial Marker Program of the National Garden Clubs began in 1945 to honor the men and women serving in the Armed Forces during World War 2. The name was chosen for the star on the flags displayed in homes and businesses donating a family member serving in the war. Garden Clubs envisioned a ribbon of memorials and beautiful plantings traversing every state to honor our armed forces and to beautify our great country. The Blue Star Memorial program has in fact grown to extend thousands of miles across the continental US, Alaska and Hawaii. The blue star memorial marker honors and glorifies all men and women who have served, are serving or will serve in the Armed forces of the United States. Markers continue to be dedicated each year on highways, veteran's facilities, national cemeteries, park, civic and historic sites.
