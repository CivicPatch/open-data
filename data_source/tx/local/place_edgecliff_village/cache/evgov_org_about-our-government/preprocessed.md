About Our City Government
=========================

Edgecliff Village has a strong Mayor-Council form of government. The City's elected officials, serving concurrent two year terms, are: the Mayor and 5 Aldermen. The City Aldermanic (General Law) Charter provides the constitutional framework within which city government operates. The City's Code of Ordinances contains the laws of the City.

**MAYOR**
The Mayor serves as the Executive Officer of the City. As the City's chief administrator and official representative, the Mayor is responsible for the general management of the City for seeing that all laws and ordinances are enforced.

**CITY COUNCIL**

​The City Council is the City's legislative body, with the power to enact and enforce all ordinances and resolutions. 5 Aldermen are elected at-large, by all voters of the City. The five members of Council, along with the Mayor, act only by ordinance, resolution or motion. Council determines its own rules of procedure, and its meetings are open to the public.
