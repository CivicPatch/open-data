About Town Council:
-------------------

![Town Council](https://www.trophyclub.org/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=1409)
The Town Council serves as a link between the residents of Trophy Club and their municipal government. The Town of Trophy Club operates under a council-manager form of government as approved by voters through the adoption of the Town of Trophy Club Charter.

The Trophy Club Charter provides that the Trophy Club Town Council shall consist of the Mayor and six Council members elected by numbered places and are elected at-large by the registered voters of Trophy Club to serve three-year, staggered terms of office.

Councilors help constituents by connecting them to resources, services, and Town departments. Town Council also administers the Town's goals, major projects and infrastructure improvements ranging from community growth to land use to finances and strategic planning. They serve as advocates for all Trophy Club residents.
