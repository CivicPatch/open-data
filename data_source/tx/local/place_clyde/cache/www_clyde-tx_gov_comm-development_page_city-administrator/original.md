Rodger Brown moved to Clyde in 1981. It was here that he met Melanie Beasley and they were married in 1983. In 1985, he joined the USAF, and was stationed at Reese AFB, TX for 5 years. His next assignment was to Hill AFB in Utah in Feb of 1990, and in Aug of 1990, he was sent to Al Minhad Air Base in Dubai, UAE, in support of Operation Desert Shield/Storm. After 8 months in the desert, his unit returned home, and a year later, his family headed back home to Texas. In 1993, he began working for the USPS in Teague, TX, and in 1997, he transferred To Abilene, where worked until retirement in 2022

City Administrator Brown served on the Clyde City Council from 2005 to 2013 and then served as Mayor from 2017 to 2025, resigning to fill in as interim.

His goal is to help the council and staff to make and sustain Clyde as the home that everyone wants to call home.  It is his goal to ensure that Clyde continues to grow and can offer the citizens all that they need and want and should expect from their hometown.
