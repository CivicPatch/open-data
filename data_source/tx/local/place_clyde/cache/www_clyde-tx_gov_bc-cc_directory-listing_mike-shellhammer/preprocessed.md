I was born and raised in a small NW Ohio town, where I lived and worked and met my beautiful wife Tammy. I worked for the Sheriff Dept there for 10 years until my wife and I wanted a change, and we moved to Wyoming, where I was a Ranch Manager of a Cattle ranch until we moved back to Ohio. After living in Ohio for a while, we decided we missed Wyoming, and we moved back, where I took a job working at a coal mine as a Blaster. I worked there until I noticed the economy was changing. That was when we decided to move to Texas. My wife and I then purchased our current home here in Clyde. I worked for a bit at a company in Abilene, but found a better opportunity. I took a maintenance position with TxDOT. After being in that position for 2 years, I was moved up to Safety Officer. I have two beautiful daughters and 2 very successful stepsons, along with 5 beautiful grandchildren. I was elected in November 2025 thanks to the great citizens of Clyde. I look forward to helping build back the City and working with our current administration.
