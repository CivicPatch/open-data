Profile

I was born and raised in Abilene, where I met my husband, John, in 1999.  We have three fantastic kids. I graduated from Cooper High School in 1998. I was a stay-at-home mom for many years.  I then went to college to study medical management and coding, where I earned my associate degree. Medical wasn’t for me, so I went into management. I worked for Beauty Supply Group and started as a Part-Time employee, then quickly became a district manager.  I have been a trainer, inventory manager, purchaser, department manager, and business owner.  My grandpa lived in Clyde, and I always remember visiting him and how I loved the town. So, we decided to move here. We now own Jolly’s Scoops and Callahan Thrift.

     I love working with people and staying busy, and my goal as a City Counsel woman is to continue local traditions, listen to the community, and make sound decisions in growing the future of Clyde. I want everyone who visits here to want to live here and know that Clyde is a fantastic place to call Home.
