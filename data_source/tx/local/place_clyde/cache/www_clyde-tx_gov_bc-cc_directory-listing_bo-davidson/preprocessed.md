I am a freelance software automation developer with a background in mortgage bonds. Seeing the hardship that Clyde residents were forced to endure, I decided to throw my hat into the ring to be part of a team to get Clyde back into a rational financial standing and improve transparency. It's my belief that the best way to do that is through individual due diligence and awareness of all City matters. In addition, it's my goal for Clyde to benefit from area developments so that our citizens no longer have to shoulder such a heavy burden.
