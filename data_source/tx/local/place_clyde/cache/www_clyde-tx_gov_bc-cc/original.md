Mayor & City Council
====================

The City of Clyde operates under the council-administrator form of government in which the City Council is responsible for all City policy and the City Administrator is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the City. The City Administrator is appointed by the City Council and serves at their pleasure. The City Council is composed of six members. Five council members and the mayor are all elected at-large on a nonpartisan basis to serve overlapping two-year terms. The mayor is elected to serve a two-year term as presiding officer at City Council meetings, votes in the case of ties and serves as the official head of the City for legislative and ceremonial purposes.

The City Council is the City's legislative and policy-making body. The City Council is responsible for passing ordinances and resolutions necessary for governing the City, as well as for setting the direction of City policy. The City Administrator is responsible for the overall administration of the City. This responsibility includes implementation of the City Council's goals and strategies. The City Administrator, with the help of the staff, provides the City Council with the information needed to fulfill its legislative role.

**Council meetings are held on the  2nd Tuesday of every month at 6:00 p.m.  
  
at City Hall, 222 Oak Street, Clyde, TX 79510.**

The Council welcomes and appreciates your attendance and participation in continuing to make Clyde a great community.
