Growing up, we moved around quite a bit, but I spent most of my childhood in both Oklahoma and Texas, including two stints in the Big Country. I have spent most of my adult life in Texas and raised my kids in the El Campo area just southwest of Houston. While in the Houston area, I began work for Whataburger Maintenance Services and eventually worked my way up to Field Director, where I held that position for several years. I left there to pursue an opportunity to purchase part of Clear Fork Roofing Company, at which time, while house hunting in the area with my wonderful wife Sylvia, we just fell in love with Clyde and the community as a whole and decided to settle here in 2016. Two of my daughters soon followed with their families.

My love of this community and the desire to serve is what prompted me to run for City Council, and with the support of the community, I was elected in November of 2024. It is my deep desire to serve to the best of my ability to help the City of Clyde continue to grow and prosper. We are so proud to Call Clyde home and cannot wait to see what the future holds for all of us.
