City Council
============

As a Home-Rule Municipality, Celina has been guided by elected representatives since its establishment in 1876. This governance structure empowers residents to actively participate in shaping the policies and initiatives that enhance their quality of life.

The City of Celina operates under the leadership of a Mayor and City Council, who are elected directly by the community. Together, they form the Governing Body, with all members serving three-year terms. The Mayor and City Council work collaboratively to establish the City’s goals and policies, ensuring that every decision reflects Celina’s mission to preserve its agricultural heritage, maintain exceptional public safety, and foster an extraordinary quality of life for all.

With a commitment to thoughtful governance and strategic vision, the Mayor and City Council serve the community with integrity and dedication - working to meet the needs of residents while shaping a vibrant future for Celina.

City Council Meetings

The Celina City Council convenes on the second Tuesday of each month to discuss and make decisions on key matters affecting the community. Meetings begin with an Executive Session at 5:00 PM, followed by the regular session at 6:30 PM. All meetings take place at the Celina City Council Chambers, located at 112 N Colorado Street. Residents are encouraged to attend and participate in the decision-making process that shapes our City’s future. For more information, please
