Dear Neighbors and Friends,

I am honored and humbled to have been elected Mayor of our dynamic and vibrant community. It is a privilege to have the opportunity to represent our residents, business owners, and visitors to our Celina community. For me, there is no greater honor than to serve our City building upon our rich heritage and working together toward a better future.

My family and I have a deep love and passion for the City of Celina. You can sense and feel that same passion when you meet and interact with fellow residents at a school function, sporting event, grocery store, and one of the 30-plus events held throughout the year. Celina is such a welcoming community, and our residents are the heartbeat of the City.

This community is growing rapidly, which means new opportunities and challenges. I believe that my role is to ensure that Celina is a place where everyone can thrive, businesses - both small and large - can flourish, and where you will feel safe and secure knowing that we have the best fire and police departments providing our public safety. Our hometown is a place where your children will have access to top-ranked schools, an emerging Collin College - Celina Campus, and devoted teachers, coaches, and administrators who are invested in ensuring the best education for all.

I am committed to continue to build and strengthen our community through collaboration, innovation, and a shared vision for the future. Working together with the City Council and our City Manager, we will continue to look to find new ways to improve our local infrastructure, create jobs, and enhance our quality of life by listening and partnering with our residents and business owners. I encourage you to share your ideas, concerns, and aspirations for Celina. Your input is vital to our success, and I am committed to listening to your feedback and working toward solutions that benefit us all.

One of the things that makes Celina so special is our long-history of unity and pride in our City. As an active volunteer, I encourage you to get involved in our community in some fashion. Whether it's volunteering at a special event, your child's school, or participating in our Adopt-A-Street Program, there are so many ways to give back. We will continue to maintain Celina's historic Downtown Square, small-town charm, traditions, and community pride through the engagement and involvement of our residents. That is what makes us #lifeconnected.

Thank you for choosing to be a part of Celina's best days!

Sincerely,

Ryan Tubbs  
Mayor, City of Celina
