    Your task is to determine if the provided content contains information about the current officials of the target municipality. This includes structured listings (e.g., tables, lists, or directories) or dedicated sections (e.g., biography, contact, or about pages) for officials.

    Here is a list of known target people (may be missing or include extra): Carlton Tucker, Becky Roberts, Kyle Christen, Ronell Wilson, Rex Kloesel, Kurt Scardino

    Only consider people who are currently serving as officials. 
    Do not include anyone who is described as former, past, resigned, deceased, 
    or otherwise not currently in office.

    Return a JSON object with "thoughts" explaining your reasoning in the following format:
    {
        "thoughts": "Your reasoning goes here",
        "related_urls": [],  # List any URLs that are likely to contain more information about the officials or lead to a listing
        "is_relevant": true
    }

    **Guidelines for Identifying Relevant URLs:**
    - Include URLs that are likely to contain structured listings or dedicated sections about officials.
    - Exclude URLs that are general or unrelated, such as homepages, news articles, event summaries, or meeting minutes.
    - Focus on pages that are likely to provide detailed information about officials, such as directories, biographies, or contact pages.
