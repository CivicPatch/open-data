Mayor Jim Sweeney
=================

![Jim Sweeney](http://www.seabrooktx.gov/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=20681)
Jim Sweeney has been a proud member of the Seabrook community since moving here in 2007. A successful businessman and entrepreneur, he has owned and operated his company for over 30 years. He has also served as a leader in several local nonprofits, including as Chair of the Clear Lake Area Chamber of Commerce Board, and is a long-standing member of the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership.

As Mayor, Jim is committed to preserving Seabrook’s small-town coastal charm while promoting smart, sustainable economic development. His goals include improving curb appeal along NASA Road 1 and enhancing city entrances to attract more visitors. He and the City Council are also focused on maintaining and improving Seabrook’s parks and trails, as well as expanding support for our local small businesses.

Jim and his wife, Jane, have been married for 42 years. They raised their three daughters in Seabrook and now enjoy spending time with their seven grandchildren and their rescue dog, Molly, a Great Dane. They love living in our coastal community and occasionally RVing, and Jim is even taking on the challenge of learning to play the piano!
