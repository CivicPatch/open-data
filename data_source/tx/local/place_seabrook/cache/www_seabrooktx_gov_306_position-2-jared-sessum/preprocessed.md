Position 2, Jared Sessum
========================

![Jared Sessum](http://www.seabrooktx.gov/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=20680)
My name is Jared Sessum, and I am honored to serve as your Seabrook City Councilmember for Position 2.

My wife, Jennifer, and I have proudly called Seabrook home for over 20 years, which is why we chose to raise our 11-year-old daughter here. We share our home with three beloved dogs—our two French Bulldogs, Brewsky and Stella, and our pitbull mix, Jameson. Our family is deeply rooted in this community and fully invested in its future.

With over two decades of experience in public safety, I currently serve as the EMS Captain of Operations for the City of Deer Park;I also volunteer with the Seabrook Volunteer Fire Department, serving as President and overseeing our First Responder Program. Public service isn’t just my profession—it’s my passion. Jennifer, whom I met while we were both working at Clear Lake Emergency Medical Corps, now serves as a registered nurse at Texas Children’s Hospital.

As your councilmember, I am committed to responsible growth, enhanced public safety, and fostering strong collaboration between residents, local businesses, and city leadership. Together, we can keep Seabrook a vibrant, safe, and welcoming place to live, work, and raise a family.
