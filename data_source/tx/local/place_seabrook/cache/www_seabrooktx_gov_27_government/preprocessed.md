   Council members are elected at large and serve the entire city, not a geographic precinct, for four-year terms. The mayor pro tem is appointed annually by fellow Council members. City Council positions are not full-time jobs.
2. Boards and commissions fulfill an important role in city government by evaluating issues which affect our community and making recommendations to the City Council for needed action. Although most boards and commissions are advisory in nature, a few are decision-making entities.
