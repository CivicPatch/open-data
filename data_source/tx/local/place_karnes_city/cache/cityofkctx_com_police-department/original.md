### Crime Stoppers

Karnes City Police Department participates in the Karnes County Crime Stoppers Program. How does crime stoppers work in Karnes County? Know about a crime? Report it and get **CASH** for tips.

If you ask most anyone if they ever heard of Crime Stoppers, they will invariably say they have because on a fairly, regular basis crime stoppers is mentioned on TV and ads are seen in the newspaper. However, if you ask how crime stoppers works, most people really don’t have a clue.

Let’s say you see a crime being committed or you have information concerning a crime that has been committed. You can call the Karnes County Crime Stoppers at **[(830) 780-4636](tel:8307804636 "Call (830) 780-4636") (INFO)** and give them the information. They will give you a report number. They will not ask your name or anything about you. They will also not have your phone number because the phone is not answered locally. Karnes County Crime Stoppers contracts with a company who takes calls from numerous Crime Stoppers organizations in Texas and the United States. The information is then forwarded to our Crime Stoppers’ Coordinator, who is on call 24-7. The Coordinator then forwards the information to the appropriate law enforcement agencies. Rewards will only be distributed if your tip leads to an arrest. You can check on the status of your reward, if any, by calling Crime Stoppers and giving them the report number you were given. If you are due a reward, you will be given instructions on how to collect it. No questions asked – no ID required. Protect your number because anyone with that number is able to collect the reward.
