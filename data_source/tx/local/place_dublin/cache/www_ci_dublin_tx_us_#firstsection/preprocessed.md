Greetings and thanks to all who visit our official website for the City of Dublin, Texas. We are located in Central Texas, in the southwest corner of Erath County. That's about two hours south of the DFW Metroplex, one hour east of Abilene, and two hours northwest of Austin.

City News

Legendary golfer Ben Hogan lived here as a child, Dublin Bottling Works continues to produce a robust line of pure cane sugar sodas (after bottling Dr Pepper for 120 years), and, in 2005, Governor Rick Perry signed a bill designating us the official Irish Capital of Texas.
We are a diverse group of citizens, families, farmers, businesspeople, artisans, and town folk who currently number just under 4,000 in town and 9,000 in our zip code. Come on by and get to know us!
