Mayor Mark McBrayer
-------------------

Mark W. McBrayer was elected to serve as the 37th Mayor of Lubbock in June 2024 after proudly representing District 3 on the Lubbock City Council for two years.

Mark is an ordained Baptist minister. He also owned and operated several local businesses for 17 years before going to law school at Texas Tech University at the age of 47, where he graduated Magna Cum Laude. Mark has been a practicing attorney for the past 22 years, serving of counsel to the law firm of Crenshaw, Dupree and Milam.

Mark has lived in the Tech Terrace Neighborhood almost all his life. He learned the values he lives by today from his church, his parents, and his community. He was educated in Lubbock public schools and at Texas Tech. He and his wife of 41 years, Cindy, are proud Red Raiders. Lubbock is not only his home, it is his passion.

Cindy was a French teacher in Lubbock public schools for 29 years, and she now works with international students through the Baptist Student Ministry at Texas Tech. Mark and Cindy’s daughter, Whitney, is a local dentist, and their son, Bryant, served his country as a Navy Seal before coming back to Lubbock, where he and his wife, Carmell, are both teachers. Mark and Cindy have two grandchildren.

As Mayor, Mark’s focus is on controlling spending in order to keep taxes low, lowering the City’s current debt, prioritizing citizen safety and essential services, supporting police and fire, maintaining streets and critical infrastructure, enforcing city codes, and reducing regulations on businesses. He is committed to greater transparency and accountability in city government. Mark’s ultimate goal is to work with the City Council to keep Lubbock an attractive place to raise a family, work or start a business, and enjoy life.
