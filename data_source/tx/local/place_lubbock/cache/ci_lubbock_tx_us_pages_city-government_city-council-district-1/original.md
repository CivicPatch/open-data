Christy Martinez-Garcia, District 1
-----------------------------------

Christy Martinez-Garcia was elected to the Lubbock City Council, District 1, in May 2022 and was appointed Mayor Pro Tem in 2024.

Mrs. Martinez-Garcia is the founder and publisher of *Latino Lubbock Magazine*, which has been in print for more than 15 years. The magazine serves as a tool to provide Lubbock news from a Latino perspective and offers information of interest to the Hispanic community, especially for bilingual and Spanish speaking citizens.

She grew up in Lubbock and graduated from Lubbock High School before she went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Public Relations and Marketing from Texas Tech University.

Prior to turning her attention to *Latino Lubbock*, Mrs. Martinez-Garcia worked at the City of Lubbock as a Public Information Officer and the National Council of La Raza in Washington, D.C. as the Assistant Director of Public Information. She also hosts a Latino Lubbock Update segment on *KLBK’*s “Trends & Friends.”

Mrs. Martinez-Garcia is very passionate about her community and is involved in several boards and organizations. She serves on the board of the National Association of Hispanic Publications, and is the founder of Los Hermanos Familia, a nonprofit organization working to “Strengthen Families, Build Community.” A popular event hosted by Los Hermanos Familia is the annual “Vamos a Pescar, Let’s Go Fishing” that teaches Lubbock youth about the art of fishing, while simultaneously creating an event for families to enjoy together. This event is free of charge, and involves almost 5,000 participants.

Mrs. Martinez-Garcia has led many efforts to better her community such as the development and planning of the gateway art project on University Avenue and 3rd Street and was central in renaming Canyon Lake Dr. in memorial of Cesar E. Chavez.

She is the recipient of numerous awards that include the Senator Robert L. Duncan Community Champion Award, Latina Publisher of the Year by the NAHP, 2009 Women in Small Business Champion for the SBA Northwest, and most recently, the 2024 Public Official of the Year from the Lubbock Classroom Teachers Association.

Mrs. Martinez-Garcia is very passionate about Lubbock’s Junior Ambassador Program with our Sister City, Musashino City, in Japan. Mrs. Martinez-Garcia hosted Junior Ambassadors from Japan on five different occasions, and now on the Lubbock City Council, she had the honor of visiting Musashino City in 2023 as our lead delegate.

Mrs. Martinez-Garcia has been married to her husband, Frank Garcia, for more than 30 years. Their daughter, Amaris Garcia, has followed her mother’s example and earned a degree in PR and Marketing. In 2013, Christy and Frank were selected as the Texas Tech Parents of the Year.
