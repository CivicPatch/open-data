**My name is Haley Maywald and I am the Deputy City Secretary/Finance Officer for the City of George West. I moved to George West, from Del Rio, TX, in June of 2018 with my husband and our four children. I was hired by the city in November of 2018 and have stepped in to help many departments of the city. I enjoy helping people and will do what I can to lighten the load that other people carry. My favorite thing to do is travel our beautiful county by car. My husband and I make it a point to do one big trip each year.**
