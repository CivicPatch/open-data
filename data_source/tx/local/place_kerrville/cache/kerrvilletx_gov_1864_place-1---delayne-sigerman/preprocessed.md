Delayne Sigerman, a native of Houston, spent 25 years in Miami before returning to her home state in 2007. She had a successful real estate career in Florida, working initially with Grubb & Ellis and later with a local developer. She specialized in leasing office and warehouse space, as well as facilitating the sale of retail land in a mixed-use project near the Miami airport.

Since returning to Texas, Delayne has been actively engaged in the Kerrville community. She served on the Playhouse 2000 board, which oversees the Cailloux Theater, and was a member of the Economic Improvement Corporation Board from 2015 to 2017. She served on Kerrville’s City Council from 2018 to 2020 and later served as president of the Doyle Community Board from 2020 to 2023. Her volunteer work spans various areas, including supporting the homeless community, animal welfare with Kerrville Pets Alive, early childhood education with Headstart, and fostering artistic expression through the Hill Country Choral.

In her personal life, Delayne enjoys culinary pursuits, playing the piano, attempting to master golf, and cherishing time with her family.
