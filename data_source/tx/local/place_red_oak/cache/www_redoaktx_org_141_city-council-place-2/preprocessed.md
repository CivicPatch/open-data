Sean Flannery serves as the Red Oak City Councilman for Place 2. A resident of Red Oak, Texas since his retirement from the United States Marine Corps in August 2020, Councilman Flannery brings over 25 years of distinguished military leadership and a lifelong commitment to public service.

Born in Southfield, Michigan, in 1974, Councilman Flannery also lived in Memphis, Tennessee, and Corbin, Kentucky, before moving to Fort Worth, Texas, in 1988. He married his wife, Sharon, in Fort Worth in 1992, and the couple lived in Arlington, Texas, before he joined the Marine Corps in 1995.

Councilman Flannery served as an enlisted infantryman for 16 years before accepting a commission as a Marine Gunner—an Infantry Weapons Officer—where he provided expert-level guidance on weapons systems, training, and operational planning. Throughout his career, he served overseas for four years and deployed seven times, including three combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. He held senior leadership roles at U.S. embassies and in key training and readiness positions across the Marine Corps.

Following his military service, Councilman Flannery remained active in the Red Oak community as a business owner focused on business development, operational planning, and training. He has served on the Board of Directors for the Marine Gunner Association since October 2023, continuing his dedication to the veteran community.

He holds a Master of Business Administration (MBA) in Strategic Leadership from New England College and a Bachelor of Science in Legal Studies. As a member of the City Council, Councilman Flannery is committed to smart, responsible governance, protecting individual liberties, and setting the conditions for future generations to prosper. He champions transparency, fiscal discipline, and collaborative leadership to support Red Oak’s continued growth and success.
