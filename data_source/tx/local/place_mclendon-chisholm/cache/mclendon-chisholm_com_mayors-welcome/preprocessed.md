### MAYOR BRYAN McNEAL

[mayor@mclendon-chisholm.com](mailto:mayor@mclendon-chisholm.com)

> The greatest asset of McLendon Chisholm is the community, our citizens. People talk to each other, help each other and band together when needed.

McLendon Chisholm is the gem of Rockwall County. We are one of the few cities that can still grow. We have a lot of available land and our growth will be managed with thoughtful insights from our leadership and citizens.

McLendon Chisholm is and will continue to be a mix of upscale homes with a rural community feel, incorporating professional businesses along the 205 corridor that benefit our community as a whole.

Thank you all for the opportunity to serve you as your Mayor. It is a true honor.

*Mayor Bryan McNeal*
