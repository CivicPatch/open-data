Anthony Kendrick was elected to represent District 4 of Killeen on May 3, 2025, and sworn in on May 13, 2025. He advocates for equitable infrastructure, market development, youth engagement, transparency, and public safety.

Kendrick mentors local teenagers, supports small businesses, and engages with residents through neighborhood visits, city department ride-alongs, and community clean-ups.

Originally from Sylvester, Georgia, and raised in Tampa, Florida, he enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1988 as an Armor Crewman and served 21 years, completing multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as humanitarian missions. After retirement, he managed aviation fuel logistics in the Middle East.

As a community leader, Kendrick previously owned a Youth Sports Association and is the Central Texas Regional Director for Texas Youth Football All-Star. He is also involved with the Killeen Independent School District’s mentorship programs and health advisory council. A Killeen resident for over 25 years, his leadership has inspired many young men to achieve their goals.
