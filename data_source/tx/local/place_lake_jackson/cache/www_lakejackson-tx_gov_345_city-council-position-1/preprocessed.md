Mr. Schooler graduated from UT Austin in 1976 with a BS in Chemical Engineering. In 1979, he graduated from Corpus Christi State with an MBA (focus on finance). Mr. Schooler worked for Reynolds Metals Company for 9 years, both domestically and abroad. In 1985, he joined BASF in Freeport.

Later, Mr. Schooler received BASF’s Innovation Award for Safety Concepts he developed, which not only improved safety at BASF, but also improved safety for the rest of the chemical and refining industry. He has been a frequent speaker on safety and leadership concepts at professional organizations and universities for many years. After retiring from BASF in 2017, he joined Pilko & Associates on a part-time basis, assisting companies in enhancing safety, leadership, and incident investigations.
