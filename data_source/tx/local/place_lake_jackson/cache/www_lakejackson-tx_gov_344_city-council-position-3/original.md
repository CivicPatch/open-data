Rhonda Seth, City Council Position 3
====================================

**Personal History**
--------------------

A lifelong resident of Brazoria County, Councilmember Seth is a 1995 graduate of Angleton High School.  At the age of 21 Councilmember Seth moved to Lake Jackson where she became a young entrepreneur, spending the next 15 years, as a co-owner of Martial Arts America, a Taekwondo school. During this time, she also earned her 4th degree Black Belt and competed internationally on the US Women’s Taekwondo Team.

In 2009, valuing self-reliance and determination, Councilmember Seth decided to put herself through nursing school, where she graduated with honors, and ultimately became a Registered Nurse. For over a decade, Councilmember Seth has been serving our community in a local Emergency Department and has been a credible ally for quality healthcare in the region.

When she is not working, Councilmember Seth and her husband Thomas, who is also a lifelong resident of Brazoria County, are busy raising their two young sons, Jax and Finn, here in Lake Jackson.

**Community Involvement**
-------------------------

In 2021, Councilmember Seth was elected to City Council, and is currently serving as the Council Liaison to both the Charter Review Committee and the EMS Board.

Councilmember Seth describes herself as an independent conservative and believes that her strong principles and common-sense approach to decision-making will serve our community well.
