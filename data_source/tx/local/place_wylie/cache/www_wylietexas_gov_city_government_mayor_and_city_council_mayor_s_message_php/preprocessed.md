Downtown Wylie is also home to numerous historic landmarks and buildings featuring Victorian and Craftsman architecture.

Wylie hosts many community events throughout the year including the 500 Pedal Car Race, Bluegrass on Ballard, Wylie Arts Festival, the Chamber of Commerce rodeo, and our annual Christmas parade and tree lighting. Lavon Lake and Lake Ray Hubbard are nestled around the city providing excellent opportunities for enjoying the outdoors.

Wylie has been named Best Place to Live and Best Place to Raise a Family in the U.S., and is known as one of the safest communities in the country. Wylie ISD is an award-winning school district that offers exceptional programs for all students. Wylie Fire Rescue boasts the top ISO 1 rating, our police department is recognized for their outstanding work in our community, and our parks and recreation facilities offer opportunities for citizens to get out and be active!
