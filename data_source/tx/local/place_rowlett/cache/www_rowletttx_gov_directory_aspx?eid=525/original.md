Jonathan Reaves is a native Texan, raised in Garland. Jonathan and his wife Stacy have been residents of Rowlett for over 20 years. They have 3 children who have called Rowlett home their![](https://www.rowletttx.gov/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=32372) entire lives. His oldest child is active in college life and his two youngest are elementary students. Jonathan is a volunteer coach for his daughter’s basketball team and has been an active member of his church.

Jonathan graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in business from Colorado Christian University in 1999. Starting his career in financial services, he quickly moved to insurance consulting. For over 20 years he consulted on employee benefit plans and became an expert at self-funded, stop loss contracts. In 2013, he and a business partner bought an insurance agency and turned it into a premier local consulting firm. From 2013 to 2018, he drove business development, sales, and overall strategy and grew the firm by over 400%. In 2018, he sold his firm to a large, national brokerage/consulting company and went on to work for that company in a leadership position for the following four years. During his tenure with that company, he managed the north Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas operations. In addition to being the Managing Principal, Jonathan also led his office in new business sales and managed the largest book of client revenue among his operations.

Throughout his career, Jonathan became highly skilled in contract and price negotiation, budget management and strategy, client service, servant leadership, and personnel management. Jonathan understands that people are the key to making progress, and he has always strived to set people up for success.

Since 2022, Jonathan is self-employed as a stock day trader.

Jonathan is a strong advocate for economic development, believing it will benefit residents, such as revamping downtown with more entertainment and shopping options. In addition, he supports a robust public safety department to meet the needs of our growing population. Jonathan is committed to representing Rowlett in a manner that will benefit current and future residents.
