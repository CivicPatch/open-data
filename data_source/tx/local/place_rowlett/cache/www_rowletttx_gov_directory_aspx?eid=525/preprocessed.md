From 2013 to 2018, he drove business development, sales, and overall strategy and grew the firm by over 400%. In 2018, he sold his firm to a large, national brokerage/consulting company and went on to work for that company in a leadership position for the following four years. During his tenure with that company, he managed the north Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas operations. In addition to being the Managing Principal, Jonathan also led his office in new business sales and managed the largest book of client revenue among his operations.

Since 2022, Jonathan is self-employed as a stock day trader.
