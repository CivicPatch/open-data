Elise originally moved to Rowlett in 1972. After graduating from Alaska Pacific University in her late 20s, she started sailing and lived aboard small sailboats until her late forties. She sailed 12,000 offshore miles on both of North America's coasts.
Elise started her career in government service at Naval Air Station Key West in 2007, working with a diverse population of sailors, contractors, and retirees in Morale Welfare and Recreation. In 2012, Elise and her husband Bruce, a retired US Marine Corps Major, moved back to Rowlett. She joined the Rowlett Parks and Recreation Department in 2014, and she helped manage the building of the new Kids Kingdom Playground. From serving on the committee to hammering nails, to the grand opening and beyond, building Kids Kingdom was an adventure like none other.

She joined the City Manager's Office in 2016 as the Neighborhood Life Coordinator.  She designed programming to help educate and connect people across the City.  Elise worked with local organizations like Keep Rowlett Beautiful, the Rowlett Chamber of Commerce, and the Garland Independent School District.  Her main goals were to educate Rowlett residents about their local government, connect neighbors to neighbors and help local non-profits realize their goals.

After retiring in 2021, Elise joined the Rowlett Parks and Recreation Board and served as the 2022 Charter Review Commission Chair.  Acting on these two Boards inspired her to continue her life in public service as a City Councilmember.
