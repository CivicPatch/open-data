![](https://www.rowletttx.gov/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=32371)John P. Bowers III has called Rowlett home for nearly his entire life. Moving to the city at just two years old, he grew up immersed in the values of family, faith, and community that continue to shape his leadership today. A proud graduate of Rowlett High School, John’s early years were filled with meaningful engagement—from youth basketball leagues at the Rowlett Community Centre to deep connections with neighbors and mentors that inspired a lifelong commitment to public service.

After high school, John pursued a degree in economics and political science at Morehouse College, where he was elected the 88th Student Body President. His leadership focused on student advocacy, collaboration, and driving institutional progress. He later earned an MBA in Strategy from Southern Methodist University’s Cox School of Business, sharpening the problem-solving and policy acumen he now brings back to his hometown.

John’s professional path reflects his passion for mentorship, innovation, and service. As a Senior associate in finance, he helps lead global workforce development initiatives and champions military spouse and veteran mentorship. He has served as a leadership development ambassador and was selected for the Dana Juett Residency with Social Venture Partners Dallas, collaborating on projects that tackle critical social challenges. As a former professor at Spelman College and volunteer with the nonprofit Braven, John has empowered young professionals to reach their full potential—passing on the tools, strategy, and confidence needed to thrive.

While having professional success across industries and cities, John’s heart never left Rowlett. He returned with purpose—to give back to the city that shaped him. From leading a major food banking initiative that delivered over 7,000 meals to supporting local nonprofits like Hope in Hand, John has never wavered in his belief that true leadership means listening, acting, and lifting others. Today, you’ll find him talking with neighbors at LA Fitness or strategizing with community partners, always focused on how to move Rowlett forward.

Inspired by his mother, State Representative Rhetta Andrews Bowers, and grounded in his faith through service at St. Luke Community United Methodist Church, John is running for Rowlett City Council to restore trust in local leadership, protect the city’s character, and deliver real results for residents. From smart public safety investment to responsible housing policy and infrastructure reform, John is committed to ensuring Rowlett thrives for generations to come.
