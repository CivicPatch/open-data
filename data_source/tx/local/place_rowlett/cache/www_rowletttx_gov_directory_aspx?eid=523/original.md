![](https://www.rowletttx.gov/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=32375)Mike Britton is a native-born Texan, who was raised in a small West Texas farming community. Mike has been a resident of Rowlett since 2018, relocating here after living in Allen, TX for the previous 18 years. Mike has been married for 49 years to his wife, Rachael (celebrating his 50th anniversary in June 2022). He has two adult children and nine grandchildren.

Mike has enjoyed three distinct careers in his life. First, he honorably served as a U.S. Marine for twenty years, retiring at the rank of Master Sergeant. He went on to enjoy a successful career in the telecommunications industry as a Senior Manager for MCI’s internal data and voice network. He finished his professional career in the security industry as the Director of Healthcare Security for North Texas.

Mike is a graduate of the Rowlett Citizens Academy in 2019. He is actively engaged in volunteer/ministry work in his church at First Baptist Rowlett, with particular emphasis on volunteering outside the walls of the church in after-school activities at Coyle Middle, as well as Pearson Elementary. These activities center around engaging and reaching troubled teens and children, who are often from homes without one or both parents. He is also involved in a faith-based ministry called Men of Honor and Ladies of Honor. As part of the Men of Honor program he collaborates with high school young men from Rowlett High School as a guide, mentor, and encourager for these young men to learn about biblical manhood. He also serves his church as an active Deacon and bible study teacher.

Mike is a strong advocate for Rowlett’s public safety organizations and believes that our continual growth demands that we not only acquire but retain the best, professional men, and women to keep us safe. He wants to see Rowlett’s business and commercial activities flourish, especially our locally owned businesses. He also believes that the Council must function as good stewards of the resources it commits on behalf of and for the benefit of our citizens.
