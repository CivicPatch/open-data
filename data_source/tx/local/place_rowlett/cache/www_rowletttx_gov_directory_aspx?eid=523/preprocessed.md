He finished his professional career in the security industry as the Director of Healthcare Security for North Texas.

Mike is a graduate of the Rowlett Citizens Academy in 2019. He is actively engaged in volunteer/ministry work in his church at First Baptist Rowlett, with particular emphasis on volunteering outside the walls of the church in after-school activities at Coyle Middle, as well as Pearson Elementary. These activities center around engaging and reaching troubled teens and children, who are often from homes without one or both parents. He is also involved in a faith-based ministry called Men of Honor and Ladies of Honor. As part of the Men of Honor program he collaborates with high school young men from Rowlett High School as a guide, mentor, and encourager for these young men to learn about biblical manhood.
