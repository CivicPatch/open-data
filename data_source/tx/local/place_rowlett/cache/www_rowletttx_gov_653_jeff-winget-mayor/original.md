![](https://www.rowletttx.gov/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=32370)Jeff Winget was elected as Mayor in May 2025 after serving the citizens of Rowlett as Councilmember Place 2 for three years. A native of Mesquite, he has been a resident of Rowlett since 2014, having relocated with his family from Arlington after outgrowing their home.  Jeff immediately engaged in a variety of volunteer opportunities with multiple organizations and is often found behind the lens of a camera. He has been married to Elaina since 2006, and they have four children.

Jeff received his Master of Business Analytics, with a minor in Cybersecurity, from Texas A&M University-Commerce, his Bachelor of Business Administration in Accounting from the University of Texas at Arlington, and his Associate of Arts from Tarrant County College. In his professional life,  Jeff serves as Director of Finance and Administration, specializing in financial analysis, data modeling, business intelligence, and strategic execution.

Prior to being elected, Jeff served seven years with the Arts and Humanities Commission, three of those years as chair. Additionally, he chaired the 2020 Rowlett Charter Review Commission and served on the 2018 Strategic Plan Steering Committee. Outside of municipal service, Jeff has also served as President, Vice President, and Treasurer on the board of multiple PTAs and Booster Clubs, and serves on the leadership board at Christ the Redeemer Anglican Church, where he and his family have been members for over 15 years.

In his time in Rowlett, Jeff has been awarded the *Big ‘R’ Pacesetter* award in 2023 and the *Spirit of Rowlett* award in 2018.

Some of Jeff’s objectives through his service on City Council include improving citizen involvement, providing the necessary resources for an effective public safety presence, ensuring consistent and well-planned infrastructure repair and development, and visioning future development that is both smart and sustainable.
