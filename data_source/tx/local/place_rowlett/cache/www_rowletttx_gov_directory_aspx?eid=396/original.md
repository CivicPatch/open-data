Marvin Gibbs is a native Texan, born and raised in Garland, Texas.  Marvin and his wife Kendra moved to Rowlett in September of 1988, ![](https://www.rowletttx.gov/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=32373)when they bought their first home. Marvin was a Rowlett Police Officer and Kendra a Garland Police Department Communications Supervisor, both just beginning their careers. Shortly after making Rowlett their home, they started their family with the birth of their first born and shortly thereafter, their second child. As soon as their children could hit or kick a ball, they began playing youth sports in Rowlett. The Gibbs’ family remained very active in the youth sports up to the graduations of both of their children from Rowlett High School.  The oldest of the two children went on to play college soccer at Lamar University where she earned her Bachelor’s Degree.   The youngest went to Texas Tech University where he earned his Bachelor’s Degree.

Marvin focused on his career at the Rowlett Police Department and earned the rank of Lieutenant and served as Interim Assistant Chief of Police. During Marvin’s Police Career he was the Commander over several Divisions within the police department and police specialties. Marvin was a Patrol Commander, Traffic Commander and a Community Services Division Commander.

In 2009 during the recession, the City of Rowlett experienced budget shortfalls which led to reductions in the City’s workforce. As a result, the City Manager decided to move the Code Enforcement, Animal Control, Health Department, and the City Trash Contract all under Marvin’s Command within the Community Services Division of the Police Department.

During Marvin’s tenure as the Police Commander of the Community Services Division, he managed two trash contracts and oversaw two requests for proposals for trash contracts. Created new partnerships to put a stop the euthanasia of animals for space at the Rowlett Animal Shelter, to a successful program of maintaining a 98% Live Release Rate for all animals.

Following the 2015 tornado, he led in the response/recovery/cleanup efforts. Being the Commander of the School Resource Officers was one of Marvin’s proudest achievements partnering with GISD and the officers implementing new policies and procedures to keep both the students and staff safe, while maintaining a productive learning environment.

Commander over the Rowlett Health Department which partnered with the Dallas County Health Department fighting the West Nile Virus with the Trapping/Testing of mosquitos and Ground/Aerial spraying.

Commander over the Community Services Officers who orchestrated the yearly National Night out and Neighborhood Crime Watch Groups set records with the number of active crime watch groups in Rowlett, with Rowlett being named as one of the Safest Cities in Texas several times.  Neighbors watching out for neighbors.

Marvin retired from the Rowlett Police Department on January 31, 2025, with over 36 years of honorable service to police department and the citizens of Rowlett.
