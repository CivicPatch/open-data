Marvin Gibbs is a native Texan, born and raised in Garland, Texas.  Marvin and his wife Kendra moved to Rowlett in September of 1988,

when they bought their first home. Marvin was a Rowlett Police Officer and Kendra a Garland Police Department Communications Supervisor, both just beginning their careers. Shortly after making Rowlett their home, they started their family with the birth of their first born and shortly thereafter, their second child. As soon as their children could hit or kick a ball, they began playing youth sports in Rowlett. The Gibbs’ family remained very active in the youth sports up to the graduations of both of their children from Rowlett High School.  The oldest of the two children went on to play college soccer at Lamar University where she earned her Bachelor’s Degree.   The youngest went to Texas Tech University where he earned his Bachelor’s Degree.

In 2009 during the recession, the City of Rowlett experienced budget shortfalls which led to reductions in the City’s workforce. As a result, the City Manager decided to move the Code Enforcement, Animal Control, Health Department, and the City Trash Contract all under Marvin’s Command within the Community Services Division of the Police Department.

Marvin retired from the Rowlett Police Department on January 31, 2025, with over 36 years of honorable service to police department and the citizens of Rowlett.
