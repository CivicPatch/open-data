Mayor's Office of Economic Development
--------------------------------------



1. Mayor's Office of Economic Development

Thank you for visiting the Mayor’s Office of Economic Development. Under the leadership of Mayor John Whitmire, the Chief Development Officer and staff develop, implement, and manage citywide policies and procedures for encouraging and attracting growth to make Houston even more of the metropolitan city that it is.

The Economic Development Division is dedicated to promoting City initiatives and economic tools to business owners interested in relocating or expanding their companies in the City of Houston. This division coordinates a myriad of economic development incentives with businesses worldwide. We seek to help qualified companies grow their business through expansion in our City. Our strategy involves building on the City's strengths to promote existing businesses and retain jobs, to facilitate business expansion, and recruit new businesses and related employment to the City. Business recruitment is very competitive, and as such, we partner with the State of Texas Office of Economic Development, Harris County, the Greater Houston Partnership, the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership, and a multitude of other economic development organizations to ensure your company utilizes the appropriate incentives to help grow your business in Houston.

Below are links to the different economic incentive programs we manage:
