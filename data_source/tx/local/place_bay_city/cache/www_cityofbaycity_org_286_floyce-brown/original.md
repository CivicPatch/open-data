Councilman Ben Flores

Benjamin Flores, City Council Member - Position 1
-------------------------------------------------

Email: [bflores@cityofbaycity.org](mailto:bflores@cityofbaycity.org)

Benjamin Flores arrived in the United States in 1996 with two small bags and a big dream. Having studied English in Mexico, Flores was determined to seize every opportunity. After arriving in California, he washed cars, fried chicken at a KFC, and worked nights at a Marriott hotel. Marriott taught him the value of always providing great service. They also allowed him to tinker with their back-office computers, launching his thirty-year career in cybersecurity. Today, he holds multiple industry certifications and works protecting data in banking, fintech, managed-service providers, pharmaceuticals, and county governments.

After their daughter Nadia was born, he and his wife An Huynh looked for a state that prized freedom, opportunity and personal responsibility. Texas fit the bill. They moved to Austin in 2016 before settling in Bay City several years later. Today, outside their professional careers, they raise heritage-breed pigs together on their small homestead and fight for the constitutional rights of Texas’ farmers and ranchers.

Flores currently serves on Bay City’s City Council, the board of the Bay City Development Corporation, and represents his city at the Houston-Galveston Area Council. He is an elder at Bay City’s First Presbyterian Church where he oversees Christian education. Though Nadia attends Holy Cross Catholic School, Benjamin is a vocal supporter of strong public schools because great classrooms lift every Texas child.

Trained in disaster response as a CERT volunteer, he’s always ready to respond to the next big storm. In his spare time, he swings kettlebells, perfects his brisket, studies French, tinkers with open‑source tech projects, looks after his pigs, and builds almost anything from scratch.

### Term

Councilman Flores was first elected to City Council in 2023
