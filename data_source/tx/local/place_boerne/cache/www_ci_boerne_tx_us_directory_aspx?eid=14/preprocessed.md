Ty Wolosin
==========

[City Council & Mayor](https://www.ci.boerne.tx.us/Directory.aspx?DID=6)
Title: Council District 1 | Mayor Pro Tem
[Email Ty Wolosin](mailto:twolosin@boerne-tx.gov)

Councilman Wolosin's term expires in 2026.

After earning a Bachelor of Science degree and a Master’s degree in Geography, Ty Wolosin returned to Texas to take over operations at his family’s 100-acre ranch and farm located outside of Comanche, Texas. From farming and ranching came Windy Hill Foods, a sustainable meat distribution company that continues today in Boerne and recently celebrated 11 years in business. After relocating to Boerne, Ty was approached by his in-laws about starting a brewery. So came Cibolo Creek Brewing Co., a brewpub located on the Hill Country Mile in Boerne’s historic downtown. Ty handles all the production of beer as well as being an integral part of menu development and growth strategies.

Ty was first appointed to Boerne City Council in December 2018. His focus is on quality of life, mobility, concerns of citizens, a unified development code, and fiscal responsibility, to name a few. His hopes are that his unique background will help in achieving those goals. For his family, businesses, and community, Ty wants to help shape the Boerne our residents desire.

Ty is married to Meg, whose family has lived in the Boerne/Fair Oaks Ranch area for about 25 years. They have two young daughters, Clementine and Rosalyn.
