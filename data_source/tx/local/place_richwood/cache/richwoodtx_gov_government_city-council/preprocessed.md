[Guide to Becoming a City Official](https://www.tml.org/DocumentCenter/View/1249/FINAL-2019-A-Guide-to-Becoming-a-City-Official)

The Mayor and City Council have regular City Council meetings on the second Monday of each month at 6:00 p.m. in the City Hall Council Chambers, located at 1800 Brazosport Blvd N, Richwood, Texas; unless otherwise adopted by a majority of City Council. All meetings are open to the public unless specified as an Executive Session. A quorum is required.

City Council has adopted a policy providing guidelines to allow for public comment during regularly scheduled meetings. Citizens are given the opportunity to give public comment at regular City Council meetings. Comments are limited to 3 minutes. Due to the Open Meetings Act, members of Council are not allowed to respond or take part in any discussion related to the comments made. If more than one citizen wishes to address city council on the same subject matter, individuals are encouraged to select a spokesperson for the group.
