The Board of Adjustments’ role in the zoning process is limited in comparison with the Plan Commission and City Council. The Board, unlike the Commission and Council, does not have the authority to change the zoning ordinance or the zoning on a particular piece of property. Instead, the Board of Adjustments is empowered to grant relief from certain provisions in the zoning ordinance where literal compliance would result in unnecessary hardship. The Board serves in what the law calls a “quasi-judicial” capacity, that is, the Board is somewhat like a panel of judges. The decision of the Board of Adjustments must be based solely upon the evidence presented to the Board at the hearing on a request before the Board. The decision of the Board is, thus, more of a judicial, as opposed to a legislative, function – assessing and weighing the facts of a particular case rather than determining generally applicable policy and making law.

Roloff Park
-----------

The improvements to Roloff Park are complete. The Town spent over $1 million, using the 2011 Certificates of Obligation funds, to make major improvements to this park. A cover basketball court was added along with new playground sets; two pavilions, jogging/walking trail, exercise stations, a resurfaced parking lot for City Hall; irrigation system; and new signage.

Residents wanting to use Roloff Park for birthday parties and/or family events can print a

The Veterans Park on FM 510 is now complete. It includes engraved brick pavers along with five American flags. The Town Council recently declared Veterans Park to be a non-public park, meaning that it can only be used for veteran-related activities such as Veterans Day and Memorial Day.
