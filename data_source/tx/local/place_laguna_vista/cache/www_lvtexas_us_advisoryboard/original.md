Laguna Vista Advisory Boards
----------------------------

Board of Adjustments

CDC

Ethics Board

Library Board

Parks and Recreation

Planning and Zoning

The Board of Adjustments is a body whose existence and jurisdiction are established by the state zoning enabling act. Hence, the Board of Adjustments is an entity recognized by state law and not merely a creature of local ordinance.

The Board of Adjustments’ role in the zoning process is limited in comparison with the Plan Commission and City Council. The Board, unlike the Commission and Council, does not have the authority to change the zoning ordinance or the zoning on a particular piece of property. Instead, the Board of Adjustments is empowered to grant relief from certain provisions in the zoning ordinance where literal compliance would result in unnecessary hardship. The Board serves in what the law calls a “quasi-judicial” capacity, that is, the Board is somewhat like a panel of judges. The decision of the Board of Adjustments must be based solely upon the evidence presented to the Board at the hearing on a request before the Board. The decision of the Board is, thus, more of a judicial, as opposed to a legislative, function – assessing and weighing the facts of a particular case rather than determining generally applicable policy and making law.

COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION (CDC)

The Community Development Corporation (CDC) Board consists of 7 members appointed by the Town Council, with the Mayor serving as an Ex-Officio member. The CDC Board oversees community and economic development activities of the Town. The CDC Board is advisory in nature. Its recommendation for funding is acted upon by the Town Council.

The CDC funds are primarily used for brick-and-mortar projects in the community from park improvements to development projects. Less than 10% of the CDC funds are used for promotional purposes.

The Town collects 1.5% of sales taxes revenues in Laguna Vista. Of this percentage collected, half a cent goes to the Community Development Corporation.

The CDC Board meets THE FIRST Monday of the month at 6pm at Town Hall, located at 122 Fernandez Street.

If you are interested in the CDC Board considering your request for funding, download and complete a [CDC APPLICATION](http://www.lvtexas.com/pdfs/CDCfundingapplication.pdf) and submit it either to the City Secretary or the General Manager.
