Message from the Mayor
----------------------

On behalf of the Town Council, I welcome you to the beautiful Town of Laguna Vista, Texas, a beautiful community to live, work, and play. I am thrilled that you have taken the time to view our official Website.

​

We have much to offer. We are considered a bedroom community located at the intersection of Highway 100 and FM 510. We're a 20-minute drive to South Padre Island and a 10-minute drive to Port Isabel. We're also a short drive to Brownsville and Harlingen with close proximity to top-notch medical facilities, hospitals, and services for veterans.

​

Laguna Vista is known for its scenic beauty, picturesque sunsets, and an "easy-paced" lifestyle. We are a quiet and friendly community with an affordable cost-of-living and an array of recreational opportunities that include playing golf, bay and deep-sea fishing, kayaking, windsurfing, and kite-boarding. We are actually located at the center and heart or "Corazon" of the entire Laguna Madre area.

​

In recent years, the Town has invested heavily in its local parks that are second-to-none and that are envied by many other communities. We have beautiful Roloff Park, Veterans Park, and a beautiful nature trail—all created for the enjoyment of all residents of all ages.

​

We are also home to the South Padre Island Golf Club, a 1,800 acre gated community of homes, townhomes, villas and casitas and includes an 18-hole championship golf course. The course offers a breathtaking view of the bay and of South Padre Island.

​

Again, thank you for viewing our Website. We hope that you consider making Laguna Vista your home for a day, a month, or a lifetime.
