Our Mission Statement
---------------------

Laguna Vista Public Library endeavors to develop collections, resources and services to meet the cultural, informational, recreational, and educational needs and enhance and increase the personal productivity of the members of the diverse community.

​

From a one room Public Library, about the size of a dorm room, to a beautiful freestanding building with a view of the bay, the Laguna Vista Public Library is the one attraction that a small town has to offer. Not nearly a few years in the new building, no one can imagine how the residents of Laguna Vista managed in the small room for so many years. The building is slowly filling with wall-to-wall books and computers for everyone to use. The voices of parents reading to their children fill the air and the hominess of the furnishings appeals to every person that walks through the double glass doors.

​

Like all other public libraries, Laguna Vista has the honor of hosting the cocoon of so many children's imaginations through materials and technology. The demand for learning is stronger now then ever and the Laguna Vista Public Library is here to help all those Children's Dreams come true

Goals & 
Standards
------------------

We endeavor to develop collections, resources and services to meet the cultural, informational, recreational, and educational needs of our diverse community.

If there is something missing that you'd like to see, please contact us and let us know how we can better serve you.
