Local government is a key platform for political participation, where citizens can actively engage in decision-making processes. Elections for local bodies, such as city councils or municipal boards and commissions, provide an opportunity for residents to choose representatives who will advocate for their interests and concerns. The concept of local democracy ensures that governance is more accessible and responsive to local needs.
