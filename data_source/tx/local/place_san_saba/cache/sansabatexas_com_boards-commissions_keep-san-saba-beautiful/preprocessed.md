Keep San Saba Beautiful
=======================

One of the many amazing things about San Saba is the abundance of scenic areas from downtown flowers and historic buildings to our spacious parks. It is thanks in part to the efforts of our community leaders and volunteers that we are able to enjoy such spaces! Keep San Saba Beautiful (KSSB) is a local organization that has been hard at work in the city since its inception in 2009. In 2021, the organization was recognized as one of 10 winners of the coveted Keep Texas Beautiful’s Governor’s Community Achievement Awards for outstanding community improvement!
