The City of College Station operates under a council-manager form of government. The city council is composed of the mayor and six councilmembers elected at large. The mayor is the council's presiding officer and is recognized as the head of the city government for ceremonial purposes. The mayor is entitled to vote on all matters under consideration by the council. The council shall elect a mayor pro tem from its membership who acts as mayor during the mayor's absence or disability.
The mayor and each council member will hold office for four years (the transition from three-year to four-year terms will be completed for all council positions by 2024) until his or her successor is elected and qualified. No person shall be deemed elected to an office unless that person receives a majority of all the votes cast.
The mayor and each council member must be a citizen of the United States, a qualified voter of the state of Texas, and have resided for at least one year within the corporate limits of College Station.
The city council has the power to appoint the city manager, adopt the budget, authorize the issuance of bonds, and name members of commissions and boards. The city council also establishes policies regarding zoning, parks, master greenway plan and development of yearly strategic issues.

Meetings are generally held on the second and fourth Thursday of each month in the Council Chambers at College Station City Hall, located at 1101 Texas Ave. For a complete list of City of College Station events and meetings, visit
