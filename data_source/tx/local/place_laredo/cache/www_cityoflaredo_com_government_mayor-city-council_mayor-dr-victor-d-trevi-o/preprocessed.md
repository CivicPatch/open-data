Dr. Treviño is a product and a son of Laredo. Being born and raised in Laredo, Texas, he is a descendant of Capt. Tomas Sanchez (Founder of Laredo), and product of the public school system, attending Nixon high school, where he graduated in 1966. Dr. Treviño attended Laredo Junior College and Texas A&M University at Kingsville before going to medical school in Coahuila, Mexico. After finishing his residency in 1984 at LSU Charity Hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana, Dr. Treviño attained medical licenses in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama and Mexico.

Understanding the medical need that existed in his hometown, and encouraged by family members, like his father Raul Treviño, and the late Dr. Murray Malakoff, he returned to his hometown in 1985 were he immediately started working with the City of Laredo Health Department, and in Family Medicine and Obstetrics. Always having a passion in helping the medically underserved community, Dr. Treviño has served in several roles over the last 35 years. As medical director of the health department, he oversaw the no-cost Maternity clinics, STD clinics, and various other public health programs. Dr. Treviño has also served as the medical director of Retama West Nursing home and Director of the Skilled Nursing Unit at LMC. He also continues to hold privileges at Doctors Hospital, Laredo Medical Center, and Specialty Hospital where he has served in several leadership capacities as Department Chair and Chief of Staff.

Most recently Dr. Treviño served as the Health Authority for the City of Laredo where he guided the City through the Global Covid pandemic. Understanding the international dynamics and vulnerability of the community to Covid, Dr. Treviño helped create a pilot binational vaccination program with Mexican bordering communities like Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas and Colombia, Nuevo Leon. The vaccination program which is still underway has had great success, and is nearing 300,000 vaccines administered. This has greatly reduced the level of hospitalizations and death on both sides of the border and has resulted in Laredo and Nuevo Laredo as two of the most vaccinated municipalities in the United States and Mexico.

Dr. Treviño continues to believe that any challenge can be met and resolved, as long as people work together with leadership, integrity and transparency. This is the reason why he feels privileged and an honored to work in public health, and in service to the community.
