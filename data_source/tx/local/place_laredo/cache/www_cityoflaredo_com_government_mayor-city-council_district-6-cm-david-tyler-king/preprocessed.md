Welcome to District VI
----------------------

Welcome and thank you for visiting the District 6 homepage. My name is Dr. Tyler King, and it's an honor to represent you on the Laredo City Council.

District 6 covers the vast majority of North and Northeast Laredo east of IH35 and the district is anchored by the jewel of District 6, North Central Park. This wonderful park has a network of trails, playground, a pool complex, reflection pond and even a new disc golf course for you to enjoy.

I am very proud to present this website where you will find the latest events and projects in our district, all of which are meant to make life better for you and your family. It is my mission to remain accessible to you, and this is just one more of my efforts to better connect with you and my constituents. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me using the contact tab on this page.

To contact me, please email, phone, or submit an online message. I welcome your comments and look forward to hearing from you.

Dr. Tyler King is originally from Memphis, TN and graduated with a Political Science degree with honors from the University of Tennessee. Upon college graduation, he was selected as a Teach For America Corps Member in the Rio Grande Valley where he taught high school history for four years in Donna, TX. During his time in the RGV, he met his wife Alejandra who is from Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico. They married and moved to Arkansas so Dr. King could pursue his lifelong dream of becoming a physician, following in his grandfather's footsteps.

After medical school, Dr. King and Alejandra were recruited to Laredo to join the Laredo Medical Center-Gateway Community Health Center Family Medicine Residency Program. He graduated from the residency program in June 2023 and is now practicing as a board certified Family Physician with Primary Care Associates of Laredo. He is a member of the medical staff at Laredo Medical Center.

Dr. King is also a Captain in the US Army Reserve. He and his wife Alejandra have two daughters, Sophia and Victoria.
