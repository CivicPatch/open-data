Biography
---------

![Uni-Trade Stadium](https://www.cityoflaredo.com/home/showpublishedimage/1432/638116260314400000)

Council Member Ruben Gutierrez Jr. was born and raised in Laredo, Texas. He is the product of local private and public school system, and is a proud graduate of the J. W. Nixon class of 1994.

Council Member Gutierrez is the proud father of four wonderful children; Alexis Nicole, Rebecca Ashton, Amber Michelle, Ruben III.

Being the grandson of former Precinct 1 Webb County Commissioner, the late, Jorge De La Garza was what sparked his interest in public service.

While serving at the Laredo Police Department for over 22 years, he obtained a Master Peace Officer License. Mr. Gutierrez also holds an Instructor’s License where he trained fellow police officers in crash investigation, advanced police motorcycle tactics and riding. He also served as a member, and advocate, of the Laredo Police Officers Association.

In 1998, he began his career as a Laredo Police Officer and opening several businesses along the way. In 2001, at the young age of 25, he opened his first business The Shield Escort Services Inc. A business that escorts local funeral processions, hazardous materials, and high value loads into Mexico. In 2008, he opened his second business, The Shield Freight Watch LLC. A business that secures high value loads leaving Laredo to different areas of the country.

In 2014, he sparked interest in commercial real estate and began investing in properties throughout the city. While acquiring knowledge, through his own experience, Mr. Gutierrez mentored fellow police officers to purchase their own home and become real estate investors as well. In 2016, he brought in Pumpd Nutrition to our city. A nutrition supplement retail shop, making this a third business under his belt.

 In 2020, being a commercial investor, Mr. Gutierrez saw the need and demand of general construction contractors in Laredo. This led to the opening of RGA Contractors, a company that assists homeowners with remodeling, renovations, and additions to their homes.

Knowing all too well the highs and lows of being a business owner, Mr. Gutierrez is very involved in the growth of local business and is an advocate for small businesses.

Being a long time public servant, in 2020 Mr. Gutierrez aspirations grew and he wanted to serve his community on a larger scale. Growing from his desire to help people on a one on one basis to wanting to serve the City as a whole, Mr. Gutierrez decided to run for District V City Council Member and was elected. He was then sworn in on December 22, 2020.

During his first term representing the constituents of District V, Mr. Gutierrez has emphasized on improving quality of life accomplishing the construction and revamping of local parks, street paving, bringing in new business, and adding much needed turning lanes throughout the District.

On November 2023, a unanimous vote by City of Laredo City Council, Mr. Gutierrez was named Mayor Pro Temp for the City.

A public servant for over 25 years and longtime entrepreneur, Council Member Gutiérrez believes with his leadership, and advocacy, he can increase the business industry in District V. He continues to take a one on one approach with the constituents he represents, making District V a more inviting, safer, and more entertaining place to live.
