Welcome to District VIII
------------------------

Welcome to District 8’s homepage. This district contains the heart of Laredo, as the majority of government offices are located in the Central Business District and is anchored also by the Laredo Community College.

Here you will find information on past and current projects that are geared towards revitalizing District 8 into a vibrant and livable area and restore it to its past glory. Projects like the Neighborhood Empowerment Zone, the Central Laredo Municipal Management District and the public/private partnership that will bring The Outlet Shoppes at Laredo to the site of the River Drive Mall are just a few of the many projects that I have worked so hard to improve your area.

To contact your Council Member, please email, phone, or submit an online message. I welcome your comments and look forward to hearing from you.

![District 8 bridge](https://www.cityoflaredo.com/home/showpublishedimage/1368/638114778072370000)
Alyssa Cigarroa is a fifth-generation Laredoan. After graduating from high school, she studied and worked in the arts for 10 years—including in Israel, Italy, France, New Mexico, and New York. Painting taught her the power of expression, communication, and the importance of careful examination and consideration of one's environment.

Alyssa re-established her home in Laredo several years ago with the intent of creating a vibrant arts community and improving educational opportunities for our artists.

![District 8 Mural](https://www.cityoflaredo.com/home/showpublishedimage/1372/638114778082370000)
Alyssa has been involved as a community leader in a number of ways. She is the co-founder and president of Cultivarte, a local non-profit, and she volunteers as a board member for several arts and cultural organizations. She also took on the management of her father's practice as the executive administrator of the Cigarroa Interventional Institute, where she is excited to facilitate the expansion of the clinic.

Alyssa ran for the City of Laredo District 8 council seat in 2020 and won as a write-in candidate.

She was recently honored as an Unmasked Hero by The Laredo Morning Times for her continued support in informing the community about the realities of Covid through the “Laredo Contra Covid” page as well as for assisting those impacted by the illness.

Additionally, she fund raised to help feed healthcare workers during the pandemic as well as to assist the residents of District 8 after the winter freeze.

Alyssa looks forward to carrying out her family legacy of commitment to service and helping the community.
