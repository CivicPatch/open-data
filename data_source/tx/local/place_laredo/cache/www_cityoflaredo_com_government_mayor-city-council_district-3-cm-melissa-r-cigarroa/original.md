Welcome to District III
-----------------------

Welcome to the homepage of District 3, composed of most of the south side west of U.S. 83 and south-central parts of town. Its unique natural elements make it a great place to live, work and play.

Those natural elements come in the form of the Chacon Creek Hike and Bike Trail, an ever growing network of trails with a Mexican free-tailed bat colony located in the creek under the Meadow Avenue overpass. The colony of bats presents an astounding spectacle every sunset for you to enjoy. Bird watching is also another activity that can be enjoyed within the creek area. If organized sports are your thing, my district has Slaughter Park, a major sports complex with soccer and baseball fields, basketball courts, outdoor exercise equipment and a future trail system where a novelty train will pass through, giving visitors an amazing experience.

We are working on many projects in District 3 as part of my desire to make our district a great place to live, work, play and raise your family.

To contact your Council Member, please email, phone, or submit an online message. I welcome your comments and look forward to hearing from you.
