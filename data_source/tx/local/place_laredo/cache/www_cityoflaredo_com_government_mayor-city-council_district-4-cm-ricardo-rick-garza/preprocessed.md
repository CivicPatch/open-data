Welcome to District IV
----------------------

Welcome to the homepage of District IV, the core of Laredo. The district is composed of most of Central Laredo and the near-east side. District IV isn’t limited to residential development, major medical centers are located in the district and the Saunders corridor is home to many businesses that serve the district and the entire city. As it is the center of the city, nearly everyone in this city spends a portion of their day in District IV.

The primary facility of the city that serves the public of District IV is the Inner City Complex. It is host to the Lamar Bruni Vergara Inner City Branch Library, Inner City Pool and Inner City Park. This center provides a myriad of public services and recreation opportunities for everyone in the family, especially our children and elderly.

I invite you to explore our page to acquire additional information regarding projects and events that I work to bring to you. My primary goal is to improve the quality of life and for the residents of District IV, while improving the relationship between the City of Laredo and its residents. My commitment is always provide an open government, available to you and, through this page, you have one more option to contact me with any concerns, issues, or ideas you may have

Feel free to contact me via email, phone, or by submitting an online message. I welcome your comments and look forward to hearing from you.
