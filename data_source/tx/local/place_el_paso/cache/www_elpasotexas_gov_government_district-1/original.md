Biography
---------

Alejandra Chávez is a proud El Paso native and graduate of the University of Texas at Austin, where she earned a Bachelor’s degree in Corporate Communications with a Minor in Business Administration. She began her career in Corporate America before pursuing her lifelong dream of studying culinary arts, earning a master’s degree at the prestigious Italian Culinary Institute for Foreigners (ICIF), where she was honored as “A Friend of Italian Cuisine.”

Returning to El Paso, Alejandra opened a small four-table restaurant that she grew into a highly successful white-tablecloth establishment, serving the community for 20 years. Throughout those two decades, Alejandra became deeply embedded in the fabric of El Paso, hiring hundreds of local residents and contributing to numerous charitable organizations and community initiatives. Her restaurant not only provided exceptional dining experiences but also became a cornerstone for community connection and support.

In 2022, Alejandra was honored as the SBA Women in Business Champion of the Year, recognizing her entrepreneurial achievements and her unwavering commitment to fostering economic growth and community development in El Paso.

Alejandra’s leadership extends beyond the restaurant industry. She was invited by the Mexican Consulate to represent El Paso at the World Trade Center in Mexico City, where she helped form a national restaurant association for Mexicans living in the United States. She also participated in the Paso del Norte Entrepreneurship Oral History Project and has been featured in local and national media for her culinary achievements and contributions to the community.

Committed to lifelong learning, Alejandra completed the Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative Education Program at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and the Blue Wave Supplier Diversity Program. She has shared her expertise on national platforms, including the USHCC Legislative Summit in Washington, D.C., where she was a distinguished speaker.

Raised in a loving home in District 1, Alejandra learned the values of integrity, humility, and service from her late mother and grandmother, lessons that continue to guide her approach to leadership. As a wife and mother of three, she understands the importance of building a city that supports families and provides opportunities for future generations.

Today, Alejandra brings her values of honesty, integrity, and accountability to City Hall. She is dedicated to addressing District 1’s critical infrastructure needs, promoting economic development, and enhancing public safety while ensuring that all residents feel heard and valued. Her vision is to create a more vibrant and united El Paso, one that reflects the pride of its residents and the strength of its community.

When not working, Alejandra enjoys cooking family recipes, volunteering, and spending time with her husband and children. She is deeply grateful for the opportunity to serve the residents of District 1 and is committed to working tirelessly to create meaningful change.
