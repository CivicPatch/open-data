Biography
---------

Deanna Maldonado-Rocha, a dedicated 51-year-old resident of El Paso, brings a wealth of experience from both local and corporate spheres. With nearly three decades at AT&T, Deanna has honed her skills in business, forecasting, and operations. Her professional journey continues at Accolade, Inc., where she remains committed to excellence.

Before her blissful marriage of over nine years, Deanna successfully navigated the challenges of single motherhood, balancing school, work, and parenting. Her determination led her to earn a bachelor's degree in business management from the University of Phoenix and a Master's in Global Management. During a brief period between her corporate roles, she became certified as a Life Coach and earned a LinkedIn certification in Full Stack Web Development through local community organizations.

Deanna's passion for community service is evident through her multiple Presidential Volunteer Awards. Her thirst for knowledge drives her forward, and she actively participates in the Education & Workforce Development Committee. Previously, she served as the president of AT&T's ERG HACEMOS local chapter, championing vital initiatives.

Deanna Maldonado-Rocha is a true advocate for her community, and her dedication to service and excellence makes her an invaluable asset to El Paso's District 3.
