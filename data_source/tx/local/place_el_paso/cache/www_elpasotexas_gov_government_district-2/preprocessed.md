Representative Josh Acevedo was born and raised in the Five Points neighborhood of Central El Paso. As a lifelong El Pasoan, he has dedicated his career to being a public servant.

Representative Acevedo is a proud product of the El Paso Independent School District, where he graduated from El Paso High School. He is a four-time graduate of The University of Texas at El Paso, where he has earned a Bachelor of Science in Microbiology, a Master of Arts in Political Science, a Master of Public Administration in Public Policy and Management, and a Doctor of Education in Educational Leadership and Administration. Dr. Acevedo’s dissertation was a case study of school closures that occurred at EPISD in 2019.

Before being elected to the El Paso City Council, Dr. Acevedo served on the El Paso Independent School District Board of Trustees from 2019 to 2024. While on the Board of Trustees, he hired the first female and Latina superintendent in the district’s 140-year history. He also helped champion an agenda of transparency and accountability, one of the highest teacher raises in El Paso’s history, passed an unprecedented parental leave policy, and maximized fiscal accountability throughout multiple budget cycles.

Prior to representing District 2, he worked for a national nonprofit where he helped school board members across the country with training and policy support. He has also managed two separate higher education programs – an internship program for university students and a backbone organization for mental health and emotional well-being in the Paso del Norte region.
Dr. Acevedo has been an adjunct professor at EPCC and UTEP, where he has taught policy and government classes for undergraduate and graduate students. He has also staffed a county official and interned on Capitol Hill.
Representative Acevedo looks forward to bringing community-oriented leadership to City Hall.
