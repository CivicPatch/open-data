The Keller City Council is composed of a mayor and six council members in places designated as 1 through 6, all elected at-large for three-year terms by a majority of the registered voters within the city limits of Keller.   
  
City Council Place 6 was added and terms extended to three years with citizen approval of amendments to the City Charter in November 2010.

Under the provisions of the City Charter, and subject only to the limitations imposed by the Texas Constitution, Texas law and the City Charter, the Keller City Council enacts local legislation, adopts the annual operating budget and sets policy.

Regular Keller City Council meetings are held on the first and third Tuesday of each month at Keller Town Hall, 1100 Bear Creek Parkway. Meetings generally start with a Pre-Council meeting at 5 p.m. followed by the Regular City Council meeting at 7 p.m. All Keller City Council meetings are open to the public.
