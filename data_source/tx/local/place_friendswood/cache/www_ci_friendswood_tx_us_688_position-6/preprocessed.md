==========

Councilmember Michael P. Ross
-----------------------------

Councilmember Michael P. Ross is a father, husband, and a developer. Friendswood has been his family’s home for the past 19 years, and is honored to have the opportunity to serve this incredible community. He has been married to
for 28 years, and are proud parents to three wonderful children—Trevor, Ashlyn, and Taylor—all graduates of Friendswood High School. They welcomed one of the newest residents of Friendswood with the addition of his first grandchild.

Growing up in the Sagemont area, he has always valued strong, resilient communities where neighbors support one another. Friendswood embodies those values, providing a safe and welcoming environment for families to thrive. His passion for this city comes from the deep appreciation he and his family have for the people who make it such a special place.

Professionally, he has built a career in both residential and commercial real estate, working closely with cities across Texas. This experience has given him firsthand knowledge of what makes local governments effective—and where they can fall short. He wants to bring that perspective to Friendswood City Council, ensuring we maintain a forward-thinking, transparent, and community-focused government.

He believes that strong governance starts with engaged citizens. By welcoming more residents into the decision-making process, we can strengthen our community and make Friendswood an even better place to live. He looks forward to the opportunity to serve, listen, and work alongside you to shape the future of our city.
