Position 4
==========

Councilmember Robert J. Griffon
-------------------------------

Councilmember Griffon is currently serving on the Friendswood City Council, Position 4, with liaison assignments to the Senior Activity Center, Galveston County Consolidated Drainage District, and the Chair of the Clear Creek Watershed Steering Committee and regularly meets with the Harris and Brazoria County Consolidated Drainage Districts.

Robert Griffon is a lifelong resident of Friendswood and was raised in the Friendswood Public Education System, having attended Westwood Elementary, Junior High and High School, graduating with the class of 1979.

Robert is an alum of Texas Tech University, having earned his BBA in Petroleum Land Management.  As a student advocate and along with twenty-three other students, Robert helped to bring the PLM curriculum to Texas Tech and was in the first graduating class with that degree.  The degree today is the much coveted and industry respected “Energy Commerce” program in the Rawls Business College.

Robert began his professional career as a petroleum Landman working in numerous county courthouses in Texas and some in Louisiana.  In 1992, Robert, with partners, purchased at auction, numerous oil and gas properties in North Dakota, and in 1996, as member/manager of Griffon & Associates, LLC, began producing/operating, drilling, and re-completing wells primarily focused in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and the Outlook Field in Montana with extensive exposure to the Bakken Shale.   Robert is deemed an expert witness and has testified on numerous occasions before the North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC) for pooling and all operating and land related matters.  In 2008, Robert packaged and sold all of G&A’s operated properties to XTO Energy and is currently the President of a family-owned sub-chapter s corporation managing investments in private and publicly traded companies and other assets in timber, minerals, royalty interest and non-operated working interests in Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas.

Robert is the President and Chairman of the Board of the J.P. Griffon Memorial Foundation, a 501(c)3 charitable organization which was establish after John Paul Griffon’s life was tragically cut short in an automobile accident on March 15, 1988.  The memory of J.P.’s life lives on through an annual fishing tournament held in Port Mansfield, Texas.  What was once a small get together has turned into one of the largest fishing tournaments on the Texas Gulf Coast held on the weekend after Mother’s Day.  This tournament is a fund-raiser whose sole purpose and goals are to promote higher education by advancing financial assistance in the form of scholarships.  To encourage and facilitate continuing educational opportunities for high school graduating seniors in Friendswood and surrounding communities.  To that end, the J.P. Griffon Memorial Foundation has provided over $425,000.00 in scholarships, educational opportunities and assistance that might not otherwise have been available for the students in our area.

Robert is a 32nd Degree Master Mason and Past Master of the Anson Jones Masonic Lodge #1416 in Friendswood. He is currently serving as its treasurer and is a voting member of The Grand Lodge of Texas in Waco.  Since its founding in Friendswood in 1966, the Anson Jones Lodge has brought together hundreds of like-minded men, bound by the moral principles of the fraternity who, with his brothers, have found many ways in which to serve his God, his family, his community, and his country. Anson Jones Masonic Lodge is a non-profit 501(c)10 fraternal organization which proudly provides scholarships to graduating seniors in our area. We have also reached out to our area public school administrators and have made available to financially struggling children our “Angel Fund.”  If there is a need in the school for a child to have a coat, shoes, eyeglasses, eye exams or anything out of the reach of their meager means, the angel fund is there for them. We also participate in the “Fantastic Teeth” program where we visit area elementary schools and provide toothbrushes, toothpaste, and other dental care products, and reading material about the necessity for good oral hygiene.
