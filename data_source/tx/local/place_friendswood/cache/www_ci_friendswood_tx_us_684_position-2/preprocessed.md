Councilmember Sally Branson
---------------------------

Sally is a lifelong Friendswoodian. After graduating from Friendswood High School in 1976 she briefly moved away to attend The University of Texas at Austin receiving her BBA. She returned to Friendswood where she met and married her husband of over 35 years, Jon. They raised 3 children, all of whom graduated from Friendswood High School. She is now the proud grandmother of 3 grandchildren currently making their way through the Friendswood school system as Sally and her children did.

She began her career at NASA Johnson Space Center in the Chief Financial Officers Directorate in 1989, prior to joining the Financial Services Industry in 2000. Unsurprisingly, Sally chose downtown Friendswood as the location for her business that she now owns and manages with her oldest son.
