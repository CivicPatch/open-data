Message from the Mayor
======================

I feel very fortunate that my wife and I found Friendswood when we moved our family to this area over 20 years ago. Like any city of its size, Friendswood has challenges. During the time span of one generation, the Bay Area has dramatically grown in population. Even with the growth surrounding Friendswood, the city has managed to retain the pillars upon which it was founded: faith, family, and education.
