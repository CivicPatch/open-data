Mona's journey began more than 28 years ago when she relocated from Houston to Pearland, marking the commencement of her active involvement in both the business and community expertise. Hailing from a family with humble origins, Mona's upbringing instilled in her a deep-rooted commitment to local community initiatives, driven by a passion for fostering positive impacts and contributing to the betterment of the community.

With a family history deeply rooted in military service, public safety roles, and federal agency involvement, Mona developed a genuine desire to be hands-on and engaged in various community endeavors. Her pride in being a Pearland resident is matched by her sense of accomplishment in owning a local business for over two decades. This business has played a pivotal role in generating economic activity, creating jobs, retaining local funds, fortifying the local economy, and actively supporting community charities and causes. Recognition, such as the Pearland Chamber of Commerce's "Business of the Year" and the US Chamber of Commerce Blue Ribbon "Business of the Year,", where her company also received House Bill recognition from The State of Texas Representative Glenda Dawson for economic and community impact.

Her dedication to community service extends beyond business achievements. Mona has been honored as the "Tom Reid Citizen of the Year" by the Pearland Chamber of Commerce, receiving accolades and proclamations from Representative Ed Thompson, and Senator Mayes Middleton, demonstrating a longstanding commitment to making Pearland an even better place to live and work.

In her commitment to community betterment, Mona has actively participated in local government and non-profit organizations. With a three-decade history in the non-profit sector, including service with the Houston Read Commission, which was a commission of the Mayor and City Council, Mona has leveraged her expertise in non-profit accounting and management to further her passion for community improvement.
