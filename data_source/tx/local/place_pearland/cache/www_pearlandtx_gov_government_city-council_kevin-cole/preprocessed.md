Kevin Cole was sworn in as Mayor for the City of Pearland on November 17, 2020.

Prior to becoming mayor, Cole has a combined nine years of prior City Council service, having served from 1995-1998 and from 2004-2010, helping secure the 2007 bond program election, the Cowart’s Creek diversion project, and strategic policy decisions that have spurred development of the Lower Kirby district. He also served as a commissioner on the city’s Planning and Zoning Commission in 1994.

In his professional career, Cole spent 24 years developing real estate, currently serving as the principal for Jack Enterprises, LLC. Over his career, Cole has assisted in developing and consulting on more than 6,500 residential lots resulting in $1.7B of capital investment.

Cole has been a Pearland resident since 1977 and is a graduate of Pearland High School and Texas Tech University, where he received a BA in Marketing and a minor in Public Relations. He and his wife Lisa have four children and 13 grandchildren.

Cole has spent his time as Mayor working with Council to implement his PEAR Plan (Protection, Economic Development, Accessibility [Transportation] and Resource Management)

Focus on improving transportation infrastructure, emphasizing efficient traffic flow and signal technology. I plan to enhance travel time reliability, leverage regional funding for local projects, and update the city's Major Thoroughfare Plan to support smart growth and prosperity.

As a mayor, I prioritize budgeting through a citizen based strategic planning approach with the City Council. This ensures an effective and efficient use of tax-payer funds.
