I am a lifelong resident of Pearland for over 51 years. As a graduate of Pearland High School in 1985, I was educated in Pearland ISD attending CJ Harris Elementary, Pearland Junior High, and Pearland High School. I went on to the University of Houston and graduated from the University of Houston Bauer School of Business with a Bachelor of Business Administration – Marketing in 1989. With my education behind me, I bought my first and only home in Pearland and got engaged to my High School sweetheart, Aida Koza, in 1990. Our son, Jonathon, came along in 1996 followed by our daughter, Maritza, in 1997. They both attended St. Helen’s Catholic School and transitioned into Pearland ISD where both graduated from Pearland High School. Following in the footsteps of their parents, they both went on to attend and graduate from the University of Houston as well. I have been blessed to work for a third-generation family-owned business that was established in Pearland on May 5, 1965.
