1. Mayor and City Council

Mayor and City Council
======================

The City Council serves as a link between the citizens of Southlake and their municipal government. The City of Southlake operates under a
council-manager form of government
as approved by voters in 1987 through the adoption of the Southlake City Charter.

The
Southlake Charter
provides that the Southlake City Council shall consist of the Mayor and six Council members elected by numbered places and are elected at-large by the registered voters of Southlake to serve three-year, staggered terms of office.

Councilors help constituents by connecting them to resources, services, and City departments. City Council also administers the City's goals, major projects, and infrastructure improvements ranging from community growth and land use to finances and strategic planning. In addition, they serve as advocates for all Southlake residents.

* First and third Tuesday each month
* While the Council consists of a Mayor and six (6) Council places, they are not divided into geographic districts. Each Council member is elected at large and represents the entire community.
