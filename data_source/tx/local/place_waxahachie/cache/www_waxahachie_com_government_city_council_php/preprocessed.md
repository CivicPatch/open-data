City Council

On April 6, 1971, Waxahachie became a home-rule city. In Texas, any city with a population of 5,000 or more may become a home-rule city by establishing its own charter and submitting it to voters for approval. There are over 300 home-rule cities in Texas. Although each has its own charter, home-rule cities are subject to certain state and federal laws.

The Waxahachie City Council is a five-member body that is elected at large by the citizens. The Council Members serve staggered two-year terms. Each May, the Council appoints the mayor and mayor pro tem.
Meetings occur bi-monthly on the first and third Mondays at 7:00 p.m. in the Council Chambers at 401 S. Rogers.
Mail for the Mayor and City Council can be addressed to P.O. Box 757, Waxahachie, TX 75168.
