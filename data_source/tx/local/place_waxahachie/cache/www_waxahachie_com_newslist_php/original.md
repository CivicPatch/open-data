**What This Means for Residents  
Clear Public Comment Process**

* Residents may speak during the Public Comments portion of City Council meetings about items not on the agenda.

* Speakers must sign up:

+ In person at least 10 minutes before the meeting, or

+ Online by 4:00 p.m. on the day of the meeting.

* Each speaker is allowed up to 3 minutes.

* Speakers may speak once per meeting, per item, and cannot give unused time to others.

**Written Comments Welcome**

* Residents who prefer not to speak may submit written comments.

* These comments may be read or summarized by the Mayor and included in the meeting record.

**Public Hearings Made More Consistent**

* Public hearings now follow a standard process so everyone has a fair opportunity to be heard.

* Applicants and appellants are given time to present, followed by public testimony.

* Public speakers are limited to 3 minutes each.

* The Mayor may adjust time limits when many people wish to speak or an item is complex.

**Orderly and Respectful Meetings**

* Everyone attending meetings is expected to be respectful.

* Disruptive behavior, personal attacks, or profanity may result in removal from the meeting.

**How Decisions Are Made**

* State law limits City Council from debating or voting on topics raised during Public Comments.

* Issues raised by residents may be placed on a future agenda for discussion.

**Why This Was Done**

These changes are intended to:

* Improve consistency and fairness.

* Ensure meetings run smoothly and efficiently.

**When It Takes Effect**

The new rules will take effect on February 2, 2026.

[### MESSAGE FROM THE MAYOR](https://www.waxahachie.com/news_detail_T6_R444.php)

> I am deeply saddened by the death of Charlie Kirk. My heart aches for his family and loved ones, who will never celebrate holidays with him again. I sincerely hope the person responsible is found and justice is served.
>
> Every murder, where an innocent life is taken, is difficult for us to understand. Every murder we hear and read about, where an innocent life is taken, shakes most of us to the core. There is just no reason for it, and it sends us all into a state of shock.  
>   
> The death of Charlie Kirk is heartbreaking, along with all the other senseless deaths that have occurred before him and, unfortunately, will happen again in the future. I pray that we all come together, look beyond our differences, and practice compassion for one another. We don't all have to agree, but we should strive to be decent and show love to others whenever we can.
>
> It doesn't matter which state these horrific crimes occur in; they still impact us the same. Can we all agree that we can do better? I commit to continuing to work on becoming a better version of myself, even if I disagree with someone else's views or ideas. It’s never too late to improve and choose a better path forward.

> Mayor Billie Wallace

The Waxahachie City Council decided on Monday, July 7, to separate the employment of City Manager Michael Scott, effective immediately. Mr. Scott began his career with the City in 2002. He served in numerous leadership roles, including Downtown Director, Director of Planning, Assistant City Manager, and, most recently, as City Manager since 2017. His commitment and contributions to our community over more than two decades have left a lasting impact, and we extend our sincere gratitude for his years of service.

As we move forward, on Friday, July 11, the City Council voted unanimously to appoint Fire Chief Ricky Boyd as interim city manager to ensure a seamless transition and continued excellence in city operations. Chief Boyd has been with the City of Waxahachie for 13 years and has served for over 40 years in the fire service.

We are confident in the abilities of our leadership team and staff to maintain the high standards our residents expect and deserve. The City of Waxahachie remains united and focused on our shared vision for the future. We are committed to transparency, stability, and progress as we continue to serve our citizens with integrity and dedication. Together, we look forward to building on our strong foundation and advancing the interests of our vibrant community.

[### ELITE RATING PLACES WAXAHACHIE AMONG TOP-TIER FIRE DEPARTMENTS NATIONWIDE](https://www.waxahachie.com/news_detail_T6_R433.php)

The City of Waxahachie is proud to announce that the Waxahachie Fire-Rescue Department has achieved an ISO Class 1 rating, the highest possible score awarded by the Insurance Services Office (ISO). This prestigious designation places Waxahachie Fire-Rescue in an elite category, as fewer than 1% of fire departments across the nation earn this distinction.  
  
The ISO rating is a comprehensive evaluation that assesses a fire department's ability to respond effectively to emergencies and protect life and property. The rating system, known as the Public Protection Classification (PPC), measures several critical elements, including a department's staffing, training, equipment, facilities, water supply systems, and emergency communication capabilities.  
  
"This is a citywide accomplishment," said Waxahachie Fire Chief Ricky Boyd. "It takes a collaborative effort between all city departments, and support from our City Council as well as the City Manager and the rest of the City’s Staff, to earn a perfect rating. I especially commend our staff for their dedication and commitment to providing the citizens of Waxahachie with superior fire protection. Waxahachie Fire-Rescue is committed to continuing its efforts to maintain the ISO 1 Classification for years to come.”

[### CITY OF WAXAHACHIE EARNS 2024 TREE CITY USA RECOGNITION](https://www.waxahachie.com/news_detail_T6_R432.php)

The Arbor Day Foundation named the City of Waxahachie a 2024 Tree City USA in honor of its commitment to plant, grow, and maintain trees to benefit its community.

The Arbor Day Foundation is a global nonprofit with a mission to inspire people to plant, nurture and celebrate trees. Its network of more than a million supporters and partners has helped the organization plant more than 500 million trees in forests and communities across more than 60 countries since 1972. The Tree City USA program has recognized cities and towns that leverage urban forestry to enhance the livability and sustainability of their local area for over 50 years.

“We all have a role to play in shaping our future and tree champions like Waxahachie are leading the way,” said Michelle Saulnier, Vice President of Programs at the Arbor Day Foundation. “Trees are critical infrastructure, building resiliency and fostering good health in our nation’s cities. We’re proud Waxahachie is among the Arbor Day Foundation’s growing network of communities dedicated to creating positive impact through trees.”

In cities and neighborhoods, trees are proven to help mitigate the urban heat island effect, reduce stormwater runoff, improve air quality, and boost mental and physical health. When the right trees are planted in the right places, they can also reduce traffic noise, increase property values, and lower energy costs for homeowners.

“Being part of Tree City USA is a testament to the City's commitment to creating a healthy environment for our residents.  I am proud to be part of an organization prioritizing nature and sustainability, said Chris Seale, City of Waxahachie Horticulturist.

To earn Tree City USA recognition, a city must uphold four core standards including maintaining a tree board or department, having a community tree ordinance, spending at least $2 per capita on urban forestry, and participating in an Arbor Day celebration.

The Arbor Day Foundation’s Tree City USA program is operated in partnership with the National Association of State Foresters and the USDA Forest Service.  To learn more about the program or how to apply, visit [arborday.org](https://www.arborday.org/).

[### MAYOR WALLACE RECOGNIZED AT CITY COUNCIL MEETING](https://www.waxahachie.com/news_detail_T6_R431.php)

Mayor Billie Wallace was recognized at the City Council meeting on Monday, April 7, for recertifying her Certified Municipal Official (CMO) designation. She was officially recognized on Thursday, March 20, at the Texas Municipal League (TML) Midyear Conference in Austin, Texas.

The CMO Program, offered by the Texas Municipal League (TML), recognizes elected city officials in Texas who commit to ongoing professional development. To earn the CMO designation, officials must complete 60 Continuing Education Units (CEUs) within two consecutive years, including at least 30 CEUs from in-person training and 1 CEU each in five core competency areas: Ethics, Finance, Governance, Open Meetings, and Public Information.

Training can be obtained through TML-sponsored events, such as conferences and workshops, and must be related to municipal leadership. The program requires regular CEU submissions and awards an official who meets the criteria a certificate, pin, and recognition at TML events. To maintain certification, officials must complete 15 CEUs annually, including in-person training and core areas.

The City of Waxahachie applauds Mayor Wallace's commitment to professional development and her continued success as a CMO. Her dedication to ongoing education sets an inspiring example for other council members to follow.

[### DRONE DELIVERIES TO BEGIN IN WAXAHACHIE SOON](https://www.waxahachie.com/news_detail_T6_R425.php)

**Zipline drone deliveries are expected to begin in Waxahachie in the coming weeks.**

According to Zipline, the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area is leading the country in quiet, fast, and convenient aerial delivery. Areas across the metroplex, like Garland, Frisco, and Denton, already offer similar services, and later this year, this innovative form of delivery will arrive in Waxahachie!

[Zipline](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flyzipline.com%2F&data=05%7C02%7CAlicia.Jauregui%40waxahachie.com%7C51637ce09fcc455963f308dd708b4078%7C7eb99bf776a14f939d39898a305b6a58%7C0%7C0%7C638790465578615975%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C4000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Rvn%2BJWaZU7OGLwweDeOQdPYl8TrK4PsXLakqUeUjfBk%3D&reserved=0), the world's largest autonomous delivery system, will bring its ultra-fast, quiet delivery service to the Waxahachie Walmart later this year.

When it starts operating, Zipline will deliver thousands of items from the Walmart on 1200 N Highway 77 to residents in the area. Zipline aircraft are quieter than passing cars and are designed for safety and privacy.

In preparation, Zipline will conduct a few calibration and validation flights with a small group of residents before officially launching. Over the coming weeks, residents in this area may occasionally notice flights by Zipline's aircraft. These operations will only occur during business hours and are part of Zipline's rigorous safety and operational protocols to ensure a great experience when they begin serving our community.

You should know that Zipline designs and manufactures its aircraft to optimize for safe, quiet, convenient deliveries. These aircraft are not like agricultural, videography, or consumer drones, and are instead equipped with many advanced safety features and privacy protections to ensure a reliable and community-friendly experience.

 The City has communicated with Zipline to ensure all activities comply with FAA regulations.

If you have questions about this exciting new service, please contact Zipline directly at [DFW@flyzipline.com](mailto:DFW@flyzipline.com) .

“It is gratifying to see our elected officials be recognized for their remarkable dedication and service to the Waxahachie community,” said City Manager Michael Scott. “The knowledge that this education provides is invaluable to our citizens.”

Councilmember Billie Wallace will also be recognized at the conference with a Certificate of Recognition for successful completion of 42 or more CEUs in a calendar year.

[### WATER CONSERVATION LOWERED TO STAGE 2](https://www.waxahachie.com/news_detail_T6_R384.php)

As of January 9, 2024, Waxahachie is now in Stage 2 of the City’s Water Conservation Plan. While at Stage 2 we are not yet under mandatory restrictions, Citizens are strongly encouraged to conserve water and reduce all non-essential water use. This plan, also referred to as the Drought Contingency Plan, was adopted in 2019 by City Council as a proactive measure to help conserve our community’s water supply, especially in the case of severe drought.

Each of the plan levels are listed below, along with what each level entails. We are currently at Stage 2.

Stage 1: No formal restrictions, however citizens are encouraged to refrain from outdoor watering between 10am to 6pm, the hottest hours of the day.

Stage 2: (WE ARE CURRENTLY HERE) Customers are encouraged to conserve water, and reduce all non-essential water use.

Stage 3: Mandatory limits on lawn and landscape watering will be enacted, and water use will be limited to certain defined days of the week.

Stage 4: Mandatory water restrictions will be strengthened to Saturday only from 4am to 10am.

Stage 5: Mandatory water restrictions will be strengthened to prohibit watering of commercial lawns and landscapes.

Please note that most of these stages are unlikely, however we do have a plan in place should extreme conditions ever arise. We hope this information helps clarify our Water Conservation Plan, and we thank each of our residents for helping do their part!
