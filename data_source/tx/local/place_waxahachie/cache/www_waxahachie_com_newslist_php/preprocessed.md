> I am deeply saddened by the death of Charlie Kirk. My heart aches for his family and loved ones, who will never celebrate holidays with him again. I sincerely hope the person responsible is found and justice is served.
>
> Every murder, where an innocent life is taken, is difficult for us to understand. Every murder we hear and read about, where an innocent life is taken, shakes most of us to the core. There is just no reason for it, and it sends us all into a state of shock.
> The death of Charlie Kirk is heartbreaking, along with all the other senseless deaths that have occurred before him and, unfortunately, will happen again in the future. I pray that we all come together, look beyond our differences, and practice compassion for one another. We don't all have to agree, but we should strive to be decent and show love to others whenever we can.

[### CITY OF WAXAHACHIE EARNS 2024 TREE CITY USA RECOGNITION](https://www.waxahachie.com/news_detail_T6_R432.php)

The Arbor Day Foundation named the City of Waxahachie a 2024 Tree City USA in honor of its commitment to plant, grow, and maintain trees to benefit its community.

The Arbor Day Foundation is a global nonprofit with a mission to inspire people to plant, nurture and celebrate trees. Its network of more than a million supporters and partners has helped the organization plant more than 500 million trees in forests and communities across more than 60 countries since 1972. The Tree City USA program has recognized cities and towns that leverage urban forestry to enhance the livability and sustainability of their local area for over 50 years.

“We all have a role to play in shaping our future and tree champions like Waxahachie are leading the way,” said Michelle Saulnier, Vice President of Programs at the Arbor Day Foundation. “Trees are critical infrastructure, building resiliency and fostering good health in our nation’s cities. We’re proud Waxahachie is among the Arbor Day Foundation’s growing network of communities dedicated to creating positive impact through trees.”

“Being part of Tree City USA is a testament to the City's commitment to creating a healthy environment for our residents.  I am proud to be part of an organization prioritizing nature and sustainability, said Chris Seale, City of Waxahachie Horticulturist.

To earn Tree City USA recognition, a city must uphold four core standards including maintaining a tree board or department, having a community tree ordinance, spending at least $2 per capita on urban forestry, and participating in an Arbor Day celebration.

The Arbor Day Foundation’s Tree City USA program is operated in partnership with the National Association of State Foresters and the USDA Forest Service.  To learn more about the program or how to apply, visit

[### MAYOR WALLACE RECOGNIZED AT CITY COUNCIL MEETING](https://www.waxahachie.com/news_detail_T6_R431.php)

Mayor Billie Wallace was recognized at the City Council meeting on Monday, April 7, for recertifying her Certified Municipal Official (CMO) designation. She was officially recognized on Thursday, March 20, at the Texas Municipal League (TML) Midyear Conference in Austin, Texas.

The CMO Program, offered by the Texas Municipal League (TML), recognizes elected city officials in Texas who commit to ongoing professional development. To earn the CMO designation, officials must complete 60 Continuing Education Units (CEUs) within two consecutive years, including at least 30 CEUs from in-person training and 1 CEU each in five core competency areas: Ethics, Finance, Governance, Open Meetings, and Public Information.

Training can be obtained through TML-sponsored events, such as conferences and workshops, and must be related to municipal leadership. The program requires regular CEU submissions and awards an official who meets the criteria a certificate, pin, and recognition at TML events. To maintain certification, officials must complete 15 CEUs annually, including in-person training and core areas.

The City of Waxahachie applauds Mayor Wallace's commitment to professional development and her continued success as a CMO. Her dedication to ongoing education sets an inspiring example for other council members to follow.

measure to help conserve our community’s water supply, especially in the case of severe drought.

Stage 3: Mandatory limits on lawn and landscape watering will be enacted, and water use will be limited to certain defined days of the week.

Stage 4: Mandatory water restrictions will be strengthened to Saturday only from 4am to 10am.
