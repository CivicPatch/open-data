Council Place 1
===============

Pat Shelbourne and his wife Ollie moved to Watauga in 2009. He graduated from the 2010 Watauga Citizens Police Academy. Pat ran for Place 6, Watauga City Council, and was elected in a special election on November 2, 2010. He served in that position until May 2018, when he ran for and was elected Mayor.  He resigned in November 2018, having had surgery following an auto accident, and dealing with other medical issues.  In May 2021, he was elected to Place 1, Watauga City Council.

Pat is a retired Certified Public Accountant, having served in public accounting, the banking industry and Texas public schools in various financial officer roles. His wife Ollie is a retired third-grade teacher, having taught in various school districts in Texas, and retiring from the Hurst-Euless-Bedford schools after teaching there for several years. 

“I hope to serve the City again by working with the Mayor and city council in helping to make sound, rational decisions on matters brought before the council, and to always keep the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens foremost in my actions. Thank you for the opportunity to serve Watauga.”
