Mayor
=====

Mayor Arthur L. Miner was elected to Council on May 4, 2019.

Art was born in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. As a member of a military family, he moved frequently, spending the majority of his formative years in Arizona and New Mexico. After high school, Art enlisted in the United States Navy, where he served for the next 24 years (1972–1996). He met Sharon, his wife of 45 years, while stationed at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi. Art and Sharon have two children, Jarrel and Amanda, both of whom attended Keller ISD schools. They are also the proud grandparents of grandson Braden and granddaughter Annabel.

During his military career, Art served aboard seven aircraft carriers, where he completed seven major deployments (seven months or longer), spanning from Vietnam to Operation Desert Storm. He returned home from one deployment to meet his five-month-old daughter, Amanda. Art culminated his naval career at the Naval Aviation Maintenance Office in Patuxent River, Maryland, where he served as the Program Manager for the Naval Air Systems Command Aircraft Battle Damage Repair Program.

After retiring from the Navy, Art held positions as Production Manager, Operations Manager, and Plant Manager for various companies in the Metroplex. On the home front, Art immediately immersed himself in the community, coaching baseball for four years with NAYA, girls' basketball with Upward, and girls' volleyball with the YMCA. Within a few years, Art began his venture into local city service. Mayor Hector Garcia appointed Art to his first city board, the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board, in 1998. Wanting to be more involved, Art was appointed to the Parks Development Corporation two years later, where he has served as President for 12 of those years. He also served on the Veterans Advisory Board. Capp Smith Park, the Hector F. Garcia Recreation Center, and the Veterans Memorial are among the major accomplishments during his tenure.

After many years of encouragement from friends and others, Art decided to enter the political arena and run for mayor. He was sworn in as mayor in May 2019. Mayor Miner said, "I have an excellent city council and an outstanding city manager, and I look forward to great things for the City of Watauga." Art also serves as president of the Economic Development Corporation.
