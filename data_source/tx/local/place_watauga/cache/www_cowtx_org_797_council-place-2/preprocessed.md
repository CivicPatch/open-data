Mayor Pro Tem, Place 2
======================

Councilmember Cris Blackburn was elected to Council, Place 2 on May 4, 2024.

Cris Blackburn is a native Texan who has lived in Watauga since 1998 after moving from Arlington. She is the mother of three Keller Central High School graduates, a spouse, a pet foster for several 501(c)(3) rescues, and a long-time community volunteer. Since 2009, she has served on the planning and zoning, charter review, and library boards. Additionally, she contributed to the development of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan, One Watauga, which envisions our city’s land use 50 to 100 years into the future.

Cris Blackburn has spent years serving on PTA boards, Band Booster boards, and Athletic Booster boards. For the past 15 years, she has been a Meals on Wheels volunteer in our city, delivering hot meals and smiles to Watauga citizens. She strongly believes in having a servant’s heart and practices this by leading through volunteerism.

Cris Blackburn believes we have the chance to build a strong community with committed volunteers in this city. In her free time, she loves to garden, spend time with her fosters, go antiquing, or actively participate in animal rescues. You can meet her at city meetings or see her volunteering at adoption events.

“I am excited to be part of the leadership of our small town, and I’m confident that I will help bring positive changes to our community.”
