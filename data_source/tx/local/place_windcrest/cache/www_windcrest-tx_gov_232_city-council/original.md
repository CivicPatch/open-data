The Windcrest City Council
==========================

Definition & Powers of the City Council
---------------------------------------

Article III of the Windcrest City Charter defines the City Council roles, responsibilities, and election cycle. Section 3.06 calls for an election of the Mayor and two Council Members one year, and three Council Members the next year; all five Council Members and the Mayor are elected to a two-year term with no term limits. Further Section 3.11 calls for the election of the Mayor Pro Tempore from the Council membership to perform the duties of the Mayor in the case of the absence or inability of the Mayor to perform the duties of the office.

Section 4.01 states that all Council Members and the Mayor are elected at large. Meaning that all Council Members are representatives of all residents and not a specific district of constituents. Read the [Windcrest City Charter (PDF)](https://www.windcrest-tx.gov/DocumentCenter/View/1039) in its entirety.

City Council Meetings
---------------------

City Council Meetings are held every first and third Monday of every month, except when the meeting would fall on a recognized holiday. In these instances, the meeting would be rescheduled for the following Monday. View the [holiday schedule](https://www.windcrest-tx.gov/395/hours-of-operation).

### About Susie Hamilton

Susie Hamilton is a passionate community organizer with a long history of creating opportunities to bring folks together. Elected to Windcrest City Council in November 2024, she is honored by the trust her neighbors have placed in her and is thrilled to serve the city she loves at a higher level. Her goals as a council member include strengthening community trust through public events and recreation, supporting long-term city planning, and energizing Windcrest’s future — all while honoring the values and traditions that make the city unique. She also plans to leverage her background in media and promotions to increase Windcrest’s visibility well beyond the region.

Susie met her husband, Marc, in 2000 while he was working at a Windcrest business. After many years enjoying the city’s famous lights and welcoming atmosphere, they became proud residents in 2018. Together, they raise four spunky children — along with a rescue dog and several beloved cats — and rank Candy Cane Lane as their favorite Light Up tradition. As a family, they enjoy car shows, live music, and travel. They also host their annual “Aspic Invitational,” Susie’s nationally recognized spin on the classic dinner party, which has been featured in Texas Monthly and on the Today Show blog.

Since moving to Windcrest, Susie has been deeply involved in civic life. She currently serves as Secretary of the Windcrest Women’s Club (since 2022), chairs the annual Light Up Judging event and Old Bag Luncheon (both since 2023), and conceived the successful 2019 ArtWalk, a free event celebrating local artists along the golf course path. Her past appointments include serving on the Windcrest Economic Development Corporation (2020–2022) and the Board of Adjustments (2023–2024).

Professionally, Susie owns Six Mod Seven, a creative production company supporting the film community as a producer and production designer. Her work spans commercials, feature films, and corporate design projects. You’ve likely seen her work in campaigns for Whataburger, University Health, VH1, The Spruce, VIA Transit, Church’s Texas Chicken, Acura, and more. She holds a BA in Theatre from the University of Texas at El Paso and is a proud former Judson Rocket — though she assures Roosevelt fans it’s nothing personal.
