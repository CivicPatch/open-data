#### Ward 2

![Councilmember Albert Wright](https://www.cityofbrenham.org/revize_photo_gallery/Administration/awright.jpg?t=202405131029020 "Councilmember Albert Wright")
I am a native Washington County Texan and have called Brenham home since marrying my wife Emma in 1970. Together, we have 3 sons Chad, Justin, and Landan and enjoy our 5 beautiful grandchildren.

John Maxwell once said that "A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way." Servant leadership is not a goal I seek, but rather a core value I attempt to exemplify daily.

I believe true and effective leadership does not come with titles, but from people who are dedicated to serving others. I am committed to the spiritual and social advancement of this community. Some of my faith-based work includes being a pastor of the New Life Church of God since 1981 and Southern Interstate Ministries Conference (SIMC) Vice-Chairman. I have worked and volunteered for many community organizations including PTO president, BISD Mentor Program, Brenham Crime Stoppers, Washington County Youth Soccer Committee, and the Optimist Club to name a few.

I want to see Brenham continue to grow and prosper but in a positive way.  Not losing the unique qualities of our small town, as so many other areas have.”

Seeing someone grow and evolve in an area of their life is very rewarding,” said Saunders. “I ran for Council because I was ready to get out into the community and start giving my time to the place my family has called home since 2003. Job creation and growth is important to me as well. I would like to see more of our residents be able to work locally and not have to commute for higher pay or job diversity.”

I was blessed to have an amazing experience growing up in Brenham; and I want to make sure the Brenham I love can offer the same loving sense of community for my child and all future generations. I want to assist in ensuring we have a prosperous future and making sure that the people of Brenham have their voices heard at City Hall."
