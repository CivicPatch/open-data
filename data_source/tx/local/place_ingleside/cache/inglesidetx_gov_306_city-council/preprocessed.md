City Councilors are elected and represent the city "at large." Council Members serve staggered two-year terms with three members up for reelection each year. The Mayor is also elected at large and serves a two-year term. No Mayor or Council Member may serve more than three consecutive terms, whether partial or complete terms, whether elected or appointed.

The City Council is the legislative and policy-making body of the City of Ingleside, a "home-rule" city, operating under the authority of the City Charter. The Council enacts legislation, adopts the budget, sets the tax rate, determines policies, approves the appointment of the City Manager, City Attorney, Municipal Court of Record Judge, Municipal Court of Record Clerk, and all Boards and Commission Members.

The City Council receives information from the following groups to decide issues and set policy:

* Recommendations from City Staff based upon study and analysis
* Decisions and advice from the City Boards and Commissions
