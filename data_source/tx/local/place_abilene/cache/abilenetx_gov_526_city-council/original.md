1. [About](https://abilenetx.gov/526/City-Council#tab0e9418b5-4237-48c6-b666-db28d718b3d3_0)

The City Council is the legislative and policy-making body of the City of Abilene, a "home-rule" city, operating under the authority of the city charter, adopted in 1962. The council enacts legislation, adopts the budget, sets the tax rate, determines policies, approves the Mayor’s appointment of the City Manager, City Secretary, City Attorney, Municipal Court Judge, and all Boards and Commissions members.

Six City Councilors represent each of six "places" in the city (three north of South 1st Street and three south of South 1st) but are elected and serve "at-large", representing all the citizens of Abilene. Councilors serve staggered three-year terms with two members up for reelection each year.

### Rules of Procedure

### Setting Policies
