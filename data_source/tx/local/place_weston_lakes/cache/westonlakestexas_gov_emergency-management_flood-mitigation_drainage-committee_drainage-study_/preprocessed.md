The Committee commissioned Jones & Carter (consulting engineers for the City of Weston Lakes, Fort Bend #81 and Surface Properties) to perform a comprehensive study of the Pecan Lake drainage patterns in both normal and extreme events to determine what improvements could be made to alleviate both home and street flooding related to future events.

Under normal rain events, Pecan Lakes drains to the north, through Weston Lakes across FM 1093 (near Fulbrook) into Bessie’s Creek, and ultimately discharges into the Brazos River.  Recently, during extreme rain events such as the Memorial Day Flood (2015), Tax Day Flood (2016) and Hurricane Harvey (2017), the water from Bessie’s Creek backed up into the outfall for Pecan Lake (FM 1093 near Fulbrook) and forced the water back toward the southwest, causing adjacent street and structural flooding in several sections of Weston Lakes.

Initial engineer investigations and modeling, as well as ground surveys at the site have revealed a restriction that is negatively impacting the secondary flow of flood water to the Brazos River during extreme events.  An earthen dam with inadequate sized culverts is affecting the natural flow of water to the Brazos during extreme events.  Recommended improvements that could assist in providing a secondary relief point to allow flood water to flow to the Brazos River would be to remove the existing 24” culvert and replace it with four 48-inch pipes.  The restriction to this secondary drainage channel is located outside the Weston Lakes subdivision and also outside the City of Weston Lakes.  Implementation of this recommendation will require the approval of the property owner.

The Committee has adopted the drainage study and resulting recommendations for drainage improvements presented by Jones & Carter as part of their report issued April 24, 2018.
