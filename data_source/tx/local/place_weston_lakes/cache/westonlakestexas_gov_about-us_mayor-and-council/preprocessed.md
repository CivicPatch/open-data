Linda Harnist chose to move to Weston Lakes in 1999 because of its serenity, quality of life and the gates. She was working for a major national builder. During her sales career, she received National, Regional, and Local “Sales-Person of the Year” awards.  From 2004 to 2006, she was a sales professional for a smaller semi-custom builder selling in communities from the Woodlands to inside the loop, before retiring in 2006 to travel.  After living abroad in Australia and France, Linda returned home to life in Weston Lakes and to being active in the community.

Her community involvement includes Weston Lakes POA, Board of Director for the Katy Christian Women’s Connection, and a Board member for the Spirit of Freedom Women. Linda was a Fort Bend County Precinct Chair and Election Judge. She has participated in the planning of the Texana Center’s Tee Off Golf tournament held at the Weston Lakes Country Club and the Weston Lakes Veterans’ Day Dinners. Currently Linda also serves on the Board of Directors of the Texana Center, Fort Bend Subsidence District, and the Rails to Trails Initiative, a multi-county initiative.

Family comes first, and her daughter-Debbie, son-Scott and grandson-Jonah all live within 40 miles of Weston Lakes! Linda and her son Scott share a love of “classic automobiles”.

Since becoming a Council Member in 2016 and assuming the responsibility of the City’s Finance Officer, Linda has completed numerous hours of mandated State Coursework on Finance. In 2018 she was nominated by city council as the Mayor Pro Tem (assumes mayor’s responsibilities when the mayor is not available).

She has served on the Weston Lakes Emergency Management Committee as both Committee Secretary and Chief of Administration and Finance. As part of Emergency Management, she has completed the required training and participated in numerous emergency drills which were a collaboration between the city and Fort Bend County Emergency Management.

During and after Hurricane Harvey, Linda worked with the POA, County, State (Rebuild Texas), and the Federal Emergency Management Administration as Weston Lakes recovered from Hurricane Harvey. Her hours working for this event alone number in the 100s. One of her many roles during Harvey, was to document the incident, process Development Permits, and helped coordinate debris pick up both with Fort Bend County and private contractors.  Efforts during this time resulted in the City recuperating funds for Harvey related expenses from FEMA.  She is ready to continue her contribution to Emergency Management now and in the future.
