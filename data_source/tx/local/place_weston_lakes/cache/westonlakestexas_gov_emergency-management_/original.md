### **The City of Weston Lakes is in the process of rebuilding our Emergency Management team.**

We are looking for community volunteers to fill many positions. We also need volunteers to fill numerous spots in areas including command, logistics, finance and communications. We will also be rebuilding our CERT teams. Many Weston Lakes residents were part of our organization in the past and we invite you to use your experience to help out again. We also have many new residents who we would like to welcome to the team so that the community can benefit from the experience you bring with you. If you would like to be part of the emergency management team, know any Weston Lakes residents who might be interested, or would like more information about it please contact Bob Wall at mayor@westonlakestexas.gov, or Jeremy at citysec@westonlakestexas.gov or call 281-533-0907.
