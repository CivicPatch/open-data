The City of Weston Lakes is located West of Fulshear, and East of Simonton, Texas in Fort Bend County. The City was incorporated as a Type B City by order of the Fort Bend County Judge, Robert Hebert after the majority of the registered voters in the City voted to incorporate on May 10, 2008. The initial election for municipal officers was held on November 4th, 2008. Elected municipal officers include a mayor and five aldermen, who serve alternating two-year terms.

Within the gated section of the City are approximately 1500 home sites, 120 lots under builder development, a golf course, country club, private roads, golf course ponds, and two waterways, Pecan Lake and Oxbow Lake.  The country club is a privately owned and operated business within the City.  The City is adjacent to the Brazos River in a picturesque, mostly rural area.  Most of the remaining home sites in Weston Lakes proper are individually owned and only a small number are under development by corporate interests. New sections have recently been platted and accepted by the City to become part of Weston Lakes.

Schools are provided by Lamar Independent School District with Fletcher Morgan Elementary School, Roberts Middle School, Leaman Junior High School, and Fulshear Senior High School serving students in the City. It has one Municipal Utility District (Fort Bend MUD 81) servicing about three quarters of the community with water and sewer with the other quarter using a private water and sanitary system provided by a private company, Aqua Texas. The gated portion of the city is supervised by an elected Property Owners Association and rules are driven by the original developer’s deed restrictions and covenants. As part of those deed restrictions, a mandatory membership in the Weston Lakes Country Club is also required. The population of Weston Lakes as of the 2020 census was estimated to be around 3,853, with the agricultural portion of the City population estimated to be about 45.  The City is proud to be home to a very diverse mix in its demographics.  Properties vary from zero lot line patio homes to lots with several acres. The area of Weston Lakes is 2.5 square miles with about 35 miles of privately maintained roads.

The primary provider of law enforcement in is City is the Fort Bend County Sheriff, backed up by the Precinct #1 Constable.  The POA contracts with the Constables office to have an on duty officer present 40 hours per week.  Fire services are provided by the State established Emergency Service District #4 with the Fulshear-Simonton Volunteer Fire Department as their operating arm. EMS services are provided by the Fort Bend County Emergency Medical Services Offices.

The City of Weston Lakes is a small city and was established on the premise of small government providing minimal services as most of the standard municipal services are already provided. Future growth is limited by the boundaries and the fact that the population of Weston Lakes is not expected to grow beyond 4,000 – 5,000 people. There is no ad velorum tax as City expenses are covered by the receipt of utility franchise fees and mixed beverage tax received from the State Comptroller.
