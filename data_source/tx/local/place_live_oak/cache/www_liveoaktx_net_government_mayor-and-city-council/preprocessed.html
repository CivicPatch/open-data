The City of Live Oak is a home-rule municipality, meaning that it operates under a municipal charter that has been adopted or amended as authorized by Article XI, Section 5 of the Texas Constitution. The City of Live Oak was incorporated in 1960. Pursuant to its provisions and subject only to the limitations imposed by the state constitution and by state law, all powers of the City are vested in the elected City Council, which enacts local legislation, adopts budgets, and determines policies. The City Council executes the laws and oversees the government of the city.

Terms are for a period of two years with the Mayor and Council Places Two and Four being elected in even years.  Places One, Three and Five are elected in odd years.

           <p>
            Mayor Mary M. Dennis was born in Newton, Mississippi, into a military family that instilled in her the values of service, dedication, and perseverance. Her father’s career in the United States Army took the family across Europe and the United States before they eventually settled in San Antonio, Texas, when Mary was fifteen years old. These experiences exposed her to diverse communities and taught her the importance of public service, integrity, and compassion, principles that have guided her throughout her life and career.
           </p>
           <p class="mb-0">
            Before becoming Mayor, Mary served for several years on the Planning and Zoning Commission for the City of Live Oak, where she helped shape the city’s growth and infrastructure. Twice she ran for a council seat, demonstrating her determination and commitment to civic engagement and local governance. In 2010, she made history as the first African American Mayor of Live Oak, a position she has held with distinction since then, earning re-election in 2022. As Mayor, she has consistently focused on building stronger connections across the city’s diverse neighborhoods, increasing the efficiency and accessibility of city government, and ensuring that residents have a voice in shaping the future of their community.
           </p>
           <div class="displayBio">
            <p>
             Beyond her role as Mayor, Mary M. Dennis has established an exceptional record of leadership at the local, regional, state, and national levels.

At the national level, she serves as Vice Chair of the National League of Cities’ FAIR Committee (Finance, Administration &amp; Intergovernmental Relations) and is a member of both the Advisory Committee and the Small Cities Council. Her former NLC involvement includes service on the Audit Committee, Legislative Action Committee, Finance Committee, Nominating Committee, Transportation and Infrastructure Services Committee, and the National League of Cities’ Board of Directors (2019–2023). She is also a Board Member of the National Association of Regional Councils (NARC) and Co-Chair of its Economic and Community Development Committee, shaping policies and federal advocacy efforts to strengthen communities across the nation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Within the Texas Municipal League (TML), Mayor Dennis has held multiple leadership positions, including serving on the Executive Committee, the Nominating Committee, and as Chair of the Texas Municipal Center Visioning Committee. She has also served as President of TML for the 2016–2017 term and continues to provide guidance to municipalities across Texas on risk management, governance, and legislative priorities as a Board Member of the TML Intergovernmental Risk Pool. Regionally, she represents Live Oak with the Northeast Partnership, serves as an Alternate Member of the Alamo Area Metropolitan Planning Organization Transportation Policy Board, is the Regional Director for the Texas Association of Black City Council Members, and also participates in the Bexar County Suburban Cities and the San Antonio Mobility Coalition, Inc.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mayor Dennis’ civic engagement further extends through her involvement with the San Antonio Women’s Hall of Fame, the Judson ISD Bond Oversight Committee, the San Antonio Women’s Chamber of Commerce, and her role as Honorary Commander, Joint Base San Antonio. She has served as a keynote and featured guest speaker for institutions such as Wayland Baptist University, Texas Tribune Festival, the Young Women’s Leadership Academy, and Northeast Lakeview College, inspiring audiences with her message of leadership, service, and faith.
            </p>
            <p>
             Through all these roles, Mayor Mary M. Dennis has built an extraordinary legacy of public service marked by collaboration, advocacy, and tireless dedication to the residents of Live Oak and the broader region. A graduate of Sam Houston High School, she attended Our Lady of the Lake University and is a licensed mortician. She is also the proud mother of one daughter, Christina Dennis, and grandmother to Cierra, Chase, and Christine. Mayor Dennis epitomizes the power of persistence as well as the incomparable power of an abiding faith in God.

            Aaron Dahl is originally from Stamford, Connecticut. After spending some time in Washington, DC for his undergraduate degree, he eventually came to Texas A&amp;M to complete his masters degree. Dahl moved to San Antonio for work in 2003 and within a year decided to make the move permanent. The geographic location, access to major highways and abundance of stores and restaurants made Live Oak an attractive location to buy a home and in 2005, Dahl was among the first buyers in Bridlewood Park. In 2007, Dahl founded his own architecture firm where he remains owner and operator today.
           </p>
           <div class="displayBio">
            <p>
             In 2010, upon realizing stability in his professional endeavors, Dahl sought to contribute more to his local community. With his experience and background in development and construction, the logical first step was planning &amp; zoning. Once a vacancy became available, Dahl applied for, and was unanimously appointed as an alternate member of the Live Oak Planning &amp; Zoning board in 2010. During his short time on Planning &amp; Zoning, Dahl offered unique insight and critical risk reward perspectives from the vantage point of a city regarding future development and implications of the board’s decisions. Dahl religiously attended Planning &amp; Zoning meetings and also began routinely attending City Council meetings as well where he grew frustrated with one council member’s apparent focus on special interests and lack of commitment. Dahl knew this was not good for the future of Live Oak and he could do better. Dahl ran for City Council place 5 on a platform of common sense solutions for the greater good of the city. He was elected to City Council in May, 2011.

            <p>
             During his tenure on the City Council, Dahl has remained true to his initial values of financial security, support for police and fire and maintenance and improvements to the City. Dahl was the leading voice in the move to demolish and sell off the former Live Oak Civic Center and support a market study for a new hotel and conference center, paving the way for the development of the Hilton Garden Inn and Live Oak Conference Center in February, 2016. Dahl was a strong advocate of economic incentives to secure the development of IKEA and The Live Oak Town Center. Recently, he has been a strong supporter of the City of Live Oak Parks Master Plan and required improvements. Dahl continues to evaluate and support positive development opportunities within the limits of our city.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dahl has seen four city managers and has run for reelection six times, unopposed. Dahl holds true to his core beliefs of rendering common sense decisions that are right for the community as a whole.
