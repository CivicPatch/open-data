Mayor Mary M. Dennis was born in Newton, Mississippi, into a military family that instilled in her the values of service, dedication, and perseverance. Her father’s career in the United States Army took the family across Europe and the United States before they eventually settled in San Antonio, Texas, when Mary was fifteen years old. These experiences exposed her to diverse communities and taught her the importance of public service, integrity, and compassion, principles that have guided her throughout her life and career.

Before becoming Mayor, Mary served for several years on the Planning and Zoning Commission for the City of Live Oak, where she helped shape the city’s growth and infrastructure. Twice she ran for a council seat, demonstrating her determination and commitment to civic engagement and local governance. In 2010, she made history as the first African American Mayor of Live Oak, a position she has held with distinction since then, earning re-election in 2022.

She is also a Board Member of the National Association of Regional Councils (NARC) and Co-Chair of its Economic and Community Development Committee, shaping policies and federal advocacy efforts to strengthen communities across the nation.

Within the Texas Municipal League (TML), Mayor Dennis has held multiple leadership positions, including serving on the Executive Committee, the Nominating Committee, and as Chair of the Texas Municipal Center Visioning Committee.

#### Aaron Dahl, Council Member, Place 5

[Email Council Member Dahl](mailto:adahl@liveoaktx.net "Email Council Member Dahl")

Aaron Dahl is originally from Stamford, Connecticut. After spending some time in Washington, DC for his undergraduate degree, he eventually came to Texas A&M to complete his masters degree. Dahl moved to San Antonio for work in 2003 and within a year decided to make the move permanent. The geographic location, access to major highways and abundance of stores and restaurants made Live Oak an attractive location to buy a home and in 2005, Dahl was among the first buyers in Bridlewood Park. In 2007, Dahl founded his own architecture firm where he remains owner and operator today.

In 2010, upon realizing stability in his professional endeavors, Dahl sought to contribute more to his local community. With his experience and background in development and construction, the logical first step was planning & zoning. Once a vacancy became available, Dahl applied for, and was unanimously appointed as an alternate member of the Live Oak Planning & Zoning board in 2010. During his short time on Planning & Zoning, Dahl offered unique insight and critical risk reward perspectives from the vantage point of a city regarding future development and implications of the board’s decisions. Dahl religiously attended Planning & Zoning meetings and also began routinely attending City Council meetings as well where he grew frustrated with one council member’s apparent focus on special interests and lack of commitment. Dahl knew this was not good for the future of Live Oak and he could do better. Dahl ran for City Council place 5 on a platform of common sense solutions for the greater good of the city. He was elected to City Council in May, 2011.

During his tenure on the City Council, Dahl has remained true to his initial values of financial security, support for police and fire and maintenance and improvements to the City. Dahl was the leading voice in the move to demolish and sell off the former Live Oak Civic Center and support a market study for a new hotel and conference center, paving the way for the development of the Hilton Garden Inn and Live Oak Conference Center in February, 2016. Dahl was a strong advocate of economic incentives to secure the development of IKEA and The Live Oak Town Center. Recently, he has been a strong supporter of the City of Live Oak Parks Master Plan and required improvements. Dahl continues to evaluate and support positive development opportunities within the limits of our city.

Dahl has seen four city managers and has run for reelection six times, unopposed. Dahl holds true to his core beliefs of rendering common sense decisions that are right for the community as a whole.
