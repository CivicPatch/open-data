The Mayor and City Council are proud to recognize special people, events, and programs that make Sanger a great place to live. Proclamations are formal declarations issued by the Mayor to honor a specific day, week, or month. We take great pride in our community and value the opportunity to honor the groups, organizations, and institutions that make Sanger a place we are proud to call home.

Requests should be submitted to the City Secretary’s Office at
[citysecretary@sangertexas.org](mailto:citysecretary@sangertexas.org)
with clear details, sample wording, and contact information.

You can review the policy as adopted by
Resolution 2025-15
