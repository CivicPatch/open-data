MICHAEL WEBBER

**2024 - 2026**  
  
I am Michael Webber and I am your representative on City Council, Place 2.  I grew up in the Rio Grande Valley, in a small town named Mission Texas.  When I graduated high school, I moved to Longview to attend LeTourneau University.  I graduated from LeTourneau with Bachelor’s Degree in Management with an Industrial Management Concentration.  School was so much fun; I went back to LeTourneau and earned my MBA in Business Administration.  I work as a Business Process Manage for a natural gas compression company where I specialize in cost control, efficiency gains, and system wide improvements.  I am a highly active member in the community, especially for those activities that involve kids.  I serve on the Dixie Baseball Board, the Gladewater Youth Basketball Board, and the Gusher Days board.  I believe we are all called to serve, and we should do our part to help out our community where we can.
