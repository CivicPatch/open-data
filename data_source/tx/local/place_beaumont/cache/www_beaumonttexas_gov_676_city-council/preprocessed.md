The Who, What, Where, When, and Why of Beaumont City Council
============================================================

City Council Meetings are a chance for you to see your local government in action and make your voice heard. There are often public workshops to discuss important topics, and it’s the chance for you to see exactly where your tax dollars are going and get a fascinating, first-hand look into the municipal decision-making process.

City Council is made up of a Mayor and six Councilmembers. Four of those Councilmembers are designated as “ward Councilmembers,” and two other Councilmembers are elected as “at-large” Councilmembers, representing the city as a whole. The ward councilmembers are elected by citizens who live in that area and are required to live in the ward they represent. The meeting is run by the City Manager, who executes or directs staff to execute any decisions they approve.
