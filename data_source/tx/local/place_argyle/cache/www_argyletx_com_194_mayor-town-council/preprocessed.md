The Town Council is comprised of the Mayor and five Council Members elected at-large by Argyle residents. Council places are numbered 1 through 5 and are filled by general election for two year terms. Places 1, 3 and 5 have terms that expire in odd-numbered years and the Office of Mayor and Places 2 and 4 have terms that expire in even-numbered years. In order to be elected to one of the offices of the municipality, a person must receive more votes than any other person running for the office (Plurality Vote Required).

The Argyle Town Council holds regular meetings on the third Monday of the month. When a holiday is observed on Monday, then the regular meeting will take place the following Tuesday. Meetings typically begin at 5:00 p.m. at Argyle Town Hall, 308 Denton St., E., Argyle, TX 76226.  Special meetings are called as needed.

The Mayor serves as the presiding officer at all meetings of the governing body and may vote only if there is a tie. In the Mayor's absence, the Mayor Pro Tem shall perform the Mayor's duties. A quorum of the Town Council is three members and does not include the Mayor.

The Town Council appoints the other officers of the municipality by ordinance including the Town Administrator, Town Secretary, Town Treasurer, Town Attorney, Municipal Court Judge, and any other officers or agents authorized by the governing body. The Town Council also appoints members to Argyle's advisory Boards and Commissions in accordance with the Board and Commission Appointing Policy and Procedure.
