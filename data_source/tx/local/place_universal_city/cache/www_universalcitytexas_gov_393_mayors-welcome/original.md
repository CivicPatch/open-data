Mayor's Welcome
===============

Welcome to Universal City, Texas!
---------------------------------

We are truly proud to be known as the Gateway to Joint Base San Antonio Randolph Air Force Base. Our City has come a long way since it was initially named Randolph Field back in 1930.

As a veteran myself, I understand why so many retired veterans who served at Randolph decided to remain here and call the community home. We even have a park meticulously planned by our Public Works Department named Veterans Park. And we're proud to be designated as a Purple Heart City. We also have veterans serving in our exceptional police and fire departments and among our administrative staff. Some of the volunteers in our amazing volunteer groups have served as well.

The list of other reasons why this city is so special is long. We have a beautiful master-planned golf course at our Olympia Hills Golf and Event Center where our food and beverage team stages fantastic weddings. The facility is open to the public. We hold second to none community events all year long.

Our citizens are served by two recognized school districts - [Schertz-Cibolo-Universal City ISD](http://www.scuc.txed.net/ "SCUC ISD") and [Judson ISD](http://www.judsonisd.org/). We've just recently held a ribbon cutting for a new, upscale mega commercial development as part of our Northlake Business Park expansion. Having this turnkey property here is a coup for Universal City.

Yes, Universal City is a great place for business and family. I hope to have the opportunity to meet some of you in the months ahead at our public gatherings for Vision 35, a ten-year blueprint for our City's future.

We're glad you're here!

Mayor Tom Maxwell
