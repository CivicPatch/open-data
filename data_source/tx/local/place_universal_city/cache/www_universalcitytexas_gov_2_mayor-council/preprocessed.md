1. Mayor & Council

Mayor & Council
===============

The City of Universal City, Texas, was incorporated in 1960 and adopted its home rule charter in 1972, becoming a council-manager form of government. The city council includes the mayor and six councilmembers.

The mayor is elected for a two-year term by majority vote in even-numbered years. Council members are elected at-large, for two-year staggered terms, with three council members elected in even numbered years and the remaining three elected in odd years. A general election is conducted each May for these city officials.

Council members do not receive a salary. Rather, the mayor receives $40 per month for expense reimbursement, while council members receive $30 per month. No council member can hold any other city office or be eligible for city employment during the term for which he/she was elected.

All powers of the city are exercised in the manner prescribed by the
[city charter](http://www.municode.com/Resources/gateway.asp?pid=10332&sid=43 "Universal City city charter")
, as amended, and city council has the authority to enact local legislation, adopt a city budget, determine policies and appoint a city manager. Council meetings are held on the first and third Tuesday of each month at 6:30 pm and are open to the public.

Mayoral & Mayor Pro Tem Duties
------------------------------

The mayor is the presiding officer of council and is recognized as head of the city government for all legislative and ceremonial purposes, and by the governor for purposes of military or martial law. During council meetings, the mayor shall vote only when necessary to break a tied vote.

The council elects a mayor pro tem who serves for a year. The mayor pro tem acts as mayor during the absence or disability of the mayor.
