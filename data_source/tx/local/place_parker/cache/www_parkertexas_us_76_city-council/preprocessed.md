The City of Parker is a Type-A General Law form of government in which the council establishes city policy through ordinances and resolutions.  The mayor ensures that city policy is carried out and is responsible for city operations.

The City Council consists of the mayor and five councilmembers. The mayor and council are elected at large, which means they represent the entire city and that all registered voters may vote for all six places. Following each election, the council selects a fellow councilmember to serve as mayor pro tem.
