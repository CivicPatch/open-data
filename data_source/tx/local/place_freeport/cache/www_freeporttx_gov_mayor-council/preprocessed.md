April 4, 2023

I graduated from Brazosport High School in 1971 and was drafted into the Army, later serving three years in the Marine Corps. I worked for Dow Chemical for seven years and then spent 21 years with the Brazoria County Road and Bridge Department.

My love for Freeport led me to run for City Council, where it’s an honor to serve our citizens.

This year marks 23 years as Pastor of the Miracle House of Prayer. My wife, Debra, and I have been married for 42 years. We serve Freeport with honesty and integrity.
