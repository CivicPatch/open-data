Addison, Texas is located in an area once called Peters Colony. It was settled as early as 1846 when Preston Witt built a house on White Rock Creek. Addison was incorporated on June 15, 1953, and became the Town of Addison with the adoption of a new charter on April 3, 1982.

The charter established the Council-Manager form of government for the Town. The Council is comprised of a Mayor and six members who are elected in at-large elections. Members are elected for two-year terms in alternating years. In Addison, the Mayor and City Council are elected to two-year terms and may serve up to three successive terms.

The Council's responsibility is to enact local legislation, adopt budgets, determine policies and appoint the City Manager. The City Manager serves as the chief administrator, ensuring the Council's policies are carried out. The Council meets in regular sessions on the second and fourth Tuesdays of each month at 7pm, but work sessions are frequently held prior to the meeting. The agenda is posted at Town Hall and on the
Meetings and Agendas
page on the Friday before each session. The public is welcome to attend all Council meetings.
