Born in New Jersey and raised in Southern California, Dan Liscio's journey from the coastlines of the West to the heart of Texas is as intriguing as it is diverse. His early career in footwear sales, starting at Nordstrom in women's shoes at the age of 17, eventually led him to a pivotal role as a marketing liaison and sales agent for K-Swiss tennis shoes. This position became the catalyst for his relocation to Texas approximately 25 years ago. He settled in Addison in 2019, and quickly became involved in the community by serving on the Board of Zoning Adjustment.

Having learned the importance of customer service early in his career, Dan has consistently applied a client-first approach throughout his professional journey. This dedication to service has been evident in his sales roles for such well-known brands like Adidas, Straight Down Clothing, and Maui Jim Sunglasses. Recently, Dan founded DPL Consulting, which represents national brands to the golf and resort industry. The firm, which also provides visual merchandising and staffing support for retail stores, collaborates with brands such as Cole Haan, Hugo Boss, Corkcicle, and Tory Burch. His dedication to service extends beyond business, as he actively bridges the gap between non-profits and the golf industry, reflecting his commitment to community engagement.

Dan graduated from California Polytechnic State University with a degree in business. A lifelong sports enthusiast, he is not only a triathlete but also has a passion for water sports and golf. Dan is the proud father to Ellie and Colby who live in a nearby town. He and his wife Katharine have recently adopted a rescue tabby cat named Buddy.
