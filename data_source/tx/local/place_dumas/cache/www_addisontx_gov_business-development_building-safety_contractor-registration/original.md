Contractor Registration
=======================

![](https://developmentservices.addisontx.gov/files/sharedassets/devservices/v/2/images/architecture.jpg)Contractor Registration with the Town of Addison has a new look!

The Town of Addison requires all contractors that wish to perform work within town limits to be registered with the Town prior to the start of any project.

The license holder remains responsible for all work performed within town limits.

The [registration application(PDF, 170KB)](https://developmentservices.addisontx.gov/files/sharedassets/devservices/v/1/documents/contractor_registration_application_fillablev1.pdf) includes an area where the license holder may designate individuals within their organization to obtain permits on their behalf for work within Addison.

Contractor registration is valid for one year from the date of issuance and requires annual renewal.

**REQUIRED DOCUMENTS**

In addition to the application, contractors are also required to provide;

* a valid form of state identification
* applicable professional licenses
* and proof of insurance

                                        Questions regarding registration may be submitted to [registrations@addisontx.gov](mailto:registrations@addisontx.gov).

**FEES**

Registration fees are based on the license type and are subject to change.

**VALIDATION INFORMATION**

Once a Contractor is registered with the town of Addison via the [CSS portal](https://egov.addisontx.gov/energov_prod/selfservice#/home), the **tradesmen** are required to submit a **separate** [validation form(PDF, 76KB)](https://developmentservices.addisontx.gov/files/sharedassets/devservices/v/1/documents/forms-and-applications/trade-validation-application-final-2025.pdf "Trade Validation Application Final 2025.pdf") attesting that they are the responsible party for their specific scope of work on a specific job site.

A new validation form is required for each scope of work, on each job site.

***No single validation form may be used for multiple job sites***.

The General Contractor is responsible for submitting a validation form when the general contractor is **not** the party submitting the permit application.

                                   Questions regarding contractor validation forms may be submitted to [permits@addisontx.gov](mailto:permits@addisontx.gov).
