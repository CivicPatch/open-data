De Zavala Project
=================

* De Zavala Project



![Resized_20260113_144658](http://www.shavanoparktx.gov/De%20Zavala%20Project/Resized_20260113_144658.jpeg?t=202601151054510)
Residents, De Zavala Project in total has about 180 days left and is 50% complete. Road remains open with only temporary stoppages by road flaggers. J3 completed curb trenching on north side since resuming work on January 5th. Next three weeks the concrete headwalls, curb inlets, sidewalk and driveways all gets installed on north side. The embankment at the business park near De Zavala is complete, and awaiting new sprinklers then topsoil, seed and blanket to establish grass.  Construction of the new environmentally friendly
overflow parking behind City Hall is scheduled to start week of Jan 26. See our FAQ on at bottom of page for information on the overflow parking.
Residents, asphalt laying on the south side of De Zavala is complete and traffic was flipped to the south side onto the new asphalt. Before work shutdown for Winter Holidays between December 23rd and January 5th, the contractor plans to mill down the north side asphalt and shave down the hill near Bikeway. Finally new asphalt will be laid down where the hill was shaved. The road remains open but expect short delays by road flaggers. Again, no construction on De Zavala will occur between 12PM December 23rd and January 5th for Winter Holidays.
Residents, the next major road reconstruction project will be on De Zavala Road using $4M in Federal Funding awarded by the U.S. Congress (an earmark) after support from our U.S. Representative Tony Gonzales (TX-23).
Project will begin in
**July 14, 2025**
and take 1 year to complete. The contractor J3 Company was awarded the contract to perform the work.

This project will accomplish a number of improvements, the biggest will be the installation of a large pipe underneath De Zavala to capture water flowing off the Municipal Tract and carry it under the road to the Olmos basin (the De Zavala bridge area). This is projected to significantly reduce storm water runoff for homes on Ripple Creek and Painted Post to the south. See FAQ for detailed exhibit. This project will also expand De Zavala to add raised curb with sidewalks, dedicated bike lanes and safety buffers between traffic and bicyclists sharing the road. The road will be milled and overlayed to provide fresh asphalt, and those areas demolished to install the pipe under the road completely reconstructed. See Exhibit 1 and 2 for how De Zavala is planned change with this project.

Another major safety improvement will be accomplished by the project for residents at the Bikeway and De Zavala intersection by shaving down the hill immediately to the west of the intersection to improve sight lines. By shaving off 1 ½ feet off the hill, sight lines will be improved by an additional 62 feet to the west for drivers at Bikeway & De Zavala intersection. See FAQ below for a detailed exhibit.
Finally this project will provide some safer and improved street adjacent parking in the road shoulder on the north side on the Municipal Tract.

Project will begin July 14, 2025. Total construction time is estimated to take 12 months.

This project is being funded by $4M in Federal Funding awarded by U.S. Congress (an earmark) after support from our U.S. Representative Tony Gonzales (TX-23).

The 54 inch culvert installed under De Zavala is predicted to significantly reduce storm water runoff for homes along Ripple Creek and Painted Post by diverting water runoff from the Municipal Tract and carrying it under De Zavala directly to the Olmos basin (near De Zavala bridge).

There are minimal utility relocates required for this project. CPS Energy has already relocated gas mains in 2023. Shavano Park Water Utility has two water main crossings under De Zavala that will be relocated. All electrical utility and fiber internet conflicts are avoided by the project.
