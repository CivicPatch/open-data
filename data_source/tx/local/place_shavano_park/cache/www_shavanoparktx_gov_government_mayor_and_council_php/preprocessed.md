Mayor & City Council
====================

* [Home](https://www.shavanoparktx.gov/)
* [Government](https://www.shavanoparktx.gov/government/index.php)
* Mayor and Council



A Mayor and five City Aldermen of the City Council are elected at-large to their positions by the voters and serve the entire City, not a geographic precinct. They each serve two-year staggered terms.

A Mayor Pro-Tem is appointed annually by Council Members. The City Council’s primary responsibility is to set policy and provide oversight of the municipal organization. Examples of activity include the adoption of the City’s yearly budget and the various policies the Council sets at public meetings.

The Mayor and City Council Members are volunteers, who give of themselves and sacrifice time with their families in order to do the business of the City. They receive no pay for their time. Therefore, we ask for your patience as we deal with each issue in as timely a manner as possible.

**Mayor Bob Werner**
[Email](mailto:mayor@shavanopark.org)
![Mayor Bob Werner](https://www.shavanoparktx.gov/MayorWerner.jpg?t=202507080846160 "MayorWerner")

Mayor Robert B. (“Bob”) Werner was elected mayor in May 2015. He began serving Shavano Park in 1994 as an alternate member of the Board of Adjustments, and in 1995, City Council appointed him as a member of the Planning and Zoning Commission, where he had served as a member and then chair for most of the next 20+ years. In 1999, Bob was first elected to the City Council and re-elected in 2001. On leaving City Council, City Council immediately returned him to the Planning and Zoning Commission, where his appointment was bi-annually renewed, and he served as its chair until the May 2015 election.
Enhancement of community services, growth in residential and commercial property values and
management of clean commercial property development in Shavano Park have been the hallmark of the last 30+ years. Along with hundreds of volunteers and dozens of community leaders, Bob has rolled up his sleeves to change the outside opinions of Shavano Park. The elevation of Shavano Park as a recognized community includes recognition in the December 2014 issue of Business Insider as one of the 25 Most Affluent Communities in America, 2016 “Tree City USA” recognition and 2015 “Scenic City” recognition. In the fall of 2018, the City of Shavano Park was recognized as the fourth community certified by the National Wildlife Federation as a certified “Community Wildlife Habitat.”
Bob is also active in the community as a volunteer in many organizations, with over 20 years of continual service as a Children’s or Youth Ministry Teacher at University United Methodist Church including 25 years of service as a Youth Ministry Leader. In 2023, Bob joined the Kairos prison ministry team working in the John B. Connally unit outside Kenedy, Texas, and within Connally Kairos, Bob serves as the team in church outreach. As a team member, Bob visits the men in white two to three days each month. Additionally, Bob previously served as a board member to the Hollomon Price Foundation, whose purpose is protection, preservation, and reclamation of the Earth by supporting charitable non-profit entities focused on protecting and preserving people, plants, animals and natural systems for present and future generations. Finally, prior to the graduation of his children from Tom C. Clark High School, Bob was also the Boy Scout Troop 66 Committee Chair (where his two sons achieved the rank of Eagle Scout), a member of the Clark band pit crew and a perennial girls youth basketball coach. In recognition for his community service, Bob received Home Town Hero recognition (Time Warner Cable City of Shavano Park 2003), and he was honored to receive a Mayor’s Shavano Park 50 Year Award (as a difference maker in Shavano Park).
Bob’s professional background includes his recent solo law practice, over 25 years as a shareholder with the San Antonio based law firm of Langley & Banack, over 40 years as a licensed Texas Certified Public Accountant and over 40 years as a licensed Texas attorney.
The Fredericksburg, Texas native is married to Mary Werner, his wife for almost 40 years. Mary works as a Texas Certified Guardian supervising care under Texas probate court supervision for those unable to care for themselves. Along with her business partners, she supervises the care and/or manages decedents estates for around 100 incapacitated persons or estates of decedents. With Bob, Mary shares a passion for Shavano Park community service and excellence. (Bob and Mary have three children – Robert Blake Werner, Jr., M.D. (Psychiatrist in New Haven, Connecticut), Stewart Taylor Werner (Vice President, Financial Consultant and Certified Financial Planner, Charles Schwab in San Antonio, Texas) and Kristina Conway Werner (CPA - Department of Defense in San Antonio, Texas)).
In 1979, Bob graduated with high honors from Texas Tech University with a degree in accounting. In 1983, he graduated from the Texas Tech University School of Law. In 1984, he graduated with a Master of Law (LL.M.) in Taxation from the University of Florida at Gainesville.

**Alderman Maggi Kautz**

**Alderman Pete Miller**
[Email](mailto:pmiller@shavanopark.org)
![230409 - Ald Miller](https://www.shavanoparktx.gov/Council/230409%20-%20Ald%20Miller.jpg?t=202507080845510)
Pete was elected to City Council in May of 2021.  He is a strong proponent of supporting Shavano Park’s vision of being the premier community in Bexar County by preserving and celebrating its natural settings and its small-town traditions.  He believes this is accomplished by ensuring the effective implementation of our Town Plan, safeguarding our infrastructure through continuous improvement, fostering a safe and family-oriented environment, and keeping City Hall as a center of our community.

Although Pete is a relatively new resident to Shavano Park, his family history runs deep in this area.  His great, great-grandfather, F.I. Meyer, was a founding member of San Antonio in the mid to late 1800’s, where he helped to establish Saint Joseph’s Church in downtown San Antonio.  Additionally, he was also a member of the first volunteer fire department.

Pete and his wife have one daughter. They moved to Shavano Park to be closer to her and her family which includes their granddaughter, the newest member of the family, born in 2019.  They feel blessed to live in Shavano Park so that they can be part of her life and spend quality time watching her grow.

Pete graduated from Texas A&M with a degree in Electrical Engineering where he and his wife of 39 years met.  After graduation, he went to work for ConocoPhillips, a Fortune 500 Company.  His 34-year career with the company allowed them to live in different parts of the US, which in addition to Texas, included cities in Louisiana, California, and Oklahoma.   His career exposed him to a wide range of opportunities including the design and installation of large projects, negotiating global agreements, and managing multidisciplined groups.  Pete worked at the ConocoPhillips’ corporate office in Houston for over 10 years and oversaw a group that monitored the Company’s global operations.  In this position, he had the opportunity to travel to many parts of the world where he learned to appreciate the strength that diversity brings.

**Alderman Lee Powers

Lee and wife Kathryn have lived in Shavano Park for over 30 years.  Lee has been involved with Shavano Park since the late 1960’s. He was working with Bell Telephone and helped re-map Shavano Park’s phone service from the Central Office still located next to the fire house.  As a new Police Officer in 1976, he was detailed to the Shavano Park City Hall (now the Fire Department offices) to keep the peace during a tumultuous City Council meeting.
Lee Powers graduated from O. W. Holmes H.S., attended St. Mary’s university, and graduated from Wayland Baptist University with a degree in Criminal Justice.  Retired from Balcones Heights after nearly 27 years in public safety, he is now the Qualified Manager of a Security company with over 85 employees, and maintains his police credentials by working part time with the Helotes Police Department.
