Mayor & Council
===============

Taylor Lake Village was incorporated in 1961 as a General Law Type A form of government.
The City elects a Mayor and five City Council Members for two-year terms. Elections for Mayor and Council Positions 2 and 4 are held in odd numbered years, and elections for Council Positions 1, 3, and 5 are elected in even numbered years. Councilmembers are elected at-large by all registered voter residents of the City.

City Council meetings are held in city hall at 6:30pm on the first or third Wednesday of the month. On rare occasions, a special meeting will have to be called in order to meet the required quorum. Meeting notices are posted on the TLV website and in front of City Hall three business days in advance as required by the Texas Open Meetings Act.
