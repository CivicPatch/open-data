Councilperson District 5 Jay Martin
===================================

Councilperson Jay Martin has been a resident of La Porte since 1962, a lifelong Texan whose parents were also active locally (his mother retired from LPISD and his father was a businessman on Main Street). Martin is currently a Global Key Account Manager for Kennametal, Inc., developing solutions with select partners in the oil and gas and energy business sectors, bringing along his deep experience in industrial sales, with emphases on tungsten carbide tooling, and tungsten engineered components and surface technology wear solutions.  
  
As a member of Council, Martin has served on the Economic Development Corporation (4B) Board, the Fiscal Affairs Committee, Drainage and Flooding Committee, is a former Mayor Pro Tem, participates in Texas Municipal League training (and has attended every annual conference since his election in 2010), and represents the City through his participation with the Harris County Mayors and Councilmembers Association (HCMCA) and its Nomination Subcommittee to fill positions to the Houston Ship Channel Security District, the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership (BAHEP), and was a past City appointee to the Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau.  
  
Councilperson Martin has been active in addressing local issues, including the following:  organizing local opposition to the Biggert–Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (resulting in HR 3370, an amended version signed into law in March 2014, which caps flood insurance premiums and repealed FEMA’s authority to raise flood insurance rates at the time of property sale); efforts to establish a golf cart ordinance, resulting in the restricted use of electric and gas golf carts within La Porte city limits; championed concerns about smoking in public buildings that led to a smoking ban in city buildings and the creation of a more restrictive non-smoking ordinance in La Porte; continually in communication with the Port of Houston to improve and strengthen community relationships and to ensure they remain committed to implementing new solutions to noise and air pollution issues emanating from the Bayport container terminal; has pushed for residential development on Wharton Weems Road resulting in over 90 beautiful new homes in District 5; opposes permissive "Heavy Haul" legislation and supports roadway restrictions for 18-wheelers within La Porte’s city limits; supports regional efforts to build the "Ike Dike" and see it as the ultimate solution to storm surge devastation within the Galveston Bay region; is active in various other projects in La Porte and District 5, including street and sidewalk repair, ordinance and code enforcement, permitting, homeowner’s association functions, and the support and planning of capital improvement projects; active in supporting the La Porte Chamber of Commerce and their activities; support the efforts of the Friends of the Pavilion; and active in support of the activities and purpose of the Economic Alliance Houston Port Region.  
  
Martin is married to Gail, a retired LPISD teacher and community volunteer. Together they raised three sons (Jeff is the President of the La Porte-Bayshore Chamber of Commerce) and enjoy spending time with them, their daughter-in-law (an LPISD counselor), and their two grandsons. The Martins are active at the First United Methodist Church of La Porte. Councilperson Martin urges La Porte residents, especially those in District 5, to contact him with their concerns and interests about the community.
