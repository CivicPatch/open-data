Mayor Rick Helton
=================

Mayor Rick Helton is a long-time community leader with deep roots in the La Porte area. He grew up in Pasadena and graduated from Deer Park High School, now having proudly calling La Porte home for over twenty years. He and his wife, an LPISD educator of more than two decades, raised their children in the La Porte community and saw their son reflect the family’s strong commitment to public service over five years with the La Porte VFD.

Professionally, Rick is a cornerstone of the local economic network, leading Amegy Bank’s La Porte branch. His expertise in banking and his ability to build relationships have supported financial growth and stability for residents and businesses across the community. Knowing La Porte's value locally and regionally, he is always pleased to share with others La Porte's prime position between the Gulf's two largest container terminals, which account for 97% of the container movements in the Gulf, and over 4 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent containers) annually. In 2024, total containers passing through La Porte (imports and exports) was valued at $223.5 billion; or $4.3 billion dollars of goods passing through La Porte each week.

Rick is actively involved in many community organizations, including the La Porte Rotary Club and the Root to Fruit Foundation, and has previously served on the boards of La Porte Education Foundation and the La Porte-Bayshore Chamber of Commerce. His long-standing involvement in nonprofit and civic groups underscores his commitment to giving back and helping La Porte continue to thrive. Rick’s dedication to La Porte extends well beyond his career. He has served the city in multiple leadership roles, including two years on City Council representing District 4, and was elected Mayor in May 2024. His approach to leadership is grounded in service and collaboration.

Mayor Rick Helton remains focused on strengthening community resilience, supporting local families, and ensuring La Porte remains a safe and welcoming place to live, work, and visit.
