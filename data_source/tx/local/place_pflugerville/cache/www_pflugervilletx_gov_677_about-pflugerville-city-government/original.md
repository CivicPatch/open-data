### Texas Municipal League

The city of Pflugerville is a member of the Texas Municipal League, an organization of more than 16,000 city government employees and elected officials. The league is voluntary and open to any city in Texas and provides advocacy, legal support, training and resources. The City of Pflugerville supports the [Our Home, Our Decisions campaign](https://www.tml.org/366/Our-Home-Our-Decisions) that aims to raise awareness about the State of Texas eroding the ability of Texans to have a voice in developing local solutions to local problems that affect their neighborhoods and their communities. Texas is a big state and decisions at the Capitol that affect local cities are not one size fits all. What works in Pflugerville may not work for residents in another city. The Council agreed that it is important to educate residents on the issues taking place at the State Capitol that affect Pflugerville and other cities.
