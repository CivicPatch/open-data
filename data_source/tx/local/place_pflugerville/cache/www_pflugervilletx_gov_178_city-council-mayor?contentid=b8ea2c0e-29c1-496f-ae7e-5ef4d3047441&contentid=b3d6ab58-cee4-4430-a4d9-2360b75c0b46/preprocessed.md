City Mayor

City Council and Mayor

**Term Expires**
: 2026 to 2028

Doug Weiss was born and raised in the North Dallas suburb of Plano.  He graduated from Plano Senior High School in 1997, where he was an active member of the choir, the sound and lighting technician for the small jazz ensemble, and a strong competitor for the Business Professionals of America. Doug went on to earn his Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration from the University of Texas at Dallas.

Following his freshman year of college, Doug accepted a job with a small software company, Group 1 Software. Doug continued to work his way through college, and graduated a semester early. After college, Doug accepted a full-time position with Group 1 Software, and stayed with the company through its acquisition by Pitney Bowes.  During his 17-year tenure, he held positions that included Principal Consultant, Product Specialist, and Service Relationship Manager. He was given responsibility of four of Pitney Bowes’ top 10 clients, and maintained satisfactory reports for all of them. In 2015, Doug was recruited to join the new Business Solutions initiative at Shutterfly, where he currently manages a team responsible for delivering highly-complex solutions for large clients that drive significant revenue and production volume for the organization.

At the age of 23, Doug moved to Frisco, where he was elected president of his homeowners association a year later.  He held the line on the budget through cost savings, while he provided additional funding for neighborhood events that promoted a sense of community.

In 2008, Doug and his family moved to Pflugerville. While his wife Jessica began working on her doctorate at the University of Texas, Doug immediately sought out ways to be involved in the community.  He joined the Pflugerville Council of Neighborhood Associations and was elected as a voting representative in the Falcon Pointe HOA. Mayor Jeff Coleman appointed him to the Pflugerville Image Committee, where he served on a team that was tasked with evaluating options to promote Pflugerville throughout the metropolitan area and nationwide.

In 2009, at the age of 30, the city council appointed Doug to the Pflugerville Community Development Corporation board of directors, and in 2015 he was elected President. He  joined the Rotary Club of Pflugerville in August 2016, and just 4 months later he was nominated and elected to serve as President for Rotary Year June 2019 through July 2020. Doug is a board member of the Pflugerville Education Foundation, is a member of the Pflugerville Downtown Association, and is a member of the Friends of the Pflugerville Library.
