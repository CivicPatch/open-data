City Council and Mayor

**Term Expires**
: 2023 to 2026

The son of Haitian immigrants, Rudy is of the first generation in his family to complete higher education, graduating from not only the University of Texas College of Liberal Arts with a B.A., but also a Master in Public Affairs from the LBJ School of Public Affairs, and a Doctor of Jurisprudence from the University of Texas School of Law. He has been a tireless advocate in the community speaking and working on a host of issues ranging from teaching at-risk children, co-authoring an honor code for the University of Texas, helping forge a partnership with local law enforcement and the State Bar of Texas to address the issue of community policing, and creating Pro Bono legal advice clinics for United States Military Veterans.

Before joining Chamberlain McHaney, a premiere civil litigation law firm in Central Texas, Rudy served as Special Counsel to the Health and Human Services Commission. He has also served on several local, state, and national boards and committees including the Board of Directors of the State Bar of Texas, Lone Star Circle of Care, Texans Soccer Club, Leadership Austin, Texas Young Lawyers Association, Austin Black Lawyers Association, and Young Catholic Professionals. Rudy has been recognized numerous times as one of the most influential young professionals in not only the Greater Austin area, but the State of Texas. His accolades include being awarded the Pflugerville ISD Community Partner of the Year, Texas Young Lawyers Association President’s Award of Merit, Greater Austin Black Chamber of Commerce Advocate of the Year, Austin Under 40 Government & Public Affairs Award Winner, and the Austin Area Research Organization McBee Fellowship.

Rudy’s true love and passion to the City of Pflugerville has been shown in his service as Vice President of the Travis County Emergency Services District No. 2 (Pflugerville Fire Department), a member of the Pflugerville Charter Review Commission, a member of the Pflugerville Community Development Corporation, Co-Chair of the Pflugerville Finance and Budget Committee, a member of the Pflugerville "1849" Park Committee, a member of the St. Elizabeth of Hungary FIESTA committee, and Vice Chair of the Boy Scouts of America Blackland Prairie.  Rudy is married to his amazing wife Letisha, a longtime Pflugerville resident of almost 30 years, and the father of three, yes three, daughters.

Rudy believes that true collaboration amongst stakeholders is key to keeping Pflugerville the fiscally responsible, economically strong, inclusive, and high quality of life place it is today.
