The Van City Council meets twelve times per year in a regular monthly meeting, typically held at 7 PM on the second Thursday of the month at Van CIty Hall, 310 Chestnut.

Additional meetings are held for workshops, public hearings, and as emergencies arise that require the council to gather, discuss, and take action related to the City. These meetings are posted at City Hall and published to the caledar located on the City website. Meeting files are available to the public for a period not less than 365 days after the meeting date.

We welcome you to attend or [SUBMIT A TOPIC](https://vantexas.org/2213/Topic-to-Council-Agenda) for future discussion. You can also use this form to register a comment on an agenda item and it will be forwarded to the council prior to the meeting.

For council business, contact the CIty Secretary Sereca Huggins at (903)962-7216 or by email [shuggins@vantx.gov](mailto:shuggins@vantx.gov).

The City Council is composed of  the mayor and five council members. All positions are elected at large to serve a two year term. The mayor and council places four and five are elected on even number years, with council places one, two, and three elected on odd number years. The mayor and council provide leadership and direction establishing policies and goals for the community. The council sets the tax rate, approves and adopts the annual budget, and appoints the city manager.

General law cities are usually smaller cities. General law cities don’t have charters. Rather, they operate according to specific state statutes. A general law city looks to the state constitution and state statutes to determine what it may do. If state law doesn’t grant a general law city the express or implied power to initiate a particular action, none may be taken. There are three categories of general law cities: type A, B, or C. Van is a Type A General Law city.

 There are two prevalent forms of city government in Texas:

**Mayor-Council Structure**

• The mayor is the ceremonial head of government and presides over council or board of aldermen meetings.

• The council or board of aldermen sets meetings.

 • The council or board of aldermen sets policy.

• Depending on local charter and/or ordinances, applicable statute, or local practice, broad or limited administrative authority is vested with the mayor or members of the council or board of aldermen or with an administrator or designated department heads appointed by the mayor, council, or board of aldermen.

**Council-Manager Structure**

• The mayor is the ceremonial head of government and presides over council meetings.

• The council sets policy and hires and fires the manager.

• The city manager normally has broad administrative authority

The City of Van operates under the **Council-Manager Structure**.
