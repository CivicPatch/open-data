##### Form of Government

The City of Lake Worth operates under a Council-Manager form of government with a City Council comprised of the Mayor and seven Council members. All powers of the City, and the determination of all matters of policy, are vested in the City Council. The Mayor acts as the presiding officer of the Council and represents the City at formal functions and ceremonies. The day-to-day administrative duties are carried out by the City Manager appointed by the Council.

The powers of the Council include, but are not limited to, adoption of the annual City budget, the appointment of the City Manager, City Attorney, and Municipal Judge, and provide vision and direction for all City policies and initiatives.

In Lake Worth, the Mayor and City Council are elected to two-year terms of the Mayor and Council Place numbers 2, 4, and 6 expiring in odd-numbered years and the terms of Council Place numbers 1, 3, 5, and 7 expiring in even-numbered years.

The City Council also serves as the Crime Control & Prevention District Board.

---

While there are seven (7) Council places, they are not divided into geographic districts. Each Council member is elected at-large and represents the entire community.
