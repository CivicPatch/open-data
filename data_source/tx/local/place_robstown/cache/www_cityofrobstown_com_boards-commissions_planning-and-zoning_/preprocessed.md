The Robstown Zoning Ordinance establishes the Zoning Regulations and Districts that have been made in accordance with a Comprehensive Plan for the city for the purpose of promoting Health, Safety, Morals or the General Welfare.

An application for a change of zoning requires two public hearings, one before the Planning & Zoning Commission and one before the City Council.

Please note that the Planning & Zoning Commission and City Council may conduct their public hearings over one or more meetings. The applicant or representative should be present at the hearings.

All surrounding property owners within 200 feet of the area under consideration will be notified 10 days before the Planning Commission public hearing. The notice advises property owners of their right to appear and express their opinion at the hearing, or submit written comments on the requested change.  A notice will also be placed in the Record Star newspaper 15 days before the Planning & Zoning hearing.

After considering all the facts presented at the public hearing, the Planning & Zoning Commission will take an action that is a recommendation to the City Council. The zoning request will then be forwarded to the City Secretary’s Office to be scheduled for a City Council public hearing.

**City Council Hearing**

A 75% vote majority of the City Council (4 of the 9 Council members) is required to approve the request.)
