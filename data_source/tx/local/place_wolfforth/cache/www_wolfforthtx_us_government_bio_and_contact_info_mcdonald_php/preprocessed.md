Charlotte McDonald has made her home in Wolfforth since 1989. She and her late husband Carroll were both teachers in the Frenship district. Mrs. McDonald’s teaching career spanned 30 years with the last 20 being with FISD. Other schools where she taught were McCamey, Western Texas College, and Corpus Christi Calallen. Charlotte graduated from DeLeon High School, Howard Payne College, and Texas Tech University.

Mrs. McDonald and her husband shared their Wolfforth home with their daughter Sharon, three nephews and 24 foster children over the years. Sharon and her husband Matt live in Georgia and have Charlotte’s 5 grandchildren.

Charlotte was seated on the Council in January 2022, and her love for Wolfforth and care for the people here are the reasons she serves on the City Council. Her goal is to do all she can to make living in Wolfforth, the best place in West Texas to call HOME.
