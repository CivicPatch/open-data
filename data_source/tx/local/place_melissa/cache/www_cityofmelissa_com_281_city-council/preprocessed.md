Mayor's Message
===============

![Jay Northcut](https://www.cityofmelissa.com/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=1095)

Greetings! I’m in my first term as Mayor of Melissa, and truth be told, it could not be a more exciting time to live in this incredible community.

Our city administration is recognized among the most efficient in the area, with an employee/resident ratio among the lowest in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area. Yet, our level of municipal service remains near the top of our peer cities, even those with larger workforces. Our City Manager, Jason Little, is a seasoned professional who is recognized for his out-of-the-box innovation and inclusive managerial style.

Your Public Works Department works hard every day to provide a reliable, safe, and dependable source of water, clean and modern streets, and infrastructure that is proactively and responsibly maintained. Not to mention our police and fire personnel are second to none, constantly winning official recognition from their counterparts across the state. City finances are dealt with in a conservative, professional manner, with expenditures closely watched and investments expertly managed. Utilities and solid waste services are carefully monitored, ensuring that service levels remain at the highest possible levels.

We try to communicate often and accurately through tools like the Melissa Minute - if you haven’t subscribed yet, we hope you’ll
consider doing so

It truly is an exciting time to live in Melissa. If I can answer any questions or provide you with information, please do not hesitate to

. We love having each of you as members of this community and look forward to seeing you around town!
