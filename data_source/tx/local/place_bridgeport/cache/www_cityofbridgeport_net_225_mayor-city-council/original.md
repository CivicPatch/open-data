Randy Singleton, Mayor
----------------------

Randy Singleton was elected Mayor of the City of Bridgeport in May 2016. Mayor Singleton is a Bridgeport native and a 1969 graduate of Bridgeport High School. He and his wife Judy have resided at their present Bridgeport home for 25 years. Mayor Singleton is proud to call Bridgeport his home. His grandfather, Charlie Singleton, owned and operated one of the many historic coal mines that formerly dotted the area. His father, Ray Singleton, served as the Wise County Veterans Service Officer for 30 years.

Mayor Singleton retired in 2015 after a 40-year career in Law Enforcement. He was the Assistant Chief of Police for the Hurst Police Department and served that Department for 24 years. At Hurst, Mayor Singleton served in numerous capacities as Operations and Administrative Commander, National Accreditation Manager, Investigator, and Patrol Supervisor. In addition, he served several terms as the President of the Hurst Police Officers Association and one term as the President of the Texas-Arkansas-Louisiana-Oklahoma-New Mexico (TALON) regional Law Enforcement Accreditation Coalition.

After retiring from the Hurst Police Department in 2002, Mayor Singleton accepted the Police Chief position for the City of Bridgeport. Singleton led the agency to achieve State Recognition status in 2009 and again in 2013. During his tenure at the Department, then Chief Singleton led the agency's transformation to a successful community-based-oriented operation emphasizing community partnership. Singleton retired from the Department in 2015.

After retiring from the City, Mayor Singleton was appointed Chairman of the Bridgeport Charter Commission, successfully leading the commission to create a new City Charter, clearing the way for Bridgeport to become a "Home Rule" city in 2016.

As Mayor of Bridgeport, Singleton places the highest priority on Citizens. Mayor Singleton says, "We as a municipal government exist because of the citizens. Therefore, it is our distinct duty and honor to serve them with all due respect and care".
