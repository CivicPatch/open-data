Hideaway, Texas is a gated residential community located north of Interstate 20 about thirteen miles northwest of Tyler in northwestern Smith County. Hide-a-way's roots have all the elements of a rich heritage. Historically, this land was part of a large plantation settled by Richard Hubbard, Sr. and his wife Serena, who came to Texas in 1854 in a covered wagon train from central Georgia to live near Serena's family, the Carters who were already established in Texas.

The 720-acre plantation prospered for many years with Richard Hubbard, Jr. continuing after his father's death. But the allure of politics and government was too much for Richard Jr. to resist. He established his family in Tyler and proceeded to have an illustrious career in politics as Lt. Governor and later Governor of Texas. It was not until 1939 that R. W. Fair purchased the once known plantation lands of the Hubbards from family members who had inherited the land. But again it was not until 1967, when James W. Fair and his development colleagues decided to develop a community that was located within a two-hour drive from Dallas. The land had been conveyed to James Fair from his father in 1964. The developers' original design was to accommodate weekenders, with only a few permanent residents.

They acquired additional land to allow for a nine-hole golf course, an airstrip, park, a stable and home sites. Since that first big vision that James Fair had for Hide-A-Way, the community has undergone numerous changes, renovations, facelifts, and weathered many growing pains to become the community it is today. From 66 permanent residents and 139 weekenders in 1971 until today where there are over 1700 homes and over 3500 residents, Hide-A-Way is a great place to live with numerous activities from golf, tennis, to every type of game and activity; from park parties to dance clubs. It was incorporated into a city in 2001.

Hide-A-Way remains a small community that derives its endurance from its residents and their dedication to community involvement. Throughout it all, much of the breathtaking beauty of Hide-A-Way is reflected in the overall happiness of its residents at having found such a heavenly place to call home.

Hideaway initially opened its gates for lot sales on July 4, 1967.  The small community was developed by James W. Faire of Tyler, Texas and was promoted as the perfect weekend retreat for Dallas and Shreveport residents.  The property was deeded to Hide-A-Way Lake Club Inc. (the Homeowners Association) in 1969 and has been operated by the members since 1973 through a 12 member Board of Directors.

In 2001 the community incorporated to prevent being annexed by a nearby city.  The City of Hideaway has the same boundaries as the community of Hide-A-Way Lake Club Inc..  Affairs of the City of Hideaway are handled by the mayor and a board of five aldermen.  The City of Hideaway has no employees as all management, security and common property maintenance is handled by the club.

A couple of years after incorporation, the name "Hide-A-Way" became Hideaway as the club prepared for a $6 million facility upgrade program dubbed as "A New Day for Hideaway".  The Central and West golf courses were totally renovated, a new clubhouse was constructed along with a new Member Services Building and "South Gate" security house.

Today, Hideaway is home to over 3000 residents, a great majority of which make it their permanent residence.  It is home to people of all ages and walks of life.  Diversity of homes, natural beauty and rolling terrain make it one of the most picturesque places to live in all of East Texas.  The charm, kindness and friendliness of its people complement the small-town atmosphere.  Security  personnel, employed by Hideaway Lake Club Inc., man the gates, patrol the streets and protect the safety of the residents.  The amenities provide a diverse playground for everyone to enjoy.  No wonder our residents say-
