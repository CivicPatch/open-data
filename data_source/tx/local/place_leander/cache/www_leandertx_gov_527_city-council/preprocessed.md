City Council
============

To deliver fundamental services and programs that recognize and cultivate the unique characteristics of the City, generate an inviting atmosphere, and drive purpose of place and a sense of belonging.

The City of Leander is a
home-rule
municipality with a council-manager form of government. The City Council is made up of a mayor and six council members, and each are elected at-large (by all voters) for three-year staggered terms as unpaid elected officials.

Under a council-manager form of government, voters elect the Council which, in turn, hires a City Manager to administer the city’s day-to-day affairs. The Council serves as the legislative body which sets policy, approves the budget, sets the tax rate, and determines the extent and cost of municipal services. The City Manager is responsible for directing the workforce and programs of the city in accordance with ordinances, rules, and regulations adopted by the Council.
