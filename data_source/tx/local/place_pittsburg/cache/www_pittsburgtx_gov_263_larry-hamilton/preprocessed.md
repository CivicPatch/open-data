Larry Hamilton, Council Member
------------------------------

[Email Larry Hamilton](mailto:lhamilton@pittsburgtx.gov)

I am a lifelong resident of Camp Co., born and raised in a small community west of town. Graduated from Pittsburg High School and a proud member of the 1980 Pirate football team that won the school’s only state championship in football.

I am a graduate of East Texas State University now known as Texas A&M at Commerce. Married my lovely wife Carla for 32 years and counting. I retired from the Texas Workforce Commission after 33 1/2 years of service to the citizens of the great state of Texas.

Being a member of the city council is just another opportunity to serve the citizens of Texas and my local community.
