Biography
---------

I was born in Paris, Texas but grew up in Dallas. After high school graduation, I attended Dallas Baptist University and The University of North Texas at Denton, which was interrupted in June of 1971, to serve in the United States Naval Air Reserve. Upon completing active duty, I returned to Dallas Baptist University to complete my education. In 1973, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business Administration and a minor in Psychology.

While working in a family business for 20 years, I decided on a career change and entered the field of insurance in 1992. Working with a major insurance company in the Dallas area, I specialized in life insurance and financial planning. In 2001, State Farm Insurance Company recruited me to become a Life Sales Specialist with the anticipation of becoming a State Farm agent. In October 2003,

Linda and I moved to Pittsburg to begin a new chapter in our lives in a wonderful East Texas town with the friendliest people.

Linda and I are active members of First Baptist Church of Pittsburg. I have served on the Pittsburg Chamber of Commerce Board, a member of the [Main Street Board](https://www.pittsburgtx.gov/271/Main-Street-Board), a member of the [Planning and Zoning Commission](https://www.pittsburgtx.gov/272/Planning-Zoning-Commission), a member of the [Home Rule Commission](https://www.pittsburgtx.gov/186/Home-Rule-Charter) and a member of the Pittsburg Rotary Club. Recently, I was elected to the Pittsburg City Council where I hope I can be a part of the economic growth and development of our city. I trust the City Council will strive to make a positive influence in the lives of the citizens of Pittsburg, Texas.

It is our pleasure to work and live in Pittsburg and enjoy many years in a town we consider our home.
