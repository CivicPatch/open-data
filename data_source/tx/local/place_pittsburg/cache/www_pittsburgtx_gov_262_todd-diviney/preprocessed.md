My wife, Beverly and I moved to Pittsburg in 1990 and we have always considered Pittsburg home. We were both born and raised in different towns, but we couldn't have chosen a better place to call home and raise our three children. I have been involved, throughout the years, with various organizations and functions. I wanted to give back to my community in a way that will hopefully be a positive impact for years to come. So, in 2018, I made the decision run for City Council. As an elected official, I strive to continue the efforts of economic growth and future development of our city. While continuing to make a positive impact in the lives of the citizens of Pittsburg, Texas.
