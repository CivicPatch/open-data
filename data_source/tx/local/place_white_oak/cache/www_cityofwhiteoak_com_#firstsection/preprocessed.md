**Once simply a bedroom community to Longview, White Oak has matured into a city that offers modern services and conveniences, while maintaining the friendliness and tranquility for which it has always been known.**

**White Oak remains a small town (the current population per the 2020 census is 6,225), with its advantageous location just west of Longview, White Oak residents are able to enjoy small town living and still conveniently take advantage of cultural and shopping opportunities in a large metropolitan area.**
