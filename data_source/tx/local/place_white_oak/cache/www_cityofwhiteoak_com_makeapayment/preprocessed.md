Utility bills are due on the 10th day of every month. If the 10th falls on a weekend or holiday, the due date is extended until the next regular business day. Accounts with a past due balance after the 10th of the month are subject to a 10% late penalty.
Disconnections for non-payment is performed as soon as practical on or after the 20th of each month. If you are disconnected for non-payment, it is illegal to turn the water meter back on yourself and there is a $225 water meter tampering fee for doing so. In order to re-establish water service, the customer must pay a $50 reconnect fee. Payments must be in the office no later than 7:30 a.m. the morning of cutoff in order to avoid service interruption.  Payments deposited after 7:30 a.m. will be posted the next business day.
