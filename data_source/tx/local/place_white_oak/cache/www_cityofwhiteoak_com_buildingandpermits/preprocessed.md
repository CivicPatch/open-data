**The mission of the Building Inspection Department is to make sure that all buildings in the City of White Oak are as safe as possible for all citizens, to ensure that all citizens are treated with respect and that inspections are consistent and timely. Permits are required for new construction, remodeling, additions, plumbing, and electrical work. The City of White Oak values its residents and enforces the adopted building codes as a means to protect residents from substandard buildings.**
The Building Inspection Department is responsible for enforcement of various City codes relating to the construction of property within the White Oak city limits. Inspections are made to ensure compliance with city, state, and federal regulations regarding the construction of residential and commercial property. The building inspector issues permits for construction, plumbing, electrical, sign installation, moving of homes, demolition, driveway approaches, swimming pools, and certificates of occupancy. The City of White Oak conducts inspections based on the following adopted codes:

* 2018 International Fire Code
* 2018 International Residential Code
* 2018 International Building Code
* 2018 International Fuel Gas Code
* 2018 International Mechanical Code
* 2018 International Property Maintenance Code
* 2018 International Plumbing Code

A change in occupancy of any building or structure is not allowed until a Certificate of Occupancy (also called a safety permit) has been issued by the building inspector or his/her designee according to Section 11 of the City of White Oak's
[Zoning Ordinance](https://www.cityofwhiteoak.com/resources?def2=kj60gFwgFkHKgr5XuNHDUw%3D%3D)
. This safety inspection is required before electricity service is connected. This process is the way our citizens have a safe living environment and certifies the building is in compliance with the City's adopted building codes. The cost of the safety inspection is $30. Contact Maureen Carrigan at City Hall for scheduling (903) 759-3936 or
