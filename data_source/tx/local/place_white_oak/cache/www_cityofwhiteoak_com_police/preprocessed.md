Brannon Robertson

(903) 759-0106

brobertson@cityofwhiteoak.com

103 E. Old Highway 80, White Oak TX, 75693

Chief Robertson graduated from Sabine High School in 1993. He immediately began the Criminal Justice program at Kilgore College where he earned his Associates Degree. He also attended the Kilgore College Police Academy in the summer of 1996. Upon completion he took his first law enforcement related job at the Gregg County Sheriff’s Office as a Reserve Deputy in August of that same year. In October of 1996 he became a Reserve Officer for the Gladewater Police Department and put in his time waiting for a full time patrol position to come open. By April of 1999 he became a full time employee. During his time in Gladewater he earned an award from M.A.D.D. and was recognized by the Gladewater City Council for his work in DWI enforcement. In April of 2003 the opportunity came for him to come to work at the White Oak Police Department and he took it. He has been here ever since. He became an Intoxilyzer Operator in 2003 for the Agency and he continued his work as a DWI enforcer. By 2004 his efforts led to the White Oak Police Department making more DWI arrests and obtaining more convictions than many wet cities in the area, some with even more than double White Oak’s population. In 2008 he was promoted to Patrol Sergeant where he worked until November of 2015 when he promoted to Patrol Lieutenant. During his time in White Oak he earned his Intermediate and Advanced Peace Officer Licenses and by August of 2008, he had earned his Master P.O. License. Over an 8 month period he structuralized the White Oak Police Department Policy and put it into practice. The Agency was able to earn Recognized Status from the Texas Police Chief’s Association in March of 2012. Out of the more than 1900 law enforcement agencies in Texas, White Oak was only the 66th agency to earn that status. The agency has maintained this distinction since and in July of 2016 earned re-recognition. Chief Robertson earned Officer of the Year awards in 2004 and 2012. He was appointed Chief of Police in April 2025. One of Chief Robertson’s favorite tasks is organizing the Halloween celebration every year by structuring the traffic to maximize safety and efficiency for one of the busiest trick-or-treat neighborhoods in East Texas. He did this after far too many close calls and dead-locked traffic snarls that would not allow emergency vehicles access to an entire neighborhood. These things are no longer an issue and Halloween continues to grow into a bigger and bigger success every year in White Oak.

Lt. Nicholas Bruton

Lt. Bruton graduated from Barber’s Hill High School in Mont Belvieu, TX, in 2005. He then attended the Texas School of Massage, where he earned his masseuse license in 2006. Fortunately for us, he decided his career should be in law enforcement, and he attended the East Texas Police Academy, where he graduated in 2013. That same year, he was hired on at the Gladewater Police Department, where he worked for more than 5 years. In that time, he earned the position of Detective. He developed quite an impressive portfolio of certificates, licenses, and specializations on anything related to criminal investigation. While in Gladewater, he also attained the rank of sergeant, where he kept a tidy ship, and administrators there knew he could be trusted. In 2019, he decided to take a break from police work and went into the private sector for a short time. The job was still in his blood, however, and he asked to be added to the roster of the White Oak Police Department as a reserve in March of 2019. A short 2 months later, an opening came up at this agency, and his application showed up shortly after. He was hired and zipped through the Field Training with ease. In his short time here, he has shown a level-headed decision-making ability, and his hard work was quickly noticed. Because of good, hard work, he was promoted to sergeant and ran one of the night shifts. In December of 2022, Lt. Bruton earned his Advanced Peace Officer License. In November of 2023, he was promoted to Lt., where he oversees dispatch and handles day-to-day IT processes in the department. In April of 2025, Lt. Bruton took on the additional role of patrol Lt. and now oversees patrol operations and procedures. In December 2025, Lt. Bruton earned his associate's degree in criminal justice as well as his master Peace Officer License. He continues to work on gaining valuable knowledge and takes every opportunity he can to hone his talents into a very valuable asset for White Oak.

Ellis is relentless in his investigations, and he is known as an investigator who won’t quit until the job is done. As long as a case is open, he will be putting in the effort to close it. All officers here know that if they can’t complete a case on their own, it will no doubt be put in good hands.

After a few years of excellent service, he promoted to corporal. He then spent a couple of years in the private sector but felt the calling of law enforcement once again. The City of White Oak crossed his radar and the Police Department just happened to be in need of an officer at that moment. The rest is history. His hard work and drive were quickly noticed and in 2024 he was promoted to Corporal. We are fortunate to have his experience on the payroll.

Officer Travis Gibbens

Officer Gibbens is a graduate of Heavener High School in Oklahoma. He spent years in the U.S. Army and, while doing so, served honorably in the regions of Kuwait and Iraq. Upon closing out that chapter in his life, he decided law enforcement was the way to go. He had experience at both municipal and county agencies while in Oklahoma in different capacities. He spent time as a jailer, an animal control officer, and a police officer during his time there. In 2019, he moved to the Houston, TX area and attended and graduated the Alvin Police Academy in Alvin, TX. By 2021, Officer Gibbens went to work in the Houston area at the Iowa Colony Police Department. During his service there, he was awarded a Life-Saving award as well as earning Officer of the Year for both the Iowa Colony P.D. and Brazoria County-wide 100 Club. That was based, in part, on a harrowing life-saving event. He recently moved to North East Texas and the timing for White Oak was perfect as he was looking to start a career in this region at the exact moment the White Oak Police Department had begun a search for a new officer. Officer Gibbens’ experience, work ethic, knowledge, and skills will be on display for the City of White Oak and we are all excited to see what the future holds for him and us.

Because of that, he makes White Oak safer and is an attribute to the Department. Officer Templeton says he strives to be thought of as a community policing oriented officer. In September of 2018 Officer Templeton was granted his Advanced Peace Officer License.

Officer Still is a 2006 graduate of Longview High School. He graduated from the East Texas Police Academy in 2009 and was hired in White Oak in that same year and has worked here since. He holds a LEBA (bike patrol) certification which means he may utilize a bicycle to execute regular street patrols and also provide security presence at special events around the city. He is one of only two officers in the agency with such a certification. He was instrumental in developing the bike patrol program for the agency. Due to Officer Still’s attention to details and willingness to assist, he was also appointed to be responsible for the capital assets for the White Oak Police Department. That is one of the requirements the Department must maintain in order to keep its recognized status with the Texas Police Chiefs’ Association. Officer Still also took the lead in efforts to develop land for the City of White Oak in the creation of a walking / mountain biking trail. The idea became a reality and the bike trail is in full use and quickly became a popular destination for mountain bike enthusiasts from all over the area. In August of 2020, Officer Still obtained his Advanced Peace Officers License.

Dispatcher Evans began working for the White Oak Police Department in April 2025. She came highly recommended by other dispatchers and officers who had worked with her in the past.

She is a hard worker and shows terrific drive when it comes to taking on tasks and getting her many duties done in a timely and very accurate manner. The citizens of White Oak can be comforted knowing that in their time of need, her voice will be one heard when they call for help.

TCO Carolyn Smith

Dispatcher Smith graduated from Union Grove High School in 1980 and immediately upon graduation attended Kilgore College. In 1981 she obtained her first law enforcement job as a dispatcher for the Gladewater Police Department and worked there until 1982 when she married and moved to Oklahoma. It wasn’t long before East Texas summoned her back home that same year. In the early 1990s she continued her life of public service by working for the Union Grove Volunteer Fire Department where she also became certified as an EMT. She continued that work until the late 1990s. During that period she returned to work as a fulltime dispatcher, again, for the Gladewater Police Department. After moving to the Dallas area she began working at the Balch Springs Police Department in 2001. Just like it does with all of us, East Texas once again called her home and in 2009 began working for the White Oak Police Department as a dispatcher. She has been here ever since. She holds a Master Telecommunications certificate and has received Active Shooter Crisis training. She is a proud mother, and grandmother. No one cares more for their officers than TCO Smith and officers here know that when she is at the helm, they are in good hands.

Dispatcher Laci Pepper graduated from Union Grove High School in Gladewater in 2006. After attending Kilgore College she began working at the Gregg County Sheriff’s Department in 2008 as a jailer. She received training as a corrections officer in Canton, TX and at one point worked as a trainer for incoming jailers for Gregg County. She came to work at the White Oak Police Department in March of 2016 as a dispatcher and has been here since. She has since earned her Master Communications certificate. She lives in White Oak as a proud mother with her husband and children. In her time at White Oak she has proven to be a valuable member of the agency. She is well known for always being friendly and brings cheer to everyone around her. She is also thorough in her work and helps keep our officers safe.

On March 19th, 2012, the White Oak Police Department became only the 66th “Recognized” police agency by the Texas Police Chiefs Association. Begun in 2007, the Recognition Program evaluates a Police Department’s compliance with over 160 Best Practices for Texas Law Enforcement. These Best Practices were carefully developed by Texas Law Enforcement professionals to assist agencies in the efficient and effective delivery of service and the protection of individual’s rights. They cover all aspects of law enforcement operations including use of force, protection of citizen rights, vehicle pursuits, property and evidence management, and patrol and investigative operations.
This voluntary process required the White Oak Police Department to conduct a critical self-review of the agency’s policies, procedures, facilities, and operations. Beginning in 2011, the department began the lengthy process of becoming a “Recognized Law Enforcement Agency” by preparing proofs of compliance for each of the Texas Law Enforcement Best Business Practices. Upon completion of the internal review, an outside audit and review was requested. The on-site review was conducted by trained Police Chiefs from other areas of our state. The result of this review was then sent to the Texas Police Chiefs Association’s Recognition Committee for final analysis and decision to award “Recognized” status. The White Oak Police Department has maintained “Recognized” status by submitting annual reports and being audited again in 2016, 2020, and 2024.
