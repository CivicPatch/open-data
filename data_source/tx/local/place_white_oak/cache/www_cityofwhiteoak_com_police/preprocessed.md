On March 19th, 2012, the White Oak Police Department became only the 66th “Recognized” police agency by the Texas Police Chiefs Association. Begun in 2007, the Recognition Program evaluates a Police Department’s compliance with over 160 Best Practices for Texas Law Enforcement. These Best Practices were carefully developed by Texas Law Enforcement professionals to assist agencies in the efficient and effective delivery of service and the protection of individual’s rights. They cover all aspects of law enforcement operations including use of force, protection of citizen rights, vehicle pursuits, property and evidence management, and patrol and investigative operations.
This voluntary process required the White Oak Police Department to conduct a critical self-review of the agency’s policies, procedures, facilities, and operations. Beginning in 2011, the department began the lengthy process of becoming a “Recognized Law Enforcement Agency” by preparing proofs of compliance for each of the Texas Law Enforcement Best Business Practices. Upon completion of the internal review, an outside audit and review was requested. The on-site review was conducted by trained Police Chiefs from other areas of our state. The result of this review was then sent to the Texas Police Chiefs Association’s Recognition Committee for final analysis and decision to award “Recognized” status. The White Oak Police Department has maintained “Recognized” status by submitting annual reports and being audited again in 2016, 2020, and 2024.
