     If you provide any information (which, for these purposes, includes any personal information (defined in our Privacy Policy) and any other confidential or proprietary information) to us, you agree to provide only true, accurate, current and complete information. If you provide information to us about any third party, you represent and warrant that you are specifically authorized to provide such information to us so that we may use, process and transfer such information in connection with your use of the Service in accordance with the Terms of Service. You assume all responsibility for your dissemination and use of the information you provide to us in connection with the Service. We will handle such information in accordance with our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated herein by reference.

    Each Authorized User hereby acknowledges that Customer may have submitted personal information about him/her to the Service. Each Authorized User further acknowledges that (a) Customer has the right to (i) access, view, use and copy any content entered or uploaded by such Authorized User on the Service ("User Content"); (ii) control his/her access to User Content and Customer Content (including the length of time that such User Content and/or Customer Content remains accessible on the Service); and (iii) terminate and/or suspend his or her access to the User Account, and (b) certain User Content and Customer Content (e.g., that included in a membership directory) may be made available to other Authorized Users.
   </li>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <p>
      Customers and/or their Authorized Users retain ownership of and responsibility for all Customer Content and/or User Content (including personal information) that Customers or Authorized Users upload or otherwise submit to the Service. No right, title or interest in any Customer Content or User Content is transferred to or vests in MembershipWare; however, you authorize MembershipWare to use and display such Customer Content and/or User Content (in whole or part) as necessary to provide the Service. For the sake of clarity, certain Customer Content uploaded or otherwise submitted to the Service will be displayed for Authorized Users of User Accounts issued under the applicable Customer Account whom the Customer authorizes to view such Customer Content.
     </p>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li>
     To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may assess a late charge equal to the lesser of 1% of the unpaid amount each month or the maximum rate permitted by law if Customer does not pay on time. Customer must pay these late charges when we bill for them. We may suspend or cancel access to the Service (for Customer and Customer’s Authorized Users) if Customer fails to pay in full and on time. Customer will reimburse MembershipWare for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in collecting any overdue amounts.
    </li>
    <li>
     If Customer designates a credit card or debit card to make payments, Customer hereby agrees that MembershipWare (or its applicable payment processor) is authorized to charge Customer's designated card on the applicable due date. If MembershipWare (or its applicable payment processor) does not receive payment from the applicable card issuer or its agents, or if payment made by bank draft or other means is not honored, Customer agrees to pay all amounts due immediately upon demand. Customer agrees to keep the account number and expiration date of Customer's designated card and Customer's billing address updated at all times.

   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Unless we agree otherwise in writing, the term of a Customer's subscription to use the Service ("
     ") shall commence on the date we accept (or accepted) Customer's subscription request by notifying Customer of such acceptance and shall continue until the end of the acceptance month plus one (1) month (the initial partial month plus one month is the "
     "); subject, however, to renewal and earlier termination as provided herein. Upon the expiration of the Subscription Period and each Renewal Period, if any, the term of the Subscription shall automatically renew for successive periods of one (1) month each (each such one month is a "
     ") unless (a) either party gives the other party notice of its intention not to have the Subscription renew at least one (1) business day before the scheduled expiration of the then-current term, or (b) we agree otherwise in writing. All of your obligations accruing prior to termination or suspension will survive.
    </li>
    <li>
     Customer may cancel its Subscription by sending an email to contact@membershipware.com. Subject to the further provisions of this Section 7, any such termination by Customer shall be effective at the end of the then current Subscription Period or Renewal Period, as applicable.
    </li>
    <li>
     Upon termination of Customer's Subscription, (a) Customer and all of its Authorized Users cease to have access to the Service, and (b) MembershipWare may, in its sole discretion, delete all information and content (including Customer Content and User Content) in the Customer Account (including any User Account under the Customer Account); provided, however, that for ninety (90) days following termination of Customer's Subscription, the Administrator of the Customer Account may make arrangements with us to log in to the Service and download any of Customer Content and User Content associated with that Customer Account; and after 90 days we will delete the Customer Account, User Accounts associated with that Customer Account, and any related Customer Content and User Content. Customer may make such request by sending an email to contact@membershipware.com. Notwithstanding the foregoing, MembershipWare reserves the right to retain and use such information and content as necessary to comply with its legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce the Terms of Service. MembershipWare’s termination of your Subscription may also bar you from any future use of the Service.

      MembershipWare respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that your work has been copied and is accessible on the Service in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, you may notify our agent as provided in this Section 8.3. Pursuant to Title 17, United States Code, Section 512(c)(2), MembershipWare designates Copyright Agent as its agent designated to receive notification of claimed copyright infringement ("

    To the fullest extent permitted by law, but subject to the other provisions of these Terms of Service, Customer and MembershipWare each shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each other and each other's officers, directors, partners, agents, members, managers and employees from and against any and all demands, claims, damages to persons or property, losses and liabilities including reasonable attorney's fees (collectively "Claims") arising out of or caused by the indemnifying party's (or its officers’, directors’, partners’, members', agents', managers’ or employees') breach of any provision of the Terms of Service, any violation of law, or negligence, except to the extent and percentage attributable to the other party's negligence. Neither party shall have waived or be deemed to have waived, by reason of this paragraph, any defense which it may have with respect to such Claims. Nothing in the Terms of Service shall be deemed to waive any government body's sovereign immunity (to the extent applicable). To the extent the indemnification is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified person in respect of any Claims, then each indemnifying person, in lieu of indemnifying the indemnified person hereunder, shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified person, as incurred, as a result of any Claims in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by such parties from using the Service and the relative fault of the parties in connection with the act or omission that resulted in such Claim. The remedies provided for in Section 9 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified person at law or in equity.

   <li>
    IN NO EVENT SHALL MEMBERSHIPWARE OR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, PARTNERS, AGENTS, MEMBERS, MANAGERS AND EMPLOYEES (EACH, A "

In no event shall any Covered Person's total liability to you for any damages arising out of or in any way connected with these Terms of Service or the Service, whether for breach of contract, in tort or otherwise, exceed the greater of (a) one thousand two hundred fifty dollars ($1,250.00) or (b) the amount you paid to us, if any, during the twelve (12) month period immediately before the applicable claims arose. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ANY AGREED OR OTHER REMEDY OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
   </li>
   <li>
    Without limiting MembershipWare's rights under Section 7 above, upon sixty (60) days' notice by emailing registered Administrators of the affected Customer Accounts, MembershipWare may at any time, for any reason in its sole discretion and without liability (i) modify all or any portion of the Service, and (ii) suspend, discontinue and/or restrict the use of all or any portion of the Service; provided, that no such notice will be required if the change does not materially degrade the functionality of the Service.

    The Service is hosted on servers located in the United States. These Terms of Service, and all matters arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service, shall be governed by the federal laws of the United States and the laws of the State of Missouri, without giving effect to the conflict of law provisions thereof and excluding any application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. You consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal courts sitting in St. Louis, Missouri, unless no federal subject matter jurisdiction exists, in which case you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state courts sitting in St. Charles County, Missouri. You hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which you may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. You agree that any cause of action that you may desire to bring arising out of or related to these Terms of Service must commence within one (1) year after the occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to the cause of action; otherwise, such cause of action shall be permanently barred. You also agree that a breach by you of these Terms of Service will cause irreparable harm to MembershipWare for which money damages alone would not be an adequate remedy; and that MembershipWare shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have hereunder or at law, without a bond or other security or having to prove that monetary damages alone will not afford an adequate remedy.

   <li>
    The Terms of Service (including our Privacy Policy) constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the access and/or use of the Service and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings regarding such subject matter (none of which shall be binding). Nothing contained in any purchase order or similar document issued by you or Customer will in any way modify or add any additional terms or conditions to the Terms of Service. If any provision of these Terms of Service is declared or found to be illegal, unenforceable or void, then the invalid or unenforceable portion shall be modified in accordance with the applicable law as nearly as possible to reflect the original intention of the applicable provision, and the remaining sections of these Terms of Service shall remain in full force and effect. No right or remedy conferred by these Terms of Service is exclusive of any other right or remedy conferred herein or by law or in equity; rather, all of such rights and remedies are cumulative of every other such right or remedy and may be exercised concurrently or separately from time-to-time. MembershipWare may provide notice to you relating to these Terms of Service by sending the notice by e-mail or U.S. mail to your last known e-mail address or postal address, if any, by providing a notice to Administrators of the applicable Account they log in to the Service, or by posting a notice on the Service; and any such notice shall be deemed given to and received by Customer and each Authorized User on the earlier of the day it is sent or the day it is posted on the Service. A printed version of these Terms of Service and of any notices given to you in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms of Service to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. The failure of MembershipWare to insist upon or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of these Terms of Service shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. If MembershipWare brings any suit against you to enforce these Terms of Service or otherwise in connection with your use of the Service, you agree that if MembershipWare prevails in such suit MembershipWare shall be entitled to recover all costs and expenses incurred in such suit including reasonable attorneys' fees. Use of the Service is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms of Service. In these Terms of Service, "person" shall be broadly construed to include individuals and all forms of legal entities; and the word "including" (and its analogues "include" and "includes") will be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". These Terms of Service shall be construed without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against the party drafting an instrument. These Terms of Service create an independent contractor relationship between you and MembershipWare, and shall not be construed as creating any agency, partnership, joint venture or other form of joint enterprise, employment or fiduciary relationship between the parties.
