The City of White Oak is considered a "nonentitlement" city and therefore is qualified to apply for a grant from the Texas Department of Agriculture's Texas Capital Fund. This is an economic development tool designed to provide financial resources for public infrastructure or real estate needed to assist a business that commits to create and/or retain permanent jobs. The real estate and/or improvements must be owned by the community and leased to the business. The application process is available on a monthly and competitive basis. Only units of general local government are eligible applicants. Click

Chapter 380 of the Local Government Code authorizes municipalities to offer a limitless range of incentives designed to promote state or local economic development. Specifically, it allows for the provision of loans and grants of city funds, as well as the use of city staff, city facilities, or city services, at minimal or no charge, to promote local industrial, commercial, and retail business development. A city may condition the incentive upon the creation of employment, construction of improvements, continued operations in a city for a stated period, or other public consideration.

A municipality and a business prospect may tailor an economic development incentive agreement to address their unique needs. The agreement can be structured to promote a broad range of economic development programs, as long as:

* The program serves a public purpose
  + The state legislature amended Article III, §52-a of the Texas Constitution in 2005 to allow for the creation of programs and making of loans and grants of public money for the public purposes of :
* The projects are funded by current revenue or authorized debt
  + Funds used should include the amount in the city budget or funded through authorized proceeds. Bonds may be issued only if first authorized by voters in an election held on the issue.
* The municipality complies with its Charter and applicable statutes
  + The City of White Oak is a home rule city governed by state statutes and its home rule charter. A particular action may not be prohibited by a state statute, but its charter may dictate otherwise.

* Use or loan of city personnel, equipment, and facilities for economic development projects.
* Lease of city owned land or buildings to business.

The Texas Leverage Fund (TLF) allows economic development corporations to leverage future sales tax revenues to support job retention or creation. TLF loans provide flexible financing terms to match the unique needs of communities, with maturities of up to 15 years available. TLF loans are low-cost and EDCs are eligible to borrow four to five times their annual sales tax revenues.

Loan proceeds must be used to pay eligible costs of projects as defined by the Economic Development Act of 1979. Examples of eligible costs include land, buildings, machinery, equipment for manufacturing and industrial operations, sports, athletic, entertainment, and public park purposes and events.
