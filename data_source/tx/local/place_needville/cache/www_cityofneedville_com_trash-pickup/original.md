Below are helpful trash pickup tips to follow.

* Trash Pickup Dates & Times
  --------------------------

  **Regular Trash**
  is picked up every Wednesday.

    

  **Heavy Trash**
  is picked up every other Wednesday.

    

  Please have your trash/poly cart out **BEFORE**
  7:00 AM to ensure service.

* Report Missed Trash
  -------------------

  If your trash is **NOT**
  picked up, please call GFL as soon as possible to report the issue at **[(281) 368-8397](tel:(281) 368-8397)**
* How to Fill Your Poly Carts
  ---------------------------

  **Do not** overfill your poly cart. The lids should close completely. Overfilled poly carts can cause spillage during the collection process and litter your property and neighborhood streets. Overfilled poly carts will not be serviced.

    

  **Do not**put garbage bags on top of the cart. Your cart should be loose enough to come out when tipped during servicing. Tightly compacted bags or trash inside the cart may not come out when serviced. Republic Services is not responsible for garbage that spills during the collection process.

    

  All trash must be in the poly cart. Trash bags outside of the poly carts will not be collected due to the automation service.
* Where to Place Your Poly Cart
  -----------------------------

  **All poly carts** must be placed within 3 feet of the street for curbside collection.

    

  Please make sure your poly cart is not blocked by vehicles. The collection arm on the automated truck requires space to make the collection safely.

    

  Please keep the containers away from obstacles that may interfere with the collection.

    

  Placement of your poly cart in the correct position is critical to servicing your residence as this collection is done by automation.
