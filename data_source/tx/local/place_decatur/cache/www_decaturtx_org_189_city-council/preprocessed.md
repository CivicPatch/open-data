As Mayor and a representative of our great city, I would like to welcome you to Decatur, Texas. We are a vibrant community offering excellent employment and civic opportunities. We offer unique and established businesses in which to shop and dine. Come visit us and find out why Decatur is Greater!

Our city is located at the crossroads of two U.S. highways, 81/287 and 380, nestled just outside of the Dallas- Fort Worth Metroplex.  Decatur is home to a bustling downtown area filled with businesses, restaurants, boutiques and shops. With a rich history, Decatur was founded in 1858 as the county seat of Wise County and was a well-known stopping site for ranchers and herders coming in from the Chisholm Trail.

Our city is home to one of the best historic courthouses in the country. Decatur has always been a well-rounded, thriving town with a strong sense of community, where families desire to locate, live, work, raise children and pursue their dreams. Our annual calendar of events is loaded with many opportunities for individuals and families to participate and be active in our great community.
We have an outstanding public education system with a large 4A high school, excellent private schools and a local college campus, Weatherford College. Decatur has many active churches, charitable organizations, 6 public parks, a large library, conference center, and a municipal airport. Decatur also hosts the annual Wise County Youth Fair, the oldest continuously operating event of its kind in the state. The Wise County Old Settlers Reunion is also one of the oldest traditions, with attractions for all ages, including carnival rides, live music, and food, making the multi-generational event a must to attend.
Decatur offers leading healthcare services and is home to Medical City, Decatur, the largest employer in Wise County with more than 400 members on medical staff and 700 employees. the dedicated staff, physicians, and volunteers of Medical City Decatur have demonstrated outstanding commitment to improving health outcomes, fostering innovation, and ensuring quality care is accessible to all by obtaining certifications as centers of excellence in the areas of stroke, chest pain, and bariatrics.
Decatur, with its blend of history and continued business opportunities, our city offers a uniquely positive climate to support its citizens. Decatur truly is a great place to live, work, and raise a family!
Sincerely,

Mike McQuiston,

Mayor of Decatur
