Slaton is a city located in Lubbock County, Texas, United States. Founded by German immigrants, Slaton holds the distinction of being the westernmost German settlement in Texas. The city was officially named for Lubbock rancher and banker O. L. Slaton, Sr. (1867–1946), who played a key role in promoting railroad construction in the area—an effort that helped drive the city’s early growth and development.

With a population of 5,858 as recorded in the 2020 census, Slaton is a close‑knit community with deep historical roots. Today, the city honors its heritage while continuing to grow and serve residents and visitors with pride, resilience, and a strong sense of community.

Slaton is a small West Texas agricultural community established in 1911 by the Santa Fe Railroad. Today, BNSF Railway continues to use the Slaton rail yard as a switching station, reflecting the city’s longstanding connection to the railroad industry.

Slaton operates as a home rule city with a population of approximately 6,129 citizens. It is conveniently located about 15 miles southeast of Lubbock, Texas, along U.S. Highway 84, providing easy access to regional amenities while maintaining a strong small‑town atmosphere.
