The City government shall be a "Council-Manager Government." Pursuant to the provisions of and subject only to the limitations imposed by this Charter and by the state constitution and statutes, the City Council shall be vested with all the powers of the City.

Beginning with the November 2015 election, the City Council shall be composed of a Mayor and six (6) Council Members elected under a geographic ward and an at-large place system. The Mayor and each Council Member shall be elected at large and, unless sooner removed under the provisions of this Charter, shall serve a term of two (2) years and until their successor has been elected and duly qualified. All of the City Council holding office at the time of passage of any amendments to this Charter shall continue to hold their respective office until the respective term for which they were elected expires.

The City shall be divided into three (3) geographic wards, consisting of Wards I, II, and III, and three (3) places, consisting of Places 1, 2, and 3. Wards I and III, and Place 2 shall be elected in odd-numbered years, and Ward II, Places 1 and 3, and the Mayor shall be elected in even-numbered years. The three (3) City Council wards shall be defined by ordinance, and the boundaries thereof shall be subject to periodic review by the City Council to ensure equal voting rights for all citizens under state and federal law. City Council ward boundaries shall be redefined by ordinance to compensate for any significant change in population within a given ward. Each Council Member representing a City Council ward must, at the time of his or her election and during the term of office, reside in the ward which he or she represents. Each Council Member representing a City Council place must reside in the City at the time of his or her election and during the term of office reside in the City, and may reside in any part of the City.
