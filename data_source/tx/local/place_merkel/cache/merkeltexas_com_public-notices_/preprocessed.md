**[Notice About 2022 Tax Rates – Form 50-212](https://merkeltexas.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DOC072822-07282022175639.pdf)**

AUSTIN – With severe weather ripping through multiple regions of Texas, the Texas Division of Emergency Management (TDEM) encourages citizens to report damage to property by submitting a damage assessment survey. Today’s severe storms have already produced large hail, damaging winds and dangerous tornadoes.

“By providing details through the iSTAT damage survey, Texans can notify emergency management officials about the extent of damage sustained during this severe weather event,” said Texas Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd. “Texans are encouraged to assist the damage assessment process by uploading photos and including important details about any losses.”

The iSTAT damage survey can be filled out in English and Spanish online by visiting
[**damage.tdem.texas.gov**](https://damage.tdem.texas.gov/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery)
and clicking on
*March Severe Weather*
.

TDEM has published a tutorial video explaining the iSTAT surveys
[**here on the survey landing page**](https://damage.tdem.texas.gov/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery)
.

In addition to activating resources for severe weather, the state of Texas, through TDEM, has deployed assets in support of wildfires around the state. Wildfire resources for Texans, including the iSTAT survey, can be accessed on the
[**TDEM website at tdem.texas.gov**](https://www.tdem.texas.gov/disasters/2022-march-wildfires?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery)
