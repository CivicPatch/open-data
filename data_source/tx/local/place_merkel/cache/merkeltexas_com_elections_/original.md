**How do I register?**

You can fill out a registration application [online](https://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/voter/reqvr.shtml), but an original application with signature must still be mailed to your local county voter registrar.

You can also call the statewide Voter Registration Office at 210-335-VOTE (8683) and request a voter registration application. You may also find voter registration applications at libraries, government offices, high schools, or with volunteer voter registration deputies.

If you moved to a different county, yes. If you moved to a different address within the same county, no, but you should update your address [online](https://txapps.texas.gov/tolapp/sos/SOSACManager?lang=eng&XXtask=99). You can also [get a new voter registration application](https://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/voter/reqvr.shtml), make note of your new address, and mail it to the Voter Registration Office.
