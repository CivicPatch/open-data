### Irene rojas District 4 Representative

Proudly Rooted in Socorro, Texas
  
  
I was raised in the heart of Socorro, Texas, where I attended Socorro ISD schools from kindergarten through high school. I’m a proud graduate of Socorro High School, Class of 1988.
  
  
A Career in Education
  
  
In 2003, I earned a bachelor’s degree in education, and in 2009, a master’s degree in leadership from the University of Texas at El Paso. I have proudly dedicated over 22 years to serving our community as an educator and currently serve as an Assistant Principal in Socorro ISD.
  
  
Family, Legacy, and Resilience
  
  
My roots in Socorro run deep. My father—a respected rock wall builder and concrete contractor—helped shape the foundation of many homes in our community. The rock walls he built still stand today, and his legacy continues to guide and inspire me.
  
  
I am one of eight siblings. After living in San Antonio for nearly two years, I returned home to be closer to my mother and family following the passing of my father.
  
  
I was married for 20 years and raised three wonderful children. After becoming a single mother, my oldest joined the military, and I continued raising my two youngest. I built a new home for us here in Socorro, where my roots remain strong. Despite life’s challenges, I raised my children with love, perseverance, and a deep commitment to our community’s values. Today, they are all successful, independent adults.
  
  
Serving Socorro with Pride
  
  
As your District 4 City Council Member, I proudly advocate for the people of Socorro. My focus is on:
  
  
 \* Rebuilding our infrastructure
  
  
 \* Improving public safety
  
  
 \* Creating opportunities for future generations
  
  
 I serve with integrity and humility—always listening, always learning, and always working to make Socorro a better place for all.  
  
 I strive to leave a lasting, positive legacy, just as my father did, for current and future generations.
