City Council
------------

* City Council


The 1981 City Charter established the City of Hillsboro as a home-rule city with a council-manager form of government. The Hillsboro City Council is empowered to enact local legislation, adopt budgets, determine policies, and appoint the City Manager, who in turn shall be responsible to the City Council for the execution of the laws and the administration of the government of the city.
The Hillsboro City Council is composed of the Mayor and six (6) members of the Council. The Mayor and Council Members serve two (2) year terms. Council seats 2, 4, and 6 are up for election in even-numbered years and the Mayor and Council seats 1, 3, and 5 are up for election in odd-numbered years.
The Mayor serves as the presiding officer of the Council. Although the Mayor is considered as part of the composition of the Council, the Mayor shall only vote in the event of a tie by the Council. When authorized by the Council, the Mayor shall sign all official documents such as ordinances, resolutions, conveyances, grant agreements, official plats, contracts, and bonds.
