Mayor
=====

###### Chet Clark, City of Seminole Mayor

Seminole has always been home. Growing up here, I saw firsthand the potential of this great town, and for the past 17 years I have had the honor of serving, as a council member and currently as your mayor, working to make that potential a reality.

My vision is simple: to leave Seminole in a better place than I found it. That means focusing on the essentials – a reliable water supply, a strong infrastructure, and responsible growth that benefits all residents.

As your mayor, I’m committed to open communication, transparency, and fiscal responsibility. Seminole’s future is bright, and I’m honored to be a part of it. Let’s continue working together to build a stronger, more vibrant Seminole for everyone.
