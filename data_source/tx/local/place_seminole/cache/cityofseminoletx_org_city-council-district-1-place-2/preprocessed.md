================================

**Lloyd Glass, District 1, Place 2**

I am proud to have served on the Seminole City Council for the past nine years. I have been married to my wife, Lilley, for 49 years, and together we’ve raised two wonderful children who’ve blessed us with seven grandchildren.

Seeing our community thrive is what motivates me. That’s why I decided to run for City Council – I felt I could contribute something positive. My goal remains the same: to continue making Seminole a great place to live, work, and raise a family.
