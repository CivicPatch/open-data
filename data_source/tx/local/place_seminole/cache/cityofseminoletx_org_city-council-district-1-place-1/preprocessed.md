Rey Saldana, Mayor Pro Tem, District 1, Place 1

I was born and raised here. I’ve seen the heart and spirit of this community firsthand. That’s why, for the past 27 years, I’ve had the honor of serving on the City Council – a chance to give back to the town that has given me so much.

As your Mayor Pro Tem, I’m dedicated to ensuring Seminole continues to be a place where families thrive. My focus is on the issues that matter most to our residents – a reliable and secure water supply, a well-maintained drainage system, and efficient traffic flow. These are essential elements for a healthy and functional community, and I’m committed to finding solutions that address each one.

Through open communication and collaboration with my fellow council members, city staff, and the public, I believe we can tackle these challenges and build an even stronger Seminole. Your input is valuable, and I encourage you to stay engaged in the process.
