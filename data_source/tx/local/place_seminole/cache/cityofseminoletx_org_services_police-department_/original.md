**Seminole Police Department – SafeCam Program**
------------------------------------------------

**Protect yourself, your family, and your community by registering with SafeCam.**

The **Seminole Police Department SafeCam Program** is a voluntary crime-prevention and investigative initiative designed to strengthen public safety through collaboration between the Seminole Police Department and the community we serve.

### **What is SafeCam?**

SafeCam allows residents and business owners to voluntarily register their security cameras with the Seminole Police Department. Security camera footage is an invaluable investigative tool that can help establish leads, identify suspects, and solve crimes more quickly.

Similar SafeCam programs are used by law enforcement agencies across the country and have proven effective in deterring criminal activity and improving neighborhood safety.

### **How SafeCam Works**

* By registering your camera, officers will know how to contact you **if a crime occurs near your property**.
* Registration **does NOT** give the Seminole Police Department access to your camera system or live footage.
* The Department **cannot view or retrieve your footage without your consent**.
* If investigators believe your camera may have captured relevant evidence, you may be contacted and asked to **voluntarily share footage** related to a specific incident.

### **Privacy & Confidentiality**

* All SafeCam information is **kept confidential**.
* Your participation is **completely voluntary**.
* Your contact information is used **only for investigative or crime-prevention purposes**.
* There is **no cost** to register.

### **Who Can Register?**

* Homeowners
* Renters
* Business owners
* Anyone who currently has security cameras or plans to install them

Registration takes only a few minutes and requires basic information about the location and type of cameras on your property.

### **After You Register**

Once your registration is submitted, a member of the Seminole Police Department may follow up to confirm your participation. You may **opt out at any time** by submitting an opt-out request.

---

**SafeCam is about partnership, prevention, and protecting Seminole—together.**  
Register today and help make our community safer.

The **Seminole Police Department** is proud to announce a partnership with **Odessa Crime Stoppers**, strengthening our commitment to public safety through community collaboration. Odessa Crime Stoppers is a long-standing nonprofit organization that works alongside law enforcement agencies to solve crimes by encouraging citizens to submit anonymous tips regarding criminal activity, wanted persons, or unsolved cases. Through this partnership, Seminole residents now have an additional, secure way to share information while remaining completely anonymous.

Citizens may submit tips by calling **333-TIPS (8477)**, using the **333tips.org** website, or through the Crime Stoppers mobile app. Tipsters are never required to provide their name and may be eligible for a cash reward if their information leads to an arrest or indictment. This partnership enhances investigative capabilities, promotes community involvement, and provides a safe and confidential method for the public to help keep Seminole and the surrounding region safe
