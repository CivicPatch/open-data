**About Neighbors**
===================

Neighbors is a free app created for residents to connect and share hyper-local community updates and information from reliable sources. Neighbors Verified allows local government, public safety organizations and community organizations to join Neighbors to help keep residents updated through a custom interface of their jurisdiction.

Millions of residents in communities across the U.S. have joined Neighbors and use it to receive real-time, hyper-local community updates from fellow users and the local government, public safety agencies, and community organizations that serve them.

Share updates with your community by creating a new post or commenting on existing posts in your local Neighbors feed.

In some neighborhoods, local organizations use Neighbors to connect with residents and share hyper-local updates in the communities they serve. Visit Ring’s
[Active Organization Map](https://ring.com/support/verified-help/articles/ac9ox/Active-Organization-Map)
to see if your local government or public safety agency is on Neighbors.
