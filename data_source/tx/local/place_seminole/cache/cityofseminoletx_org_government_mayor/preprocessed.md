###### Chet Clark, City of Seminole Mayor

Seminole has always been home. Growing up here, I saw firsthand the potential of this great town, and for the past 17 years I have had the honor of serving, as a council member and currently as your mayor, working to make that potential a reality.

As your mayor, I’m committed to open communication, transparency, and fiscal responsibility. Seminole’s future is bright, and I’m honored to be a part of it. Let’s continue working together to build a stronger, more vibrant Seminole for everyone.
