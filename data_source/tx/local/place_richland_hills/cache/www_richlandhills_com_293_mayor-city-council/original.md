Purpose
-------

The Richland Hills City Council serves as the governing and lawmaking body of the City of Richland Hills. There are seven members: a Mayor and six Council Members. The Mayor and members of the City Council shall be elected for terms of three (3) years and shall hold office until their respective successors have been elected and qualified. Two (2) members shall be elected at the regular election held annually on the first Saturday in May, except every third year where the Mayor and two councilmembers shall be elected, unless the Council designates an alternative date allowed by State law at least six (6) months prior to the regular election. In order to affect a transition to three (3) year terms upon the adoption of the Charter, elections shall be held as follows:

1. The Mayor and Place 2 and Place 4 shall fulfill their two-year terms and be elected to three (3) year terms upon expiration of the current term in 2024.
2. Place 1 shall be elected to three (3) year terms upon the expiration of the current two-year term in 2025.
3. The current terms of Place 3 and Place 5 shall be extended one (1) year to expire in 2026, at which time Place 3 and Place 5 shall be elected to a three (3) year term.
4. Place 6 shall be elected or appointed to serve for a two-year term to expire in 2025, at which time Place 6 shall be elected to a three (3) year term.

The Mayor Pro Tem is selected by the Council Members each year at the first regular meeting following the general City election. In the absence or disability of the Mayor, the Mayor Pro Tem performs all the Mayor's duties.

Powers
------

"All powers and authority which are expressly or explicitly conferred on or possessed by the City shall be vested in and exercised by the City Council, provided however, that the Council shall have no power to exercise those powers which are expressly conferred upon other City officers by this Charter."
