Councilmember Place 6
=====================

Councilmember Roland Goveas
---------------------------

Roland's journey took an exciting turn when he made the decision to relocate to Texas in 1992. In 1995, he started Synetics Computers Inc., (a Managed
services company) and in 1998 he settled in Richland Hills, a vibrant city that would become his home and the center of his endeavors.

In addition to his professional achievements, Roland has made significant contributions to his community. From 2011 to 2017 and again from 2018 to 2020, he served as a council member, actively participating in the governance and decision-making processes that shape the City of Richland Hills. Roland's dedication to community development was further exemplified through his involvement with various boards and his role as the chair of the City's inaugural 4
of July Hometown Parade. He has also served on the Charter Review Committee twice, demonstrating his commitment to ensuring effective governance and transparency.
