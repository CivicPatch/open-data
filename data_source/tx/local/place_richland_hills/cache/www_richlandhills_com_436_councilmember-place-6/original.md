Councilmember Place 6
=====================

Councilmember Roland Goveas
---------------------------

Roland's journey took an exciting turn when he made the decision to relocate to Texas in 1992. In 1995, he started Synetics Computers Inc., (a Managed IT services company) and in 1998 he settled in Richland Hills, a vibrant city that would become his home and the center of his endeavors.

Roland got his bachelor’s degree (B-COM) in India. Driven by his entrepreneurial spirit, Roland expanded his business interests beyond IT services to the real estate sector. He currently manages three thriving real estate companies.

In addition to his professional achievements, Roland has made significant contributions to his community. From 2011 to 2017 and again from 2018 to 2020, he served as a council member, actively participating in the governance and decision-making processes that shape the City of Richland Hills. Roland's dedication to community development was further exemplified through his involvement with various boards and his role as the chair of the City's inaugural 4th of July Hometown Parade. He has also served on the Charter Review Committee twice, demonstrating his commitment to ensuring effective governance and transparency.

Roland's interests and passions extend beyond the business and civic spheres. He has a deep love for travel, exploring both domestic destinations within the USA and venturing abroad to experience different cultures. Roland is an avid Pickleball player, finding joy and camaraderie in the sport. Additionally, he has a keen interest in space and rocket technology and staying up to date with the latest developments in this fascinating field.
