Mayor Curtis Bergthold
----------------------

Mayor Bergthold has been a resident of Tarrant County since 1973 and attended the University of Texas at Arlington. He and his wife, Carol, have four children/stepchildren, Chase, Jordan, Caitlin and Ashlyn, as well as two grandchildren. When he and his family were looking for a home, they were continually drawn to Richland Hills, and they couldn't be happier to be here.

Mayor Bergthold began his career working in the golf business, but he decided to pursue a new career as a Public Works Construction Inspector for the City of Fort Worth in 1980. In 1993, he began working as the Public Works Chief Construction Inspector for the City of Grapevine. During his last eight years at the City of Grapevine, Mayor Bergthold was also a Project Manager for public buildings. The value of all public works inspection projects managed by Mayor Bergthold was over $400 million, and the public building projects were valued at over $100 million.

He has worked with federal, state, and county agencies as well as other local cities, engineering and architecture firms, public utility companies, and countless contractors who still perform work in the Richland Hills community. Mayor Bergthold continues relationships with many of these individuals from his past as they are still able to help out Richland Hills in times of need. Over 40 years of public service has given Mayor Bergthold a unique opportunity to learn government processes, laws, administration, and, most importantly, how to build infrastructure and public buildings the right way so the citizens get exactly what they paid for.

Mayor Bergthold's vision for Richland Hills is you, and the needs for the Richland Hills community. Together, Mayor Bergthold and the community will work to continue the progress that has already been made and grow to make Richland Hills a better place for everyone.
