| Government |
| The City Council, elected by the community, serves as the official governing body. In 2008, voters approved a home rule charter, establishing a Council/Manager form of government.  This system combines the political leadership of elected council members with the managerial expertise of an appointed local government manager. The council holds all governing power and hires a professional manager to oversee public services. |

| Elections |
| City Council members are elected for three-year terms on a nonpartisan basis. The Council consists of a Mayor and six Council members, all elected by the entire city. After elections, Council members select the Mayor Pro Tem and Deputy Mayor Pro Tem from among themselves. For more information about current elections, please visit the [elections webpage](https://www.fatetx.gov/435/Elections) . |
