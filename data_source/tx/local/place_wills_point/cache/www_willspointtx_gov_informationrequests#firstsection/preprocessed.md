The Texas Public Information Act does not require a governmental body to create new information, to do legal research, or to answer questions. The requestor must ask for records or information already in existence. The governmental body has 10 business days within which to respond to the request. The governmental body may collect the fee prescribed by law or regulation for the requested documents. If a fee is not prescribed by law or regulation, the fee shall be the actual cost of duplicating the record.
