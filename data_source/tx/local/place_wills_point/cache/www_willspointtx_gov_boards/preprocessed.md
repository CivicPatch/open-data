The City of Wills Point has several volunteer boards and commissions.  These boards are a vital and necessary component of our City organization. Municipal law requires hearings and action from these groups to make decisions for the growth and development of our community.  If you are looking for an opportunity to serve your community please take time to complete our application or contact the City secretary to obtain more information.
