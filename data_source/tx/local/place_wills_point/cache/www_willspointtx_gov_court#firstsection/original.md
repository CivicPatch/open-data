Local Rules for the City of Wills Point Municipal Court:

**Appearance Instructions** – You must appear in person or represented by your attorney in the Wills Point Municipal Court no later than the date stated on your copy of the citation.   You can appear before your court date provided your case is filed with the court, which takes three to five business days from the issue date of the citation.  **Please note that telephone calls do not constitute an appearance.**

***You may dispose of your case prior to your court date by one of the following methods:***

If you wish to plead “Not Guilty”, **you must appear in person before the court date stated on your citation** to enter your plea.  If you wish to be represented by counsel, your attorney must file a written notice of legal representation with the Court before your court date.

**Not Guilty** – When you enter this plea, you are stating to the Court that you believe you are innocent of the charge and wish to have your case placed on the pre-trial docket prior to scheduling the case for trial.  You may request a trial by the Court, or a jury trial.  Your case will be set for a pre-trial hearing and you will meet with the prosecuting attorney at that hearing.  If you are found guilty at the trial of your case, the Judge or jury will exercise its discretion in determining the amount of the fine, court costs and any additional costs and fees authorized by State law that will be assessed against you.  If you are found not guilty at the trial, you will not be required to pay any fine or court costs. If you believe you are not guilty, you should enter that plea and set your case for trial.

If you wish to plead guilty or “no contest” and pay any fines and costs incurred, you must appear in person at our offices on or before the appearance date listed on your citation,  or if appearing by mail your correspondence must be postmarked on or before the appearance date listed on your citation to avoid an additional offense of Violation of Promise to Appear, which will cause you to incur additional fines and court costs.  If you wish to be represented by counsel, your attorney must file a written notice of legal representation with the Court on or before your court date.

**Guilty** – Entering this plea means that you are admitting to the offense as charged.  You will be required to pay the applicable fine, plus all court costs.

**Nolo Contendre (or No Contest)**  – This plea means that you are “not contesting” the offense.  You are not admitting that you committed the offense nor are you denying it either.  However, you understand that you will still be responsible for paying the applicable fine plus all court costs.  A “no contest” plea may not be used at a subsequent civil trial as evidence of guilt.

**Driving Safety Course** – If you enter a plea of guilty or no contest and you are under the age of 25, you are required to take a Driving Safety Course and must:  (1) enter your plea of nolo contendere or guilty, either in person or by certified mail on or before the court appearance date listed on the citation; (3) provide proof of financial responsibility; and (3) pay court costs in the amount of $134.00; or $169.00 if the offense was committed in a school zone, at the time that you are ordered to take the Driving Safety Course.

To be eligible for the Driving Safety Course, you must meet the following requirements:

1. If speeding violation, must not exceed 25 miles over the speed limit;
2. Must not have taken the course in the past 12 months;
3. Must have a valid Texas driver’s license or permit or proof of active military duty;
4. Must not have or held a Commercial Driver’s License (CDL); and
5. Must not have committed violation in a work zone with workers present.

**Deferred Disposition** – If you wish to be placed on deferred disposition you must meet the following requirements:  (1) enter a plea of guilty or nolo contendere either in person or by mail on or before the court appearance date listed on your citation, and request Deferred Disposition; and (2) pay at least the amount of the court costs at the beginning of the deferral period.

If the Judge grants your request for deferred disposition, you will be placed on a 30 day deferral period, during which you cannot be convicted of the same offense for which you have been placed on deferred disposition.  You will be required to sign an Affidavit of No Other Violations in front of a Notary Public, the Court Clerk or Judge and file same with the Court, at the end of the deferral period, and the fine and court costs will have to have been paid in full by the end of the deferral period.  If you do not file an Affidavit of No Other Violations with the Court at the end of the deferral period, then you will not have complied with the terms of the deferred disposition and you will receive a conviction on your record, rather than a compliance dismissal.

**A SELF-ADDRESSED, STAMPED ENVELOPE MUST ACCOMPANY ALL CORRESPONDENCE BY MAIL IN ORDER FOR DOCUMENTATION TO BE RETURNED TO YOU BY MAIL.**

**If you are a JUVENILE or a MINOR charged with a Tobacco or Alcohol related offense, DO NOT MAIL PAYMENT.  YOU MUST APPEAR IN PERSON AT A JUVENILE HEARING OR MINOR IN POSSESSION HEARING.**

**Juveniles (ages 10-16) MUST APPEAR IN COURT WITH A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN.  Notification of the hearing date and time will be mailed to the defendant’s address listed on the citation**.

**Alcohol or Tobacco by a Minor Offenses (Ages 17-20) MUST APPEAR IN COURT.  You must contact the Court on or before the date shown on your citation, to schedule a hearing before the Court, and notification of the hearing date and time will be mailed to the defendant’s address listed on the citation.**

If a Defendant’s Motion for Continuance is denied, in order for the Defendant to avoid a warrant, a bond in the amount set by the court may be required to be posted, at the discretion of the Judge.  It is the responsibility of the Defendant to determine whether the Motion was granted or denied and to determine whether a bond is required.  If a State’s Motion for Continuance is denied, the case will proceed to trial, plea or other disposition.

**Pre-trial Motions** – Pre-trial motions shall be filed in writing with the Court and a copy of same shall be forwarded by the Defendant and/or Defendant’s counsel to the prosecuting attorney.  All motions must be relevant and specific as to the case involved.  A hearing on any Motions filed with the Court may be required by the Judge of the Court, and any requests for a hearing must be approved by the Judge of the Court.  Failure to file pretrial Motions as indicated herein shall constitute a waiver of having those issues heard before trial.  Unless leave of court has been granted, all pretrial Motions shall be filed at least 14 days prior to the trial date, and responses thereto, if any, shall be filed at least 7 days prior to the trial date.  If a pretrial Motion has not been ruled upon before the trial date, such Motion shall be heard on the date of trial.  Service of a Motion or Response may be made as provided by law.  Each Motion or Response shall contain a certificate of service signed by the Movant indicating that a copy of such Motion or Response has been served upon the opposing party; the manner of service; and the date of service.

**Case settings** –  a Defendant and/or its counsel may request that the case be set for a trial by jury or a trial before the Court.
