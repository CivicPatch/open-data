EAST BERNARD, TEXAS. East Bernard is on the west side of the San Bernard River at the intersection of State Highway 60 and U.S. Highway 90A, fifteen miles north of Wharton in northeast Wharton County. The community was originally on the east side of the river, where Jethro Spivi built the first residence around 1850; hence the name East Bernard. Settlement was slow until 1859 and the arrival of the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado Railway. A bridge was built, and the depot, Bernard Station, though originally located on the east bank of the river, was moved by 1869 to the west side, to the site of East Bernard's future Main Street.

1. At the July council meeting, it was decided that Clubside Drive will undergo a full reconstruction rather than just pothole repairs. We are currently in the process of collecting bids for the project and anticipate work beginning in the coming months.

2. The City is currently identifying underground utilities at Brandes and Otto. Once that is complete, we will explore options to repair the sinkhole.

3. The City is prioritizing efforts to address neglected and deteriorating residential and commercial properties.
