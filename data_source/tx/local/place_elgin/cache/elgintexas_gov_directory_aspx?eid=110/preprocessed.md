: "I am a multi-generational Elginite who was elected to be the Ward 2 City Council Representative. I have worked in the healthcare field for over 11 years with 5 years prior to that I worked in Security. I love most things outdoors like bike riding, hiking, swimming, or playing tennis with my two boys and husband. I am a part of multiple organizations for volunteering here in Elgin such as the Juneteenth Committee,  Elgin Cares, and am the Chairperson of the Hog Eye Children's Parade to name a few. I believe in community and aim to help the possibilities that will benefit the community in positive ways".
