Theresa Yvonne McShan is the daughter of S.H. and Mattie McShan and a lifelong resident of Elgin, Texas. Theresa had an exciting start, being the firstborn in Elgin on New Year’s Day in 1960. Theresa has two children and six grandchildren to whom she is totally devoted. She is known as “Nana” to her grandchildren and “Memaw” to many Godchildren. She is that neighborhood mom. She loves to cook, and everyone loves to eat at her house, and she never runs out.

Theresa is a member of the Mt. Pleasant Missionary Baptist Church in Elgin, TX, where she serves as the church musician and choir director, Sunday School teacher, and Youth Director.  Theresa has been a church musician for over 50 years and loves to sing gospel and dabs in a little R&B. She will tell you that she has a strong faith in Christ and that faith can and will sustain you through life.   Theresa has a distinct passion for helping others in need.  She has opened her home many times to those in her circle who needed a place to stay.   She gives freely not only to her church, but to non-profit organizations who are affiliated with Cancer, Diabetes, Food Banks, and United Way.  She also cooks for the Friday meals at Mt. Moriah Baptist Church in Elgin, TX.

Theresa is a leader and lifelong learner with a servant's heart. Her academic journey is a testament to her dedication and intelligence. She held numerous leadership positions in high school, including the first African American Twirler and Drum Major of the Elgin High School Band. She graduated in the top 10 of her class and continued her education to receive a Medical Assistant certification, an associate degree in Applied Science - Respiratory Therapist, a Bachelor of Science in Management with a minor in Human Resources, and a master’s degree in health education, all with honors.

Theresa believes in being involved in her community.   She served nine years on the Elgin City Council and is currently President of the Elgin Main Street Board.   Over the years she has served on Envision Elgin and EISD Advisory Council.  Theresa was awarded Most Worthy Citizen in 2004 by the Elgin Chamber of Commerce.  She has volunteered for over 20 years on the annual Hogeye Festival committee which she received the honor of being crowned Queen in 2013.  Theresa was also awarded The Esther Award in 2014 for her work in the African American church community.  In 2023, Theresa was inducted into the Hogeye Hall of Fame for her years of service on the Hogeye Festival Committee.

Theresa has retired from the State of Texas after 35 years.  During her tenure with the Health of Human Services Commission (HHSC), she had many leadership roles. She was a charter member of the HHSC Leadership Academy.  As a Program Supervisor, Theresa has served as a mentor for over 200 interns in the agency internship, and the agency was recognized for her work by Senator Royce West, who sponsored Dr. Emmett Conrad's Leadership Program.  She has directly created over 40 designated lactation rooms across the State of Texas and serves as the agency wellness coordinator for over 35,000 employees.  She is vested in ensuring that the implementation of policies, events, and strategic plans is focused on improving employee health.  HHSC received recognition for being one of the healthiest workplaces from the Mayor’s Health and Fitness Council in Austin, Texas.  Theresa has served as the agency ambassador for the State Employee Charitable Campaign (SECC) since 2010.  She received the Barbara Jordan Award in 2017 for the implementation of the current online giving system and for the increase in employee giving.  Theresa served as the Chair of the Capital Area Local Employee Committee for SECC for four years.   Over the past years, Theresa has provided giving opportunities to employees through partnering with non-profit organizations on events such as Coats for Kids, Annual Food Bank Drives, and Christmas Wish Lists for Foster Children.

Theresa began attending the Executive Women in Texas Government Conference in 2006 and has served as a member of the registration committee and later as chair of the registration, exhibits, and evaluation committees, as well as a moderator when needed. She also served as President elect in 2023 and is now serving as president from 2023 to 2024. She was named Woman of the Year 2024.

Theresa was elected the first African American mayor of Elgin, Texas May 2022.  This was especially exciting as Elgin was celebrating their 150 years of existence.
