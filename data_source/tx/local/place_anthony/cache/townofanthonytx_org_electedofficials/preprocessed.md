PO Box 1269, Anthony TX, 79821

Anthony is located about 22 miles northwest outside of downtown El Paso, TX and 25 miles South from downtown Las Cruces, NM. It’s right in between both major cities and offers visitors that home away from home, small town country, weekend getaway feeling.
Anthony offers the best of both worlds. Let’s face it, big city living isn’t for everyone, and there are good reasons for that.  All that hustle and bustle can be nice, but it can be stressful for some who wants a more low-key lifestyle. Anthony offers a strong sense of community, peace, relaxation, culture, and of course, safety, but it is still within close proximity to larger urban areas.
Anthony is part of the Rio Grande Valley, which has a rich history in agriculture, producing such crops as cotton, alfalfa, pecans, onions, lettuce, and wine grapes.  It is a great access point to drivve through and connect to the Historic Don Onate Trail, that leads through New Mexico.
Anthony is bordered to the west by the Rio Grande River and the east by the Franklin Mountain State Park.  Of course, this leads to beautiful scenery and opportunities for numerous outdoor activities. If you like hiking, biking, running, really anything outdoors.  Anthony is the place for you.
With the recent new Zoning and our new Master Plan, Anthony is moving forward with a dedicated plan for a more active and pedestrian friendly community, with our Smart-Growth approach which will support our community, and at the same time help protect our environment. Anthony is on the cusp of many revitalization projects that will enhance our town and make it THE place to be
Whether it be “Movies in the Park,” a hike through the western trails of the Franklin Mountain State Park, a bike ride through the Rio Grande Valley, or just listening to the silence only the desert at night can provide, we hope you enjoy our little piece of heaven here in our corner of Texas!
