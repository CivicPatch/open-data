![](https://cedarhilltx.com/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=45346)Originally from New York City, Gregory Glover emerged as a beacon of change on the path of community service and leadership. In June 2019, he was elected as to Place 5 on the City Council of the beautiful city of Cedar Hill Texas, igniting a journey marked by unwavering commitment and dedication to the city he proudly calls home.

Gregory's roots in community engagement run deep.

A servant leader in the truest sense, his mission is clear: to serve everyone equitably, ensuring no voice goes unheard. His relentless pursuit of this mission underpins his role as a Council Member, where he oversees budget intricacies, provides legislative leadership, advocates tirelessly for the community, and enacts visionary plans for Cedar Hill's future.

Gregory's journey is steeped in rich experiences. With over 25 years of service in Fortune 500 and nonprofit companies, he boasts a stellar track record in Sales, Marketing, and Leadership. Armed with a Bachelor of Business Administration in Advertising and Public Relations from City University of New York (Baruch College) and a Master of Science in Management and Leadership from Western Governors University in Texas, his expertise is unparalleled.

His commitment to fostering inclusive workplaces is not just a job; it's a vocation. His ability to engage with key stakeholders, build strategic partnerships, and provide consultancy services underscores his dedication to driving positive change.

At home, Gregory and his lovely wife, Nedin, celebrate the joys of parenthood with their five children and three cherished grandchildren.

Gregory Glover stands as a testament to the power of service, the embodiment of leadership, and the epitome of a community champion. His legacy is not just in the policies he shapes or the strategies he implements; it's in the lives he touches and the hearts he inspires. In Cedar Hill, Gregory isn't just a Council Member; he's a driving force behind a city's transformation, an advocate for every citizen, and a symbol of what passionate, dedicated leadership can achieve.
