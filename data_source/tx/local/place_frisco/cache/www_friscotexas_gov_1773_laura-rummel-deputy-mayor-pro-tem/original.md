Laura Rummel, Deputy Mayor Pro Tem
==================================

**City Council Place 5, Elected:** 2022  
**Current Term Expires:**2026  
**Occupation:**Vice President, Financial Products at Jackson Hewitt Tax Services   
**Family:**Married to Hayden, two dogs

Councilwoman Laura Rummel was elected during a special election in early 2022, re-elected in 2023.  Since joining the Council, she has helped to pass three increases in the homestead tax exemption from 10% to the state maximum of 20% and implemented the Senior Tax Freeze, has voted to approve zoning changes that reduced outstanding apartment rights by thousands, and played an instrumental role in securing state funding for Grand Park as Chair of Frisco’s Legislative Committee. She has also spearheaded numerous initiatives focused on pets including the launch of the Animal Advisory Committee.

Prior to Council, she previously served on Frisco’s Social Services and Housing Board, is a graduate of Leadership Frisco Class XXV, and is active in Frisco Women’s League and the Preston Ridge Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. She is also one of the founders of Frisco Pet Partners, a nonprofit dedicated to supporting the City of Frisco, its citizens, and its pets with efforts focused on providing animal education, supporting low-cost veterinarian options, preventing cruelty to animals, and reducing the homeless pet population.

Councilwoman Rummel graduated from Texas Tech University with a degree in Marketing and later earned her Executive Master’s in Business Administration from Southern Methodist University. Her 20+ year career has been spent in consumer products, payments, and financial technology. She has previously worked for multiple Fortune 500 companies including American Express and PayPal as well as smaller organizations like Crossmark and PayNearMe. She currently works with Jackson Hewitt Tax Services leading the product organization over financial products and attached services.

Laura was born in Lubbock, TX but grew up living all over (even spent 3 years in Bangkok, Thailand) as her father served 22 years in the United States Air Force as a fighter pilot. She first moved to Frisco in 2002, and she was joined by her husband, Hayden, after they married in 2008. You can often find them walking their rescue dogs in one of the many parks and trails in Frisco.
