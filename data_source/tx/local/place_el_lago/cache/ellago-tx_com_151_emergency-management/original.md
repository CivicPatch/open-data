* **Storm Surge:**A large dome of water up to 100 miles wide that sweeps across the coastline near where a hurricane makes landfall.
* **Storm Tide:** The actual level of sea water resulting from the astronomic tide combined with the storm surge.
* **Tropical Depression:** A tropical cyclonic (counter-clockwise) circulation with sustained surface wind speed up to 38 miles per hour (mph).
* **Tropical Disturbance:** A disturbed area of thunderstorms, tropical in origin, which is evident for 24 hours or more.
* **Tropical Storm:** A tropical cyclonic circulation with sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph.
