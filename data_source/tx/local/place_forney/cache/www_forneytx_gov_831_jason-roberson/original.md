Forney City Council, Mayor
--------------------------

[Email Jason Roberson](mailto: jroberson@forneytx.gov)  
Term Expires: 2025

Jason Roberson was elected as Mayor in 2023.

Goals
-----

I want to continue building Forney's infrastructure, as it is one of the top five fastest-growing cities in Texas.  I plan to continue striving for an ethical environment within the city, encouraging transparency and supporting first responders. With this focus, I believe our city and the surrounding region can be the premier destination spot for families to grow and prosper.

Background
----------

In May 2023, I was elected Mayor with 70% of votes cast. I was first elected to the Forney City Council in May 2021 as Council Member Place 6.   During that time, we were proactive on many fronts, including making a push for the city’s first forensic audit, coordinating a comprehensive plan for the city’s retail and housing future, and making the American Rescue Plan Act funds available to small businesses and residents in need.

 Outside of public service, my professional background is in communications — as a journalist, public relations executive, and ghostwriter of non-fiction books. Being an attentive listener and willing learner are the common threads between my public service and professional roles.

 I married Takisha Roberson, my college sweetheart, in April 2002. We’ve been blessed with two teenagers who both are enrolled in Forney I.S.D.
