Forney City Council, Mayor
--------------------------

[Email Jason Roberson](mailto: jroberson@forneytx.gov)
Term Expires: 2025

Jason Roberson was elected as Mayor in 2023.

I want to continue building Forney's infrastructure, as it is one of the top five fastest-growing cities in Texas.  I plan to continue striving for an ethical environment within the city, encouraging transparency and supporting first responders. With this focus, I believe our city and the surrounding region can be the premier destination spot for families to grow and prosper.

In May 2023, I was elected Mayor with 70% of votes cast. I was first elected to the Forney City Council in May 2021 as Council Member Place 6.   During that time, we were proactive on many fronts, including making a push for the city’s first forensic audit, coordinating a comprehensive plan for the city’s retail and housing future, and making the American Rescue Plan Act funds available to small businesses and residents in need.

I married Takisha Roberson, my college sweetheart, in April 2002. We’ve been blessed with two teenagers who both are enrolled in Forney I.S.D.
