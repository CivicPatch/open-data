Council Member Evan Porterfield brings a diverse professional background and a deep commitment to public service to his role on the Hutto City Council. A proud resident of Hutto for the past five years, Evan is dedicated to promoting transparency, efficiency, and fiscal responsibility in local government.

Evan’s professional experience spans ranch management, sales, and project management, with a career that includes work across both civilian and government sectors. This broad perspective allows him to approach city issues with a balanced, practical mindset and a strong focus on long-term sustainability through managed growth.

Frustrated by years of mismanagement and what he saw as poor financial decisions at the local level, Evan ran for City Council to help bring a new level of accountability and responsible leadership to Hutto. He believes government must be held to the same high standards as any business or household when it comes to budgeting and spending. At the heart of his philosophy is the conviction that every dollar taken from residents deserves close scrutiny and reconciliation.

Before joining the City Council, Evan served in several community leadership roles. He was President of his local HOA Board from 2022 to 2024, where he championed greater neighborhood engagement and operational transparency. As a local business owner in Downtown Hutto, he helped establish the Downtown Hutto Business Association and served as its President from 2023 to 2025, working to support and revitalize the local business community.
