### Biography of Kaylynn Paxson

Kaylynn Paxson was raised right here in Corpus Christi, where she fell in love with her city and the amazing people who make it a special and vibrant community. From an early age, Kaylynn was involved in serving this city through her participation in a crisis intervention ministry. This fueled her drive to help find ways to improve the quality of life and opportunities for whom she considers her neighbors: each community member.

As a leader in the hospitality industry, working as a director for several local service icons, she consistently pushed to promote the interests of our local businesses, recognizing the impact they have on the community.
"I truly value and appreciate the entrepreneurial spirit that has such a strong root in our community. In those leadership roles, it became very clear to me that we needed to find ways to improve the environment and our support for local small businesses. Success or failure in each of these businesses is more than whether a shop opens or closes; it impacts the lives of local families, their dreams, their investments, and the overall amenities of our area."

Having so much firsthand experience with the needs of the city, Paxson was determined to find a way to do her part to help create solutions by working together.

"Planning and being equipped is very important to me. I made the decision to pursue my education, focusing with intent on broadening my understanding and ability to serve, and gaining the training and tools that would specifically equip me to aid in providing the real help people need."

While determined to remain in her community, and work with the community to solve issues, she received her Bachelor's in Political Science and her Master's in Public Administration here at Texas A&M University – Corpus Christi. She is currently pursuing her PhD in Public Administration, focusing on Emergency Management, to be prepared to protect this district and our region from a variety of natural threats and vulnerabilities.

While actively pursuing her education, she became involved in local business associations and chambers of commerce. To further her opportunities to serve the community, she also joined several boards, committees, and organizations. She devoted her time on these committees to serve a variety of needs in the city, including advancing the conversation on homelessness, uniting efforts to support local business, and being very active and involved in the planning and strategizing of the future direction of this district. With her extensive education in Public Administration, and her proven results in years of public service, she currently works as the Director of Community Enrichment for a nearby municipality.

“We are set to truly be able to grow and strengthen our city and the lives of the incredible people who call it home. I know that working together we can accomplish all of our visions for this city. I’m ready to help make this a successful time for Corpus Christi.”
