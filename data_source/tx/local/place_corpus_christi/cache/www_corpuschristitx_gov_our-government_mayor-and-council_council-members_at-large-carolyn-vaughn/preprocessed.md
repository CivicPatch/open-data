### Biography of Carolyn Vaughn

Carolyn Vaughn is a proven conservative leader and business owner who is serving as an at-large member of the Corpus Christi City Council.

She was elected with the most votes of any at-large candidate during the most recent election. She previously served on the council from 2014 to 2018 as the representative from District 1 and as a Nueces County Commissioner from 2018 to 2021.

Life was not always easy for Carolyn. As one of eight children raised by a single mom, she worked in the school cafeteria to pay for her meals. Her father, who was abusive to both his wife and kids, was put in prison and Carolyn’s mother struggled to pay the bills and put food on the table. Then, in the 10th grade, Carolyn had to drop out of school to take care of her brother who had muscular dystrophy.
She got her GED, went to community college, and, with her husband Gary, raised a family and helped build a multi-million-dollar oil and gas business known as Gyro Technologies Inc. dba Vaughn Energy Services.
Carolyn has used those life lessons to serve the people of Corpus Christi and Nueces County and as a public servant has worked hard on pocketbook issues that affected her constituents, never voting for a tax increase and working to protect law enforcement. She is considered a leader in improving infrastructure and supporting transparency in government.
Currently, Carolyn is the co-owner with her daughter of Rustic Falls at the Vaughn Ranch, a wedding, reception and event venue, on the family’s 1650-acre ranch in George West.

Carolyn and her husband Gary have been married for more than 55 years and have three grown children, eight grandchildren and four great grandchildren. They are Evangelical Christians and live in the Calallen area of Corpus Christi.
