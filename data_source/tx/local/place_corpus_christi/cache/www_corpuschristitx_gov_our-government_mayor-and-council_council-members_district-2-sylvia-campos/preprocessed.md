### Biography of Sylvia Campos

Sylvia Campos is a native Corpus Christian, raised in Wiggins public housing on the City's Westside. The challenges of her impoverished childhood and being raised in a large family taught her the valuable lessons of listening, compromise, and teamwork. She graduated from Moody High School and attended Del Mar College before becoming a mother of two sons and a grandmother of six grandchildren. Sylvia is proud of her indigenous heritage, and therefore acknowledges that Corpus Christi stands on indigenous land, mainly of the Karankawa, Carrizo, Lipan, Tancahua, Comanche, Coahuiltecan, and several other Native American tribes.

For more than forty years, Sylvia has worked in the healthcare industry in administration, billing, and as an insurance specialist with particular emphasis on the financial field dealing with Medicare, Medicaid, and the CHIPS Program.

Sylvia served on the Parks and Recreation Board and chaired the effort to plant 12,000 trees in 2012. She worked with the respected AmeriCorps program for the Volunteer Center of the Coastal Bend in city clean-up plans. As an officer with the Corpus Christi League of Women Voters, she registered thousands of voters, and was hired by the Nueces County Sheriff's Organization to successfully help deputies place a collective bargaining measure on the ballot which passed with voter approval. She founded and curated Art for Social Justice as part of biennial forums held at Del Mar College.

Sylvia’s priorities are to protect the City’s greatest natural resources: the people and the environment that fuels the tourist economy. She has dedicated her life to standing up to powerful special interests and pushing back on tax breaks for wealthy corporations. She will advocate for neighborhood improvements; parks, public spaces, and libraries; affordable housing; safe drinking water; and increased access to healthcare.
