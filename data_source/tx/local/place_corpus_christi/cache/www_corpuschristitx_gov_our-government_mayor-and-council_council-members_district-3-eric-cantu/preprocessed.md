### Biography of Eric Cantu

Eric Cantu, elected to his first term on the Corpus Christi City Council in November 2024, represents District 3 with dedication and vision. Born and raised in Corpus Christi, Eric faced life-changing challenges at a young age, including the loss of his mother. Determined to support his family, he started his own business at just 18 years old and has been self-employed ever since. Over the past 20+ years, he has charted his own path as an entrepreneur, successfully operating small businesses across various industries.

As a council member, Eric is committed to reducing crime in District 3, collaborating with city leadership to ensure access to water for all residents, protecting taxpayers from high taxes, and transforming local animal shelters into no-kill facilities. Eric comes from a family of dedicated public servants, with both parents working for the United States Postal Service. Their example instilled in him a strong work ethic and an unwavering commitment to serving his community. Above all, Eric treasures his role as a father to three wonderful boys, with family and faith forming the foundation of his life.
