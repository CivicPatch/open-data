Biography
---------

After serving three consecutive terms as District 7 Council member, Dylan Hedrick was elected to his first term as Garland Mayor in June of 2025.

Upon moving to Garland in 2015, he immediately became involved in the Oakridge Neighborhood Association, first as the communications director, then as president. It was through the neighborhood association that he met former District 7 Council Member and Mayor Scott LeMay. He was soon appointed to Garland's Plan Commission, where he served more than two years. At the end of 2018, Dylan chaired the Citizen's Bond Study Committee and served as District 7 council representative for six years.   
   
 Dylan lives in Garland's Oakridge neighborhood with his wife, two daughters, and a son. Dylan works as a civil engineer for DIG Engineers, in Dallas, Texas. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering and a Masters of Business Administration from Rice University in Houston.

As mayor, Dylan hopes to combine his engineering background with his business expertise to help rebuild city infrastructure, further Garland's economic development, and promote a better quality of life. He believes Garland is the best place to live, work, and play in the Metroplex and will work hard to ensure it remains so.  
   
In his free time, he enjoys running the trails at Rowlett Creek Preserve, playing his guitar, and watching his daughters on the sidelines of a soccer field.
