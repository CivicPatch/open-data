Chris Ott, District 8 Council Member, was elected to his first term on the Garland City Council in May 2023.

Chris is an advocate of the business community, open spaces, the arts, and Garland history causes. For these, both he and his wife Kenia are tireless volunteers. They both participate in multiple boards and commissions of various types including Friends of Garlands Historic Magic 11

Having participated in both the Citizens Police Academy and the Citizens Fire Academy, he has a thorough appreciation for our First Responders.

Chris has been a small business owner, having founded his business Rotary Performance in Garland in 1988. This company, a specialty Mazda rotary engine company, operates to this day.

Chris moved to the Garland area from Lubbock, Texas, in 1984, graduating from Berkner High School in 1986. Chris attended Texas Tech University for Computer Science and is a graduate of Richland College. Following this, he studied History and Government at Southern Methodist University.
