Biography
---------

Jeff Bass, District 1 Council Member, was elected to the Garland City Council in May 2021.

He has spent most of his life in the Dallas area, living in Garland since 2008. He and his wife, Heather, have been married since 2004 and have one son, Preston, born in 2008.

His wife is a family practice physician for Baylor/Scott & White. Preston attends International Leadership of Texas school in Garland. Jeff is a franchise owner of two Dickey’s Barbecue Pit restaurants, one in Garland and one in Dallas and ABC Catering.

Jeff attended Brookhaven College and UTD. In addition to operating multiple restaurants, his work experience includes mortgage banking and operations management, as well as owning and managing multiple residential investment properties.

Jeff says owning his own business has opened opportunities to grow and become a better steward. “I love being a part of my community and the city of Garland and its citizens make it a joy to be involved.”

Jeff sat on the board of the Garland Chamber of Commerce (2017-2020), is a graduate of Leadership Garland (2015), and has chaired multiple committees (2015-present). He is a current board member for Garland Citizens Fire Club (2018-present). He sat on the advisory board for GISD Global Business Initiative (2015-2016), served on the board for Habitat for Humanity (2016-2017), and served on the board for Garland Economic Development Steering Committee (2018-2020)

“I look forward to working more closely with the community by representing District 1 on City Council,” says Jeff. “It is my passion for service that attracts me to become more involved.”
