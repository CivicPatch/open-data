Biography
---------

**Joe Thomas Jr.,** District 7 Council Member, was elected to his first term on the Garland City Council in May 2025.

Between Christmas and New Year’s 2010, he was blessed with a job transfer from California to Garland. At the time, Joe thought he was being banished from paradise. However, he quickly discovered that it was the best thing to ever happen to him. After settling in, he began talking to neighbors and eventually got involved in the Camelot Neighborhood Association, becoming president in 2020. Through the neighborhood association, Joe met former District 7 Council Member and outgoing Mayor Scott LeMay. He was appointed by LeMay to the 2019 Bond Study Committee and was appointed to the 2025 Bond Study Committee by District 7 Council Member Hedrick. He served as the chair of the 2025 committee.

Joe continues to live in Garland's Camelot neighborhood with his wife of 37 years, Diana, and three ornery kittens – Beau, Max and Penny. When not working for the betterment of Garland, Joe works as a software engineer at 4Front Engineered Solutions in Carrollton. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Business Management from the Oklahoma Christian University of Science and Arts in Edmond, Oklahoma.

As a member of the Council, Joe hopes to improve city infrastructure and continue Garland’s economic growth by delivering results from the bond package that residents recently approved … starting with fixing potholes! He loves Texas and wants to continue to position Garland as the jewel of the metroplex, a place where people of diverse backgrounds and experiences can all live their best lives.

In his free time, Joe enjoys playing golf and watching Major League Baseball. In fact, he has been to 44 ballparks while rooting for the Texas Rangers, Los Angeles Dodgers and whoever is playing the New York Yankees.
