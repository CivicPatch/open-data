Message from the City Administrator
-----------------------------------

It’s an honor to serve the people of Crockett. With the support of our Mayor and City Council, and the dedication of an outstanding professional staff, we are working every day to deliver a city government that is accountable, responsive, and future-focused.

Our priorities are clear: strengthen public safety, invest in reliable infrastructure, promote responsible job creation, and provide excellent customer service at City Hall and in the field. We’re challenging the status quo, measuring results, and making data-informed decisions to revitalize Crockett—block by block and project by project.

Your ideas matter. If you have suggestions to improve services, a concern about your neighborhood, or a vision for our community’s future, I want to hear from you. Please contact my office at 936-544-5156 or use the “Contact Us” page on our website.
