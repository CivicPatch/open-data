*The City of Howe, Texas is located in the fast-growing North Texas area less than an hour from the DFW Metroplex and is conveniently centered around major interstate US Highway 75 with a school district that touches Texas Highway 289.  This prime location has Howe positioned for rapid growth as more and more families look to move away from the “big city” and enjoy the benefits a thriving smaller community can offer.  The quality schools, interstate frontage, and moderate tax rate make Howe a prime location for new and relocating businesses.*
