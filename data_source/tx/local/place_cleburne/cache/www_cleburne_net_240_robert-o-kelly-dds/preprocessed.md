Councilman Derek Weathers
=========================

![Color portrait 3](https://www.cleburne.net/ImageRepository/Document?documentID=6849 "Color portrait 3")
Derek Weathers has been a resident of Cleburne since 2012, though his roots in the community run deeper as he was born in Cleburne and raised in nearby Godley. His family ties to the area stretch back generations, with his father owning the feed store under the Business 67 overpass, a place Derek spent time at nearly every week growing up.

Before beginning his career in business and construction management, Derek proudly served in the United States Army. From 2006 to 2011, he was on Active Duty, and from 2011 to 2017, he continued his service in the Reserves. He deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom 08–10 with the 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division. He also holds an associate degree in Business Management from Hill College in Cleburne.

Today, Derek is honored to serve as the Councilman for District 1. In addition to his role on City Council, he serves on the board of the Johnson County Food Bank and is an active member of the Lions Club, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Cleburne Christian Business Club.
