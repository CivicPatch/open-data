Councilman Oliver Cozby
=======================

![Oliver Ray Cozby](https://www.cleburne.net/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=12217)
Oliver Cozby is not a Cleburne native, but he got here as quickly as he could. Cozby moved to Cleburne in April 2023, and he immediately fell in love with the city. He said he hopes to bring a fresh voice and ideas to the council.
Cozby was elected to the Single-Member District 3 (SMD 3) seat on May 4, 2024 in a special election.
Although he's new to Cleburne, Cozby is well-versed in volunteer work and community involvement. He ran for Tarrant County clerk in his earlier days; and in college, he was president of his school's Republican Club. His love of serving continued.
"I've served as a state convention delegate and as sergeant at arms for two Senatorial conventions. I lived in Idaho for a brief time and served as precinct chairman there and have been involved in politics and other activities most of my life, " said Cozby.
Locally, Cozby, has volunteered to help out at the Cleburne Public Library and other city functions.
A U.S. Air Force veteran, Cozby is now retired, having worked for Bell Helicopter and the Department of Defense. A pastor as well, Cozby said he has a passion for working with and helping people, especially the homeless.
