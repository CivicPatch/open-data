Blake Jones is a lifelong Cleburne resident, dedicated public servant, entrepreneur, and local business leader. A 2008 graduate of Cleburne High School and a 2012 graduate of Texas Christian University with a degree in Communication Studies and a minor in Criminal Justice, Blake began his career in the hospitality industry where he met his wife, Jennifer. In 2013, he transitioned into the insurance industry, quickly becoming one of the youngest agents in Texas with Farmers Insurance. By 2015, Blake moved his business back home to Cleburne, where he and Jennifer are raising their two children, Aiden and Skyler.

Blake has served the Cleburne community in numerous leadership roles over the past decade, including executive board member of the Cleburne Chamber of Commerce, president of the Cleburne Rotary Club, and chair of the City’s Building and Standards Commission.

Currently, Blake serves as the District Chair of the Longhorn Council for the Boy Scouts of America providing support, training, and motivation to adult volunteers ensuring success of Scouting units within a 23-county region. He also serves on the Board of Directors for Texas Workforce Solutions for North Central Texas, where he helps guide efforts to connect employers with skilled workers, provide training and job placement services, and strengthen economic development across a 14-county region.

Today, Blake represents Single Member District 2 on the Cleburne City Council, where he also serves as Mayor Pro-Tem. Whether in business or public service, he remains focused on supporting first responders, strengthening partnerships community groups, and creating opportunities for families and youth in the city he proudly calls home.
