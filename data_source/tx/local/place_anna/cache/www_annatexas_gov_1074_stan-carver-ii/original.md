About Councilmember Stan Carver
-------------------------------

Councilmember Stan Carver II has been a resident of Anna, Texas for the past nine years. Born in Pensacola, Florida, he moved to Texas in elementary school and returned to Florida upon graduating from Sherman High School. Carver met his wife, Allison, on his 18th birthday, and they were married twenty months later.  They have four children, two are graduates of Anna High School, and their youngest having just graduated from McKinney Christian Academy.

Councilman Carver has been a life-long entrepreneur. His father had a landscaping and nursery business for which he worked each summer as a child. At age 20, Councilman Carver started his own business selling his design of audiovisual equipment. He pioneered this industry using the Amiga computer and Video Toaster, long before everyone’s cellphones could even record video.

Carver later moved to Dallas, Texas, and began working for KTEN television station and then a video production company. He continued improving his video production computers which developed into the Maverick Video Workstation, a complete system of broadcast-quality all-in-one TV and animation studio in-a-box!

After working a few years for Teledoc, a cutting-edge telehealth corporation, Mr. Carver became interested in pursuing another field. While he and his wife were visiting their daughter stationed at Nellis Air Force in Las Vegas, he visited a Capriotti’s restaurant one day on the way to hike in the mountains. He was hooked!

Carver and his oldest son began discussing purchasing a franchise and bringing Capriotti’s to Texas. He and his partners are currently opening restaurants in the DFW area and hope to have the first one operational by December 2021.

Carver plans to provide a positive place to work, eat, and play. He desires to offer competitive salaries and family-oriented dining for customers. He wants to serve his community by making it a better place to live. He is often quoted as having made his most meaningful friendships in Anna.

Carver has a passion for helping people by volunteering at church, his city, Rotary, and local government. He is currently serving as a councilman for the City of Anna, which he holds with the highest regard to make Anna the best place to live!
