About Councilmember Kevin Toten
-------------------------------

Councilman Kevin Toten is a graduate of Round Rock High School, where he was a member of the drumline and graduated with honors. After working for the Fleet Department of Chapman Construction for 14 years, Toten began working for the Fleet Department of a major utility company fixing and maintaining GPS systems.

Councilman Toten has lived in Anna for seven years, previously living in McKinney for 15. His interest in serving as a council member came from experiencing waterline issues in his neighborhood and working with the city to resolve the problems. Toten has always been a good neighbor who desires to help others and decided to serve on a board, or the council would allow him to do more. He’s known as the neighbor who will mow the lawn of a family tending to a loved one in the hospital, and his significant other often jokes that his honey-do list is mainly filled with requests from neighbors in need.

Councilman Toten organizes the annual First Responders Feast for Thanksgiving and Christmas and initiated the “Light the Town Blue” as a sign of support for our local law enforcement.

Councilman Toten enjoys spending time with his family and friends, woodworking, and fishing with his children in his free time. He has two sons, 9 and 11 and his girlfriend has a son and daughter.
