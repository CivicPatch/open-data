State law requires the filing of various forms by a candidate for city office. All candidates for city offices must file an “Appointment of a Campaign Treasurer by a Candidate” form with the city secretary before beginning their campaigns. Candidates who do not intend to accept more than $1,010 in political contributions or make more than $1,010 in political expenditures may file a modified reporting declaration and operate under modified reporting. Under modified reporting, the candidate is not required to file any further forms beyond the final report, which is filed at the end of the campaign. Semiannual reports may still be required in some cases. Candidates who intend to accept more than $1,010 in political contributions or make more than $1,010 in political expenditures, or who exceed that amount even after filing for modified reporting, must file under regular reporting requirements. Reports due under these requirements must be submitted by January 15 and July 15 of each year. The reports filed on these dates are known as semiannual reports. An opposed candidate in an upcoming city election who is using regular reporting must file reports of contributions and expenditures 30 days and 8 days before the election. A candidate in a runoff must file a report 8 days before the runoff election. Candidates filing under regular reporting are also required to file a final report at the end of the campaign.
