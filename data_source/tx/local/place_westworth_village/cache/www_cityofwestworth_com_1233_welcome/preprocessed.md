Welcome to the exciting city of Westworth Village!

Westworth Village is on the move. Our town features beautiful neighborhoods, a rapidly-expanding tax base, low taxes, recently-upgraded city infrastructure, an excellent financial condition, Hawks Creek Golf Club, a responsive government, and … a lot of wonderful people!

Westworth Village also enjoys an excellent and professional city staff, a wonderful small-town police force, and a city government that is both proactive in its planning and responsive to its citizens.

The city council meets on the second Tuesday of each month. We invite you to meet your councilmembers, attend the council meetings, and perhaps serve on one of the numerous council/citizen advisory committees. In Westworth Village, your voice and your involvement are actively encouraged.

Please browse our website, read our monthly newsletter, and most importantly please sign up for city texts and/or email notifications. We diligently try to keep you informed of what is going on in your city.
