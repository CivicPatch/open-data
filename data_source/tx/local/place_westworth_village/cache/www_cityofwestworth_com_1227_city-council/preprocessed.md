Westworth Village City Government
---------------------------------

Westworth Village is a Type A General Law Municipality, governed by a Mayor and five Council Members. Regular City Council meetings are held on the second Tuesday of every month at 7 pm at the Municipal Complex. The Mayor, City Administrator, City Secretary and Chief of Police are responsible for day-to-day operations.

City Hall is wheelchair accessible and handicapped parking spaces are available. Requests for accommodations for the hearing impaired must be made 48 hours prior to a posted meeting. Please contact the City Secretary for Assistance.

City Council
------------

The primary role of the city council is policymaking. To do so they must identify the needs of the citizens, then work to establish, maintain, or abolish programs to meet the ever-changing needs of the community as a whole. Councilmembers must follow all applicable state laws. In addition to setting laws that regulate the conduct and property of the citizens, they also levy taxes to maintain an effective budget, ensuring required city services are funded, including police, fire, EMS, and utilities.
