Mayor & Town Council
====================

Town Government
---------------

Highland Park operates under the Council–Manager form of government, which combines the leadership of an elected governing body with the professional management of a trained Town Administrator. The Mayor and Town Council set policy and direction for the community, while the Town Administrator oversees daily operations and implements policy as adopted by the Town Council.

Town Council
------------

The Town Council consists of the Mayor and five Council Members, all elected at large to serve two-year terms. Council Members serve without compensation and are limited to three successive terms. The Mayor Pro Tempore is appointed by the Mayor with Town Council approval.

A municipal election for the Mayor and Town Council is held on the first Saturday in May of even-numbered years.

Town Council Meetings & Study Session
-------------------------------------

The Town Council meets on the first and third Tuesday of each month at 8:00 a.m., followed immediately by a Study Session where staff provide operational updates and briefings on upcoming matters. Unless otherwise posted, Town Council meetings are held in the Council Chamber and Study Sessions in the Executive Conference Room, both on the second floor of Town Hall. All meetings and Study Sessions are open to the public.
