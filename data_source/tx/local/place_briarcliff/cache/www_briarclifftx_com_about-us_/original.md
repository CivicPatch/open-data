About Us
========

Briarcliff, Texas, is located in the beautiful Hill Country on the south shore of Lake Travis, 30 miles west of Austin in Travis County and part of the highly acclaimed Lake Travis Independent School District.

The community offers many amenities for young and old alike with nature trails, a disc golf course, a shaded park as well as a community center and dog park. Launch a boat at Briarcliff Marina, hit a few balls at Willie's 9-hole golf course, or enjoy a meal or music at our local restaurant. Briarcliff has something for everyone.

There are two governing bodies in Briarcliff. The Village of Briarcliff (VOB) is the city government and owns and maintains the water system and roads for Briarcliff and nearby subdivisions. Briarcliff Property Owners Association (BPOA), is an HOA that maintains the park and other amenities. Together, the Village City Council and BPOA Board work to create and maintain a safe and fun hill country atmosphere for the approximately 2062 residents of Briarcliff.

Travis County Constables, Precinct 4, provide law enforcement, along with Travis County Sheriff's Department, Travis County Constables Precinct 3, and Pace Bend Park Police when needed. Emergency needs are attended to by the Pedernales Fire Department, ESD 8. Fire Station 1 is located at the main entrance of the city.
