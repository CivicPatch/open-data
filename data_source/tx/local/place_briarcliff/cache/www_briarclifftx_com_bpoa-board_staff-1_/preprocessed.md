To better serve our community and ensure all concerns are addressed efficiently and consistently, we’re asking all residents to follow the proper communication channels when reaching out to the BPOA Office, Board of Directors or Property Management Team.
Here’s how to make sure your requests and questions get to the right place:
For general issues or requests, please email the office at
[theoffice@briarcliff-poa.com](mailto:theoffice@briarcliff-poa.com)
. This creates an electronic record we can refer to and helps us track your request. You're still welcome to call the office, but depending on the situation, the staff may ask you to follow up via email for documentation purposes.
If you need to contact the Board, please do not reach out to individual board members directly. Instead, send your requests or concerns to
[theoffice@briarcliff-poa.com](mailto:theoffice@briarcliff-poa.com)
, and your message will be routed appropriately.
We’ve updated the name of this team (formerly Roads & Grounds) to better reflect their role, as the BPOA no longer owns and maintains the roads. For any issues related to BPOA property – such as trails, parks, or common areas – or if you have general questions, comments, or would like to volunteer for upcoming projects, please submit a request here:
[BPOA Property Management Team Communications Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdo5Fnk83guJWV8cFtG1cKjGRwWETIaB-B_W3CdRFnC_NuCyA/viewform)
.
Following these steps helps us stay organized and respond more quickly and thoroughly. We truly appreciate your cooperation and continued support in keeping Briarcliff a great place to live!
