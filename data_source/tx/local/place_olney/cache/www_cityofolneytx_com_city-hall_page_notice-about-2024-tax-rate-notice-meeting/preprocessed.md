Notice About 2024 Tax Rate & Notice of Meeting
==============================================

A tax rate of $0.978200 per $100 valuation has been proposed by the governing body of City of Olney.

The no-new-revenue tax rate is the tax rate for the 2024 tax year that will raise the same amount of property tax revenue for City of Olney from the same properties in both the 2023 tax year and the 2024 tax year.
The voter-approval rate is the highest tax rate that the City of Olney may adopt without holding an election to seek voter approval of the rate.

The proposed tax rate is greater than the no-new-revenue tax rate. This means that the City of Olney is proposing to increase property taxes for the 2024 tax year.

**A PUBLIC HEARING ON THE PROPOSED TAX RATE WILL BE HELD ON September 12, 2024, at 8:15AM at Olney City Hall-Council Chambers, 201 E. Main, Olney, TX.**

The proposed tax rate is not greater than the voter-approval tax rate. As a result, the City of Olney is not required to hold an election at which voters may accept or reject the proposed tax rate. However, you may express your support for or opposition to the proposed tax rate by contacting the members of the City Council of City of Olney at their offices or by attending the public meeting mentioned above.

FOR the proposal: Mayor Pro-Tem: Chuck Stennett. Council Members: Thea Sullivan & Terri Wipperman

PRESENT and not voting: Mayor: Rue Rogers

ABSENT: Council Member: Ronnie Cowart

The 86th Legislature modified the manner in which the voter-approval tax rate is calculated to limit the rate of growth of property taxes in the state.
The following table compares the taxes imposed on the average residence homestead by the City of Olney last year to the taxes proposed to be imposed on the average residence homestead by the City of Olney this year.

For assistance with tax calculations, please contact the tax assessor for the City of Olney at (940) 549-2392 or
