---------------

Hello! The City Council and I are pleased to welcome you to the city's website. Mission offers a unique cultural experience, including but not limited to historical landmarks, a museum, entertainment attractions, an annual parade, outdoor recreational facilities, and amazing scenic beauty. The comfortable weather and climate of Mission, as well as our citizens' friendly hospitality, ensure that Mission has something for everyone, including our neighbors to the south and our friends from the north. A rapidly expanding population accommodated by a growing business community and the city's highly trained and capable administration and staff have made Mission an ideal location to visit, do business, or call home. We hope that you find our website informative, and if you have any questions or need any information, please contact our city offices at 956-580-8662. Once again, welcome to the City of Mission, Texas.
