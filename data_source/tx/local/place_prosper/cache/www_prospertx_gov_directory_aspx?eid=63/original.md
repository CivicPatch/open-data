David and his family have lived in Prosper since 2001. David’s first career was in the military. He is a 1987 US Air Force Academy graduate and a former active-duty fighter pilot. He flew F-111Fs and F-15Es while he and his family lived in Europe and was deployed to numerous contingency operations throughout the world. He is a decorated combat veteran and has been awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross as well as many other citations and awards. He retired from the military in 2007 and was awarded the Congressional Veterans Commendation by former Congressman Sam Johnson in 2017.

In 1997, David co-founded Employee Solutions, a regional staffing firm with over $1 billion in revenue since creation, and over 1,000 employees. This company served clients in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri and was sold to a strategic buyer in 2023. He has been and continues to be a serial entrepreneur, creating and running businesses in a variety of industries, including insurance and auto care.

In addition to his professional accomplishments, David has been dedicated to the Town of Prosper. In May 2022, he was elected as the Mayor, and in 2025 he was reelected unopposed.  David served on the Prosper Town Council from 2004-2008 and was twice elected Mayor Pro-Tem.  Since 2016, he has served on the Prosper Economic Development Corporation, including as President. David has also served regionally, as the Chairman of the North Central Texas Workforce Development Board for several years, and as Governor Greg Abbott’s appointee to the Red River Boundary Commission in 2020. In 2024, David was elected to serve on the Executive Board of the North Central Texas Council of Governments.

David and his wife Mendy have been married since 1989 and have three adult children, all of whom are graduates of Prosper ISD. They are also blessed to have three granddaughters, who all live in Prosper, and spending time with them is their true passion.
