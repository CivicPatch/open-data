----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar announced the City of Farmersville is the latest local government entity to achieve a Transparency Star as recognition of excellence in Traditional Finances.

Transparency Stars recognizes local government entities that provide easy online access to important financial data. The Comptroller’s office launched the Transparency Stars program in March 2016 to recognize cities, counties and school districts making important strides to greater government transparency.

“The City of Farmersville has shown a continued commitment to providing taxpayers with a clear and meaningful analysis of its financial data. This effort achieves the goals set by my office’s Transparency Stars program,” Hegar said. “I am pleased to recognize [name of entity] for going above and beyond in its transparency efforts and being awarded for receiving the Traditional Finances Transparency Star.”
