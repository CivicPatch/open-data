The City of Farmersville Receives Recognition for Transparency Efforts in Traditional Finances
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![blue shooting star](https://www.farmersvilletx.com/sites/g/files/vyhlif15936/files/styles/full_node_primary/public/media/mayor-council/image/91/transpstarslogotradfin300w.png.webp?itok=BjAeUJNc)

Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar announced the City of Farmersville is the latest local government entity to achieve a Transparency Star as recognition of excellence in Traditional Finances.

Transparency Stars recognizes local government entities that provide easy online access to important financial data. The Comptroller’s office launched the Transparency Stars program in March 2016 to recognize cities, counties and school districts making important strides to greater government transparency.

Local government entities can apply for stars in the areas of:

* Traditional Finances,
* Contracts and Procurement,
* Economic Development,
* Public Pensions, and
* Debt Obligations,
* Open Government and Compliance

“The City of Farmersville has shown a continued commitment to providing taxpayers with a clear and meaningful analysis of its financial data. This effort achieves the goals set by my office’s Transparency Stars program,” Hegar said. “I am pleased to recognize [name of entity] for going above and beyond in its transparency efforts and being awarded for receiving the Traditional Finances Transparency Star.”

After receiving an initial star for Traditional Finances, remaining stars may be awarded in any order. For more information on the program, including specific guidelines and information on how to apply, visit the Comptroller’s [Transparency Stars website](https://comptroller.texas.gov/transparency/local/stars/ "(opens in a new window)").
