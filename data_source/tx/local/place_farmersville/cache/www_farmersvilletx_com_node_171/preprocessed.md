(PDF) - City Ordinance for Public Information Requests.

We have provided a form that you may submit electronically. You will need to submit the form to City Hall. All requests must be in writing. The form permits you to request one check at a time. If you need to request more than one check at a time, please submit your request in writing to
[email](mailto:d.hamlin@farmersvilletx.com)
and provide the information as noted on the form. If you just want an answer to “what was this for?” we will provide it to you in a return email.  If you want copies, there may be a charge for paper copies. If the request is lengthy, there may also be labor charges. If there is a cost involved, we require a deposit upfront before the copies are made. Settlement will be at the time the request is delivered to you. Each transaction includes the description of the expense line where it was recorded; these descriptions may answer most of your questions.

The request must be in writing and must be addressed to the governmental body. While the request does not need to be addressed to any particular person, it is a good practice to clearly label your correspondence as a "Public Information Request" or "Open Records Request." Requests sent via fax must be addressed to the public information officer or to the person designated by that officer to receive such requests. You can email public information requests to the City Secretary.

The Act provides that a governmental body must respond "promptly" to a request for information. If a governmental body is unable to produce the requested information within ten business days, the officer for public information must send you correspondence certifying that he is unable to do so and he must set a date and time when the records will be available to you.

The Open Records Act provides that we respond "promptly" to a request for information. We will contact you as soon as we have the answer which should be fairly quickly. We do have ten days, but if we cannot produce the requested information within ten business days, we will notify you and will set a date and time when the information will be provided.

May a Governmental Body Ask Me Why I Want the Records?

**Within ten business days of receiving a written request, the governmental body must:**

**Within fifteen business days of receiving your request, the governmental body must:**

* provide copies of the documents requested or a representative sample of the documents to the Attorney General and the documents must be labeled to show which exceptions apply to which parts of the documents.
