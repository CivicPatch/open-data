Brian Crull is a dynamic force within the Gun Barrel City community, bringing with him a wealth of experience and a passion for serving others. Relocating from Dallas in May of 2020, Brian has quickly established himself as an integral member of the community.

As the proud owner of Crull Fitness, a sport-specific training facility with over three decades of history, Brian has dedicated his career to shaping athletes of all levels, from amateur to professional. His expertise extends to preparing college and high school athletes for success in both collegiate sports and the NFL. With his son, Philip, at the helm of PM3 Sports Agency as an NFL Agent, the Crull family is deeply entrenched in the world of sports and athlete development.

Beyond his professional endeavors, Brian has made significant contributions to the Gun Barrel City community through his involvement in various civic roles. Serving on the Planning and Zoning Commission for two years and as Vice President of the Economic Development Board of Directors for an additional two years, Brian has demonstrated a commitment to fostering growth and development within the city.

Brian's dedication to public service culminated in his election as Mayor of GBC in November of 2023, a position for which he ran unopposed in the 2024 election. His priorities as mayor are clear: animal control, economic development, and the establishment of a community center. Collaborating closely with Dr. Smith, the city manager, and her staff, Brian is committed to leading Gun Barrel City forward in various areas of governance.

In addition to his local initiatives, Brian actively engages with surrounding municipalities and their leaders, recognizing the importance of regional collaboration. Through his efforts, he seeks to harness the collective power of the Cedar Creek Lake plex, working hand in hand with mayors, city managers, and Economic Development Corporations to benefit all residents of the area.

Brian Crull's vision, leadership, and dedication to service are driving forces behind the continued growth and prosperity of Gun Barrel City and the greater Cedar Creek Lake community. As he continues to lead with passion and purpose, Brian's impact will be felt for years to come.
