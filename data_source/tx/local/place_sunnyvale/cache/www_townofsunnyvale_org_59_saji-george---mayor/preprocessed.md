Saji George - Mayor
===================

A long time commitment to remaining a lower density community with focus on maintaining a strong rural element, an exemplary school district and citizens who are active and involved in the events of the community are the hallmarks of Sunnyvale’s difference from any other city or Town. Ours is a community of special qualities and equally special people who moved here because it isn’t like anywhere else.

It is our hope that all who live here, move here or merely visit for a while will find their Sunnyvale experience a special one. As your governance team, your Mayor and Town Council are focused on enhancing the quality of life in Sunnyvale while continuously striving to improve our public services and customer service by the staff of the Town.

The Mayor’s Responsibility
--------------------------

My responsibility as Mayor is to serve all citizens and business owners of Sunnyvale fairly and openly. I am committed to doing just that in the most professional and timely manner possible. I encourage you to call on me if you need support or answers or if I can be of service to you.

Mayor’s Background
------------------

I am a devoted husband to my wife, Jaya, for more than 30 years, we have called Sunnyvale home for 25 years, and we have two grown children. While the Town has grown quite a bit and changed in several ways since we first moved here, it retains the same unique character and vitality as it did when we came here. I am confident that your experience in Sunnyvale will be similar.
