Cornel D. Benford II's journey from the Southside of Chicago to his current role in Glenn Heights, Texas, reflects a life dedicated to growth, community, and public service. A native of Quincy, IL, Cornel was raised in Chicago, graduating from Hyde Park Academy in 2002—a school with an illustrious list of alumni, including the pioneering aviator Amelia Earhart and the legendary musician Herbie Hancock. It was here, stimulated by an AP U.S. History class and an inspiring encounter with Illinois Senators Dick Durbin and Peter Fitzgerald, that Cornel's passion for politics was kindled.
He furthered his education at DePaul University, earning a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems in 2007. Throughout his college years, Cornel remained deeply engaged in student life and community service contributing as a student manager for the Women's Softball and Women's Basketball teams and participating in various student organizations and serving as college chapter president of the Nu Rho Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha, Fraternity Inc. (Spring 2003).
Upon graduating, Cornel embarked on a professional path that saw him transition from a Junior Software Engineer at BlueCross Blue Shield Association to a skilled expert in outside sales. His career with companies such as Coca-Cola, 3M, and Pfizer Pharmaceuticals prompted moves from Chicago to Southern California and then to Fort Worth, TX. Today, Cornel resides in Glenn Heights, TX, where he excels as a Solution Architect for a leading Bio-medical device company.
Family is the cornerstone of Cornel's life. He cherishes his marriage to Jamie (Funn) Benford and is a dedicated father to three children, Charles (11), Lauryn (8), and Lenroc (3). In his cherished moments of leisure, he immerses himself in literature, strategic games of chess, and joyful times with his pet Rottweiler, Bella.
Having called Glenn Heights home for over four years, Cornel has invested his energy into enriching the community. He is a fervent advocate for enhancing Sports and Recreation programs, driven by a belief that vibrant community activities are fundamental to a city's well-being. Cornel lives by the maxim, “Do not confuse activity with results,” a philosophy that guides his approach to both his professional career and his public service aspirations.

*Mayor Sonja A. Brown, Mayor Pro Tem Cornel Benford II, student participants, and chaperones
prepare to depart for Washington, D.C. to attend the 2025 Close Up Program.*

Mayor Pro Tem Cornel Benford II proudly introduced the Close Up Program to the City of Glenn Heights, bringing a powerful civic engagement opportunity to local students. As a former participant himself during high school in Chicago, IL, Mayor Pro Tem Benford understands firsthand the impact of this transformative experience. Since 1971, over one million students and educators have participated in Close Up programs, whose mission is to inspire young people to find their unique voice and develop the skills needed to be active, informed citizens.

Close Up uses the city as a living classroom, offering high school students an immersive experience in Washington, D.C., where they make personal connections with the people and institutions shaping our nation. On March 9, 2025, the City of Glenn Heights sponsored 8 students—four from DeSoto High School and four from Red Oak High School, and 2 chaperones—to attend this once-in-a-lifetime program. Through dynamic discussions, hands-on activities, and real-world learning, these students will be empowered to explore diverse viewpoints, experience history and government in action, and strengthen the skills of engaged citizenship.
