Sonja A. Brown was raised to advocate and leave her community better than it was when she got there. Entering the world in 1972 to socially driven parents, she was introduced to social organizations at an early age and rallied alongside her parents for the rights of others.

Once she reached the legal voting age, she made sure she registered to vote and encouraged her peers to do the same. Sonja walked her college campus talking with fellow students about the importance of voting and assisted them with voter registration to ensure their voices were heard. In 2008 she became a deputy voter registrar, setting up voter registration drives throughout her city. She is a lifelong student. She holds a Bachelor of Administration in Business Management and continues to expand her social knowledge with courses in political science, global diplomacy, and ethics.

Sonja made the decision to run for City Council of Glenn Heights, TX in 2018. She ran against four others in what everyone thought would end in a run-off election. On November 6, 2018, election night, she was declared the winner with over 54% of the city’s votes. Less than 15 months later, her fellow Councilmembers unanimously elected her Mayor Pro Tem. While serving her third term as Mayor Pro Tem, Sonja made another important decision, to declare herself a mayoral candidate during the 2022 midterm elections. She continued her duties as Mayor Pro Tem, ran a successful campaign against three opponents, took 60% of the votes, and became the city’s first African American female mayor. She serves as an example for all young ladies aspiring to make a difference.

Mayor Brown recognizes that anything worth fighting for will come with a challenge. She continues to stand firm in the face of adversity to fight the good fight. She is hardworking, dedicated, and steadfast in her pursuit to take her city and community higher. She embodies the bold, vibrant leadership needed to propel Glenn Heights to the next level. Mayor Brown instituted the A.C.E Award, recognizing scholars for Academic and Character Excellence. She is responsible for the city’s COVID-19 vaccination clinic during the pandemic, the city’s first-ever Citizens Police Advisory Committee (CPAC), and she began The Guardian Program - a program that helps first responders readily identify an individual who may have special needs or is nonverbal. She is also responsible for the city's first ever Hispanic Heritage Month Festival, another great event to bring residents together. The A.C. E. Award, vaccination clinic, CPAC, The Guardian Program, and the Hispanic Heritage Festival speak to Mayor Brown’s commitment to improving the quality of life for all. She looks forward to continued collaboration with city staff and elected officials, across the nation, for the advancement of her community.

With her infectious smile and rope-a-dope approach to life, we are sure to see Mayor Sonja A. Brown standing tall and fighting for the rights of others for years to come.

*Mayor Sonja A. Brown, Mayor Pro Tem Cornel Benford II, student participants, and chaperones
prepare to depart for Washington, D.C. to attend the 2025 Close Up Program.*

Former Mayor Pro Tem Cornel Benford II proudly introduced the Close Up Program to the City of Glenn Heights, bringing a powerful civic engagement opportunity to local students. As a former participant himself during high school in Chicago, IL, Mayor Pro Tem Benford understood firsthand the impact of this transformative experience. Since 1971, over one million students and educators have participated in Close Up programs, whose mission is to inspire young people to find their unique voice and develop the skills needed to be active, informed citizens.

Close Up uses the city as a living classroom, offering high school students an immersive experience in Washington, D.C., where they make personal connections with the people and institutions shaping our nation. For the second year, the City of Glenn Heights will sponsor 8 students in 2026 — four from DeSoto High School and four from Red Oak High School, and 2 chaperones — to attend this once-in-a-lifetime program. Through dynamic discussions, hands-on activities, and real-world learning, these students will be empowered to explore diverse viewpoints, experience history and government in action, and strengthen the skills of engaged citizenship.
