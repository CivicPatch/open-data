Attending Meetings and Addressing the City Council
--------------------------------------------------

City Council meetings are held on the second and fourth Tuesday of each month at 7 p.m. in the Council Chambers at Allen City Hall, 305 Century Parkway. Prior to the meeting, there’s a workshop at 6 p.m. in the Council Conference Room. Both the meetings and workshops are open to the public.

You can address the City Council on both agenda and non-agenda items. Here’s how:

* The
  Public Speaker Request Form
  is available online starting the Friday before the meeting at 5 p.m. and until 5 p.m. on the meeting day. After 5 p.m., paper forms are available in the Council Chambers.
* Paper forms must be handed to the City Secretary before the meeting begins.
* When called, go to the podium, state your name and address for the record, and discuss your topic. Groups are encouraged to select one spokesperson.
