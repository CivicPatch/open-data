Councilmember Kelly Brynteson
=============================

Kelly g![Kelly](https://www.lakeway-tx.gov/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=42871)rew up in a small farming community in MN and moved to the Twin Cities for college. She graduated with a BA in Journalism from the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul along with earning other degrees and certificates. Her husband Glen lived in Austin in the early 1990s and always wanted to move back. Loving the charm and small town feel, they chose Lakeway as their forever home in 2007. Kelly and Glen have two young children in Lake Travis ISD, attend Lake Hills Church and enjoy everything that Lakeway has to offer. They cannot imagine a better place to raise their family.

Kelly works in competitive intelligence which is a very strategic, analytical and innovative field and it drives her to look at issues and concepts differently. Through her career, she acquired the ability to build consensus among key stakeholders which is an ideal skill set for council. Kelly and Glen are business owners with local and international reach in the areas of: mergers and acquisitions; competitive intelligence / customer experience; learning management system solutions; and credit card processing.

Prior to her council seat, Kelly served on the City of Lakeway Arts Committee. Passionate about giving back, she is an active volunteer for several non-profit organizations throughout the greater Austin area as well as right here in Lakeway. Collectively, she has helped raise more than $140,000 through the donation of her art for charity auctions. Some of the non-profits Kelly has partnered with are: Mack, Jack & McConaughey; Center for Child Protection; Cheyanna's Champions 4 Children (CC4C); The Rise School of Austin; 12:31; The BLESS Foundation; Ashley's Angels; and for her children's school, Lakeway Elementary PTO. During a business trip, a chance encounter gave Glen the idea to start a non-profit to provide military veterans and their spouses with online niche business training. Kelly is now a proud Program Liaison and she often attends business conferences where she leads veterans through their program.
