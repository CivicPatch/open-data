1. Mayor & City Council

Mayor & City Council
====================

The City Council is the “governing body of the city.” It is made up of seven members (mayor and six councilmembers). The City Charter requires that all councilmembers be volunteers. All councilmembers are elected “at large.” The mayor represents the city at ceremonies and events.
The mayor’s vote carries the same weight as that of each councilmember and cannot override or veto council decisions.
The mayor does set the agenda for council meetings and also acts as the city’s spokesperson when needed.

* All office holders for city elective office shall meet the requirements for public office prescribed by state and federal law, as well as the City Charter of the City of Lakeway. They must be registered voters, residing in the city for at least one year prior to the election and be at least 21 years of age by the date of the election. Members of the council shall serve without pay or compensation.

* First Monday of each month at 6:30 p.m. (as needed)
* Third Monday of each month at 6:30 p.m.
* Lakeway City Hall council chambers
