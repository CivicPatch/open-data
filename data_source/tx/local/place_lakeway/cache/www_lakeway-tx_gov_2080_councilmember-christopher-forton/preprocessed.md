Chris was born and raised in Michigan just outside Detroit. He has had several careers from working on the assembly line building Jeeps, being a fire firefighter/paramedic, a retail manager, and is currently an annuity and life insurance specialist. Chris and his family moved to Lakeway back in 2014. He has been an active volunteer ever since his arrival. Some notable activities include being an LTYA coach, SHE room volunteer, volunteer with Friends of the Parks, volunteer with Mobile Loaves and Fishes, as well as Honor Flight Austin, Trusted World, and has been a prop dad at WADA and with the Lake Travis High School Cavalettes. He also spent five years on the Lakeway Zoning and Planning Commission, several of which were as chairman. He has been on the Planned Unit Development Committee and serves as the council liaison to the wildlife advisory committee. His kids also volunteer in National Charity League, Youth Men’s Service League, and both are serving on Cavs in Service.

Chris’ vision for Lakeway is to keep it an amazing place to live, raise a family, and retire. Spending a lot of time on our hiking trails and on Lake Travis has given him the passion to maintain these amenities for future generations. His priorities are making sure we protect and enhance our parks and trails. Some work, like replacing lost trees along Lakeway Blvd needs to start now to ensure future generations have a shaded area to walk and meet with neighbors. He also wants to make sure we use our tax dollars wisely and are fiscally conservative. Despite a busy schedule, Chris always makes time for those that he serves and looks forward to meeting more of you in the coming years!
