Message from the Mayor
======================

Welcome to the City of Port Aransas website. I am hopeful that you will find it useful and informative.
On this website, you will find a wealth of information about our City Charter, City Council, Boards/Commissions/Committees, and the many plans and activities of various City Departments.
If you are a visitor, welcome to our community. Port A is a great family vacation destination. Our world-class beach, fishing, bird watching, and other activities will provide you with what we know will be an enjoyable stay.
The Port Aransas Chamber of Commerce and Tourist Bureau's website (www.portaransas.org) is also an excellent place to get valuable information on events and activities, places to stay, eat and shop and a complete business directory.
If you are looking for a place to live you can't beat 'the island life'! Our City is proactive when it comes to our infrastructure improvements and our Parks & Recreation system actively supports family activities.
We are very proud of our award-winning school district - Port Aransas Independent School District (PAISD) - which is highly ranked in our State. Our school system provides a great education for our children and is an absolute necessity for those families who want to live and work on the island.
If you are looking for a great place to live or raise a family be sure and check us out!
I welcome your comments, questions, and ideas. Please feel free to email me at
