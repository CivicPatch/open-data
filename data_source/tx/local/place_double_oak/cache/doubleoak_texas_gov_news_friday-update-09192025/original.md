Double Oak - Friday Update (09/19/2025)
---------------------------------------

### Upcoming Double Oak Public Meeting Dates

Town Council Meeting on Monday October 6th at 7pm at the Town Hall

Town Council Meeting on Monday October 20th at 7pm at the Town Hall

### Upcoming Events in Double Oak

·        **National Night Out –** October 7, 2025

·        **Household Hazardous Waste and Clean up Event** - Saturday November 8, 2025, Town Hall parking lot

·        **Double Oak Turkey Trot –** November 27, 2025

### Double Oak Town Council Approves 2025-2026 Budget

The Town Council of Double Oak adopted the Fiscal Year 2025–2026 operating budget on September 15, 2025, with total expenditures and revenues balanced at $2,725,470 an increase of 3.82% over the prior year. The adopted property tax rate of $0.178384 per $100 of assessed valuation remains unchanged. Because assessed values increased, this rate brings in about $57,713 more in property tax revenue, a 4.47% increase over last year.

General Fund revenues include $1.35 million from property taxes, $730,000 from sales and use taxes, $235,750 from franchise fees, and $177,600 from court revenue. Smaller revenue streams include $58,100 from licenses and permits, $21,000 from service charges, and $151,055 from other sources. On the expenditure side, the largest allocation about 55.7% of the total budget goes to the Police Department ($1,502,688), reflecting a new step‑based salary structure and the creation of a Vehicle Replacement Fund. Administration is budgeted at $732,331; Public Works at $324,125; the Double Oak Volunteer Fire Department (DOVFD) at $125,103; and the Municipal Court at $41,222.

In addition to operations, the budget includes $50,000 for routine street repairs, $58,000 for drainage maintenance, and $10,000 for MS4 stormwater compliance. These are for upkeep and regular maintenance. Meanwhile, larger road improvements like mill and overlay projects are still planned and will be paid for out of our fund balances, as in past years not out of the general operating budget.

Special revenue funds for child safety, court technology, and court security were approved, and a dedicated Vehicle Replacement Fund of $83,960 was established. Ordinances 25‑05 and 25‑06 were passed to formally adopt the budget and levy the ad valorem tax rate.

To enhance fiscal transparency, accountability, and the usefulness of our financial reports, the Town is also moving to adopt GASB Statement No. 54 (Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions), concurrently with implementing the new Tyler financial software system. GASB 54 provides more precise and uniform classifications for fund balance such as Non‑spendable, Restricted, Committed, Assigned, and Unassigned which clarify how much of the Town’s funds are constrained by legal, contractual, or policy obligations versus free for use. This move will improve the clarity and consistency of our financial reporting, strengthen internal policies, and help ensure that decision-making reflects a full and accurate understanding of available resources.

The Town of Double Oak extends sincere thanks to our Town Administrator, Chris Laugenour, Lynn Jones and Laura Meilinger for their detailed work, time, and dedication throughout this budget process. Their diligence and preparation ensured the Council had accurate and transparent data to support sound decision-making. We also thank the many citizens who participated in our budget workshops and public meetings, offering valuable insight, feedback, and perspective. And finally, a heartfelt thank-you to the Town Council, whose thoughtful review, commitment to fiscal responsibility, and due diligence demonstrate their continued dedication to protecting the long-term interests of the Town and its residents.

### Property Update: FM 407 and Simmons Road

As of **9/19/2025** No Additional Information on this property has been shared with Town Hall or any appointments requested.

The town is currently having discussions with professional Planning Consultants to assist if or when this development could happen.  These are professionals that do this for a living and assist small towns like Double Oak to ensure that new business developments are done correctly.  This information will be brought to Town Council at a future meeting if development would move forward.

*The property at the corner of FM 407 and Simmons Road has long been identified as one of the last available parcels in Double Oak for retail or mixed-use development. The land has been listed for sale for many years, and recently the Town was notified by the property’s realtor that a potential contract is now pending.*

*Over the past three years, several developers have informally inquired about this site, but this is the first indication of a pending sale. If a developer moves forward, the project must follow the Town’s established ordinance-driven process before anything can be approved.*

The town will continue to provide updates as information becomes available.

### Double Oak Police Speed Tracker Trailer Statistics

Speed Tracker Results will now be provided on the eCode360 website at the link below with the latest results. The trailer will stay at specific locations for extended periods as we continue to analyze the data to assist in staffing our patrol hours at different locations.

### Speed Trailer Summary – 200 Kings Road

**Date Range**: September 11–18, 2025

**Location**: 200 Kings Road, Double Oak, TX

**Posted Speed Limit**: 30 mph

**Total Vehicles Recorded**: 21,586

- Eastbound (Closing): 10,548

- Westbound (Away): 11,038

**Speed Compliance Breakdown**

**Category Eastbound Westbound Combined Total**

Vehicles at or Below 30 mph 5,155 4,733 9,888 (45.8%)

Vehicles Over 30 mph 5,393 6,305 11,698 (54.2%)

Vehicles Over 40 mph (Excessive) 29 161 190 (0.88%)

Average Violation Speed 33.01 mph 33.55 mph 33.3 mph

**Speed Profile**

·         Average Speed: 30.87 mph

·         85th Percentile Speed: 34 mph

·         Most Common Speed Range (Pace): 26–35 mph

·         Peak Speed Recorded: 95 mph

·         Minimum Speed Recorded: 12 mph

·         Standard Deviation: 4 mph

**Peak Times & Patterns**

·         Traffic volume was heaviest during morning and afternoon commute hours, especially 6 AM – 9 AM and 2 PM – 5 PM.

·         The highest levels of excessive speeding occurred during late afternoon hours, with a noticeable spike in westbound speeds.

·         Although the majority of vehicles fell within or near the 10 mph pace range, some notable outliers reached dangerous speeds above 40 mph, with a handful nearing 95 mph.

**Summary & Observations**

Over the one-week period, just over half of drivers exceeded the posted 30 mph limit, with nearly 1 in 10 exceeding 35 mph and 0.88% exceeding 40 mph. While the average speed hovered close to the speed limit, the consistent westbound speeding and extreme high speeds raise safety concerns particularly given the residential nature of the area.  
   
 The data supports continued monitoring, and potentially targeted enforcement, especially during peak afternoon travel hours. Overall, the results indicate relatively moderate speeding behavior, but highlight the need to deter extreme violators and reinforce safe driving along Kings Road.

### Reminders:

New Safety Measures for Double Oak Public Meetings

In response to rising safety concerns at public meetings across the country, the Town of Double Oak is implementing enhanced procedures to ensure a secure and respectful environment for all attendees. While Double Oak remains a close-knit and civically engaged community, recent discussions such as those surrounding a proposed helistop have drawn heightened attention and commentary on social media platforms like Facebook. As community participation grows, so does the importance of maintaining safe and orderly public forums.

Under the direction of Police Chief Daniel Miller, and in consultation with the Denton County Fire Marshal, new safety protocols will now be in place for all public meetings held at Town Hall. These include Town Council, Planning & Zoning Commission, Board of Adjustments, and any special-called meetings. Attendees will pass through a metal detector screening, and all bags will be checked. No firearms, edged weapons, or other prohibited items will be allowed inside the building please secure these in your vehicle prior to entry.

To comply with fire code requirements, the Cook-Wilkinson Community Government Room is limited to 85 people, with an overflow area in the Town Hall lobby accommodating an additional 20 individuals. These limits are set by the Denton County Fire Marshal and will be strictly enforced.  As a reminder all meetings will be broadcast LIVE on the Double Oak YouTube channel, so if you are unable to attend in person you can attend via the web.

All meetings will begin promptly at their scheduled starting times. If entering after a meeting has begun, please do so quietly to avoid disrupting the proceedings.

We appreciate the public’s continued support and cooperation as we work together to maintain the safety, civility, and accessibility of our town’s democratic processes.

### 

### Planning and Zoning and Board of Adjustment Open Positions

Three positions (alternate) are open on the BOA, and two (alternate) are open on the P&Z Commission. Applications may be emailed or brought to Town Hall: [lynn.jones@doubleoak.texas.gov](mailto:lynn.jones@doubleoak.texas.gov)
