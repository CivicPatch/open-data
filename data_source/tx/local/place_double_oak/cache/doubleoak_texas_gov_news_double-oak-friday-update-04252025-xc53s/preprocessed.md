The Double Oak Police Department has filled 2 of the full-time patrol officer vacancies. We'd like to welcome both Officer Reed Williams and Officer Edward Coronado to the department, and look forward to seeing their positive influence in our community.

The upcoming Saturday, May 3rd, 2025, General and Special Elections will be held at Double Oak Town Hall between 7am - 7pm. For more information on the election visit the Denton County Election's website at
<https://www.votedenton.gov/>
.

In February of 2025, the Town of Double Oak published the 2025-2029 Stormwater Management Program prepared by the town's engineering firm, Halff Associates, on our
page. This regulatory framework is essential for managing stormwater discharges from the Town’s Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) and aims to reduce pollutant levels to protect local water quality. The town provides this document to promote transparency in the program, meet state standards, and educate our community on what it entails. Town events that help us maintain these standards include the Christmas Tree Dumpsters, Hazardous Waste Events and open communication with our elected officials at Town Council Meetings with any concerns or questions that could be addressed. We rely on our community to keep us informed of their observations and report any problems they might observe around their neighborhoods.

We thank every citizen for taking the time to maintain their yard, utilize our town events, and ensuring their septic system is functioning properly.

Development Status: As of March 2025, Eden Ranch is progressing through the Town of Flower Mound's approval process.

Discussions are ongoing to address these considerations and refine the development plans accordingly.
