Friday Update (November 26, 2025)
=================================

Nov 26

**Due to the Thanksgiving Holiday the Friday Update is being sent out early this week. Reminder that Town Hall will be closed Thursday November 27th and Friday November 28th, 2025.**

**Annual Double Oak Tree Lighting will be before the Town Council meeting on December 1, 2025, followed by Town Council Meeting**

**Town Council Meeting will be on December 1st, 2025, at the Town Hall**

**Town Council Meeting will be on December 15th, 2025, at the Town Hall**

**Double Oak Turkey Trot - November 27, 2025**

**Double Oak Trash Pick Up – Thanksgiving Holiday Week Moved to Saturday**

The normal Friday pickup for our trash and recyclables will take place next Saturday. This will also occur during Christmas and New Years. We will provide updates on those holidays as they get closer. So remember trash cans out on Friday night instead of Thursday for next week.

**Double Oak Town Council Vacancy**

The Town of Double Oak is accepting applications from residents interested in being considered to fill the vacant Town Council position created by the resignation of Councilmember Janet Robertson.

To be eligible, applicants must have lived in Double Oak for at least 12 months and be willing to serve for the remainder of the unexpired term. Interested residents may obtain the application form directly from the Town Administrator, and all applications must be received, at Town Hall, by Friday, December 5th at 3:00 p.m. to be considered.

While citizens may submit an application to express their interest, it is important to note that councilmembers make all nominations, and submitting an application does not guarantee a nomination. During the appointment meeting, councilmembers may each nominate one eligible citizen, and once nominations are closed, the Council will vote on each nominee in the order they were nominated. A majority vote of the councilmembers present is required to fill the vacancy, and once a nominee receives that majority, the process concludes and the appointee will be immediately sworn into office. The Town encourages qualified, service-minded residents to apply and take part in this important civic opportunity.

**Double Oak Turkey Trot – Thanksgiving Day November 27, 2025**

The Double Oak 15th Annual Turkey Trot will take place on Thursday, November 27th. It will bring the community together for a fun and festive morning of fitness and celebration. Participants of all ages will enjoy the scenic course through the heart of Double Oak.

Thanksgiving Day, Thursday, November 27,2025

Double Oak Town Hall
320 Waketon Road
Double Oak, TX 75077

**The Town parked the Speed Trailer for 30 days on Kings Road to gain a statistical look at how many cars and trucks use Kings Road on a 30-day basis.**
