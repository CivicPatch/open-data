Friday Update - December 26, 2025
=================================

Dec 26

Written By [Laura Meilinger](https://doubleoak.texas.gov/news?author=689a07883f7483535dcc6974)

**Upcoming Double Oak Public Meeting Dates**

**Town Hall will be closed on Wednesday December 31st and Thursday January 1st for the New Year Holiday**

**Town Council Meeting will be on January 5th, 2026, at the Town Hall**

**Reflections on 2025: A Year of Steady Progress in Double Oak**

Message from the Mayor

As we come to the close of 2025, it is a good time to reflect on the year behind us. It was a year that required focus, patience, and a great deal of behind-the-scenes work by Town Council, staff, volunteers, and residents who care deeply about Double Oak.

Many of the most meaningful accomplishments of the year were not flashy or headline-grabbing. Instead, they involved improving how the Town operates day to day, strengthening financial oversight, addressing infrastructure needs, and laying the groundwork for long-term stability. I am proud of the progress made and grateful for the professionalism and commitment shown throughout the year.

**A Year Focused on Doing Things the Right Way**

**Strengthening Town Operations**

Throughout 2025, the Town focused on improving internal operations to ensure professionalism, efficiency, and accountability. This included leadership transitions within public safety, updates to all Town job descriptions, and administrative adjustments designed to clarify responsibilities particularly in financial and administrative roles.

Staff schedules were refined to eliminate built-in overtime, and cross-training was emphasized so residents continue to receive consistent service. While much of this work occurs behind the scenes, it is essential to maintaining a stable, well-run organization.

**Sound Financial Management and Transparency**

Financial responsibility remained a top priority. Significant work was completed to clean up historical financial records, improve accounting processes, and correct employee benefits tracking. Regular financial updates were provided to Town Council to support transparency and informed decision-making.

The Town also completed its annual financial audit and took major steps toward modernizing financial systems. Council approved the transition to a new financial ERP system, developed a new chart of accounts, and streamlined the FY 2025–26 budget process to better align with long-term planning goals.

Several financial policies were updated to strengthen internal controls. I would also like to recognize Laura Meilinger and Carol Johnson, whose professional efforts and volunteer support were instrumental in the Town’s financial clean-up and process improvements. Their attention to detail and willingness to step in made a meaningful difference.

**Infrastructure, Public Works, and Permitting**

Maintaining and improving infrastructure remained an important focus in 2025. The Town coordinated mill and overlay street projects to extend roadway life, improve safety, and protect past investments.

Public works and code compliance efforts were strengthened through improved notification and follow-up processes, as well as dedicated support for permitting and inspections. These efforts helped residents and property owners navigate requirements efficiently while maintaining Town standards.

I would like to recognize Steve Koehler and Marshall Koehler for their hard work in Public Works. Their efforts in coordinating infrastructure projects, supporting permitting and inspections, and maintaining Town facilities directly impact the quality of life in our community.

The Town also worked through zoning and infrastructure coordination related to the 250 Simmons property and longer-term planning efforts at FM 407 and Simmons Road, with a continued emphasis on drainage, compatibility, and thoughtful development.

**Technology Improvements and Cost Control**

Another key focus in 2025 was improving efficiency while controlling costs. The Town eliminated duplicative IT contracts, consolidated services, completed server upgrades, and improved protections for critical systems.

Cooperative purchasing agreements were implemented to ensure competitive pricing, and the Town completed a website upgrade with a new vendor improving communication while reducing ongoing costs. Together, these efforts reflect a practical approach to responsible resource management.

**Customer Service and Public Engagement**

Double Oak remained committed to open government and responsive customer service. Town Hall hours were adjusted to better meet residents’ needs, and internal record-keeping systems were improved for accuracy and accessibility.

The Town managed a high volume of public information and open records requests in 2025. Improved organization and tracking helped ensure timely and thorough responses. Town

Council meeting processes were also refined, with clearer agendas and more consistent staff reports.

**Community and Regional Collaboration**

Beyond Town Hall, the Town continued to engage with community organizations and regional partners. Regular communication with neighboring municipalities, regional associations, utility providers, and county officials supported coordination on shared challenges and opportunities.

These relationships remain important as Double Oak plans for the future.

**Appreciation for Dedicated Service**

A year like 2025 does not move forward without dedicated people willing to serve often quietly and without expectation of recognition. I would like to thank Town Administrator Chris Laugenour, Lynn Jones, Laura Meilinger, and Police Chief Dan Miller for their professionalism, leadership, and commitment to the residents of Double Oak.

I would also like to thank the members of the Double Oak Town Council, as well as those who serve on the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Board of Adjustment. These volunteer roles require significant time and thoughtful consideration, and their service plays a critical role in shaping the future of our town.

My appreciation also extends to the men and women of the Double Oak Police Department, whose dedication to public safety is essential to our community. Thanks to focused recruitment efforts and several new hires this year, the department is now fully staffed for the first time in more than five years, improving public safety, officer wellness, and long-term retention.

Finally, I extend sincere thanks to the Double Oak Volunteer Fire Department. Our volunteer firefighters balance careers, family responsibilities, and rigorous training while serving this community. Their dedication reflects the very best of public service.

**Looking Ahead**

As we move into 2026, Double Oak is well positioned to build on the progress of the past year. Key priorities include overseeing future commercial development, completing the financial system conversion, reviewing municipal ordinances, and continuing to identify efficiencies that protect taxpayer resources.

**Closing Message from the Mayor**

Double Oak remains a town that values careful planning, responsible decision-making, and respectful dialogue. We accomplished all of this without increasing the property tax rate, while continuing to maintain one of the lowest property tax rates in Denton County. We look forward to building on this success together in the year ahead.

Thank you for your continued engagement and commitment to our community.

Sincerely,

Patrick Johnson

Mayor of Double Oak

We wish everyone a safe and wonderful weekend.
