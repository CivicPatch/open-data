Double Oak - Friday Update 09/05/25
===================================

Sep 5

Written By [Laura Meilinger](https://doubleoak.texas.gov/news?author=689a07883f7483535dcc6974)

### Double Oak - Friday Update (09/05/2025)

#### Upcoming Double Oak Public Meeting Dates

* **Town Council Meeting** on Monday September 15th at 7pm at the Town Hall

#### Upcoming Events in Double Oak

#### Ordinance Committee Update: Exploring Governance Improvements

The Ordinance Review Committee recently met to discuss a range of topics aimed at modernizing and improving the Town’s operations and ordinances. Key items included:

**Town Council Meetings:** The committee is exploring the potential benefits of moving to one regular meeting per month, which could reduce costs and align with practices in similar-sized towns. Flexibility for additional meetings when needed and clearer agenda posting timelines were also discussed.

**Term Limits:** There was strong support for implementing term limits for Mayor and Council members. A working proposal suggests two consecutive terms, with a required break before returning to service, and a maximum of 12 total years in either role.

**Ordinance Compliance:** The committee is reviewing several existing ordinances for alignment with Texas state law, including those related to building materials, pool enclosures, substandard buildings, rabies control, and penalty limits. Given the scope of this effort, the Town is also exploring third-party support partnering with an external group that works with municipalities to review and provide recommendations on ordinance compliance and modernization.

**Emerging Priorities:** Additional topics under review include regulations for drones and aerial vehicles, short-term rental properties (Airbnb), and noise ordinances, especially as the region prepares for increased tourism ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

**Future Topics:** Other pending items for review include regulations related to sprinklers, culverts, garage placement, fencing, and signage.

The Committee continues its work with a focus on transparency, legal alignment, and long-term effectiveness for Double Oak residents. Stay tuned for future updates and opportunities to provide input.

#### Double Oak Volunteer Fire Department (DOVFD) Monthly Summary for August 2025

In August 2025, the Double Oak Volunteer Fire Department responded to a total of 148 calls, with 51 fire-related incidents (34%) and 97 medical emergencies (66%). The department remained highly active in training and service, logging 1,827 training hours and over 4,000 volunteer hours, not including time spent on calls or training. Notably, Lexi Goodwin, a Double Oak resident, achieved her EMT certification, marking an important milestone in her service journey. In addition, Lexi, along with Ben McClain and Lt. Craig Apfel, represented the department on an All-Hazard Deployment to Kerrville, where they assisted with search and rescue/recovery operations. The department also received a generous show of support from the Double Oak Women’s Club, who prepared and delivered a heartfelt dinner to the station, further strengthening the bond between the community and its first responders. The DOVFD continues to uphold its mission through professionalism, ongoing training, and dedicated volunteer service.

#### Property Update: FM 407 and Simmons Road

As of 9/5/2025 No Additional Information on this property has been shared with Town Hall.

The property at the corner of FM 407 and Simmons Road has long been identified as one of the last available parcels in Double Oak for retail or mixed-use development. The land has been listed for sale for many years, and recently the Town was notified by the property’s realtor that a potential contract is now pending.

Over the past three years, several developers have informally inquired about this site, but this is the first indication of a pending sale. If a developer moves forward, the project must follow the Town’s established ordinance-driven process before anything can be approved.

The town will continue to provide updates as information becomes available.

#### Double Oak Police Speed Tracker Trailer Statistics

Speed Tracker Results will now be provided on the eCode360 website at the link below with the latest results. The trailer will stay at specific locations for extended periods as we continue to analyze the data to assist in staffing our patrol hours at different locations.

**Speed Trailer Results – 521 Waketon Rd (Eastbound)**

**Survey Dates: August 21-September 4, 2025**

The Double Oak Police Department recently deployed the speed trailer on Waketon Road at 521 to monitor vehicle speeds in both directions. The posted speed limit in this area is 30 mph.

Traffic Direction Measured: Eastbound (closing) and Westbound (away)

**Total Vehicles Recorded: 89,147**

• Westbound: 48,396

• Eastbound: 40,751

**Key Findings**

**Category** **Eastbound (Closing)** **Westbound (Away)** **Combined Total**

Vehicles Under Limit (≤30 mph) 12,549 (30.79%) 14,237 (29.42%) 26,786 (30.05%)

Vehicles Over Limit (>30 mph) 28,202 (69.21%) 34,159 (70.58%) 62,361 (69.95%)

Excessive Speed (>40 mph) 500 (1.23%) 2,233 (4.61%) 2,733 (3.07%)

**Speed Metrics**

• Average Speed (Combined): 32.35 mph

o Eastbound: 32.05 mph

o Westbound: 32.61 mph

• Average Speed of Violators: 34.18 mph

• 85th Percentile Speed (Free Flow): 36 mph

• Most Common Speed Range ("Pace"): 28–37 mph

• Standard Deviation: 4 mph (combined)

• Maximum Recorded Speed: 105 mph

• Minimum Recorded Speed: 7 mph

**Notable Time-Based Observations**

• Highest Traffic Volume Hour: 3:00 PM – 3:59 PM with 7,133 vehicles

• Time with Most Excessive Speeders: Afternoon hours (2:00–5:00 PM), particularly westbound

• Very Late-Night Traffic: Minimal, but some high-speed violations recorded (e.g., 76–85+ mph during late hours)

**Key Takeaways**

• Nearly 70% of all drivers exceeded the 30-mph speed limit.

• Over 3% (2,733 drivers) were traveling at excessive speeds above 40 mph—a serious enforcement concern.

• Westbound traffic exhibited higher speeding rates and a larger number of excessive speeders than eastbound traffic.

• Speeding is consistent throughout the day, peaking during commute hours and early afternoon.

• Maximum speeds recorded (up to 105 mph) are alarmingly high for a residential/commercial area, warranting focused enforcement and potential public safety communication.

**Summary**

During the two-week speed survey at 521 Waketon Rd, a total of 89,147 vehicles were recorded—40,751 traveling eastbound and 48,396 westbound. The posted speed limit is 30 mph, but 70% of drivers exceeded that limit, with over 2,700 vehicles (3.07%) clocked at excessive speeds above 40 mph.

• Average speed across both directions was 32.35 mph, with the 85th percentile speed at 36 mph.

• Westbound traffic was more problematic, with 4.61% of drivers exceeding 40 mph, compared to 1.23% eastbound.

• The fastest recorded speed was 105 mph, a significant safety concern.

• Speeding occurred consistently throughout the day, peaking during afternoon hours (2–5 PM), when the highest volumes and speeds were observed.

This data highlights a persistent speeding issue along Waketon Rd, especially in the westbound direction during peak afternoon traffic. Enforcement and community education may be warranted to improve compliance and safety in this corridor.

#### Reminders:

#### New Safety Measures for Double Oak Public Meetings

In response to rising safety concerns at public meetings across the country, the Town of Double Oak is implementing enhanced procedures to ensure a secure and respectful environment for all attendees. While Double Oak remains a close-knit and civically engaged community, recent discussions such as those surrounding a proposed helistop have drawn heightened attention and commentary on social media platforms like Facebook. As community participation grows, so does the importance of maintaining safe and orderly public forums.

Under the direction of Police Chief Daniel Miller, and in consultation with the Denton County Fire Marshal, new safety protocols will now be in place for all public meetings held at Town Hall. These include Town Council, Planning & Zoning Commission, Board of Adjustments, and any special-called meetings. Attendees will pass through a metal detector screening, and all bags will be checked. No firearms, edged weapons, or other prohibited items will be allowed inside the building please secure these in your vehicle prior to entry.

To comply with fire code requirements, the Cook-Wilkinson Community Government Room is limited to 85 people, with an overflow area in the Town Hall lobby accommodating an additional 20 individuals. These limits are set by the Denton County Fire Marshal and will be strictly enforced. As a reminder all meetings will be broadcast LIVE on the Double Oak YouTube channel, so if you are unable to attend in person you can attend via the web.

All meetings will begin promptly at their scheduled starting times. If entering after a meeting has begun, please do so quietly to avoid disrupting the proceedings.

We appreciate the public’s continued support and cooperation as we work together to maintain the safety, civility, and accessibility of our town’s democratic processes.
