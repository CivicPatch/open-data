Double Oak - Friday Update (07/25/2025)
=======================================

Jul 25

Written By [Alec Williams](https://doubleoak.texas.gov/news?author=5ebc77728a89f76b2426ccd8)

**Why Process and Planning Matter in Double Oak**
-------------------------------------------------

As we move through this year’s budget season, Double Oak is facing decisions and developments that highlight why responsible local governance matters now more than ever.

The helistop application at 250 Simmons Road is currently moving through our formal zoning process, with a public hearing set for August 7 and final Town Council consideration on August 18. Regardless of where residents stand on the issue, I want to emphasize one thing: we are following the rules. Every step notification, public input, review, and decision-making is being handled lawfully and transparently. This is how small-town government should work.

That’s especially important given what’s happening at the state level. Texas lawmakers continue to push for broader control over local land use, with laws like House Bill 2127 threatening to strip away municipal authority on zoning, development, and more. The more we deviate from local due process, the more we give weight to the argument that towns can’t manage these decisions responsibly. That’s why it’s essential we hold the line not just on this issue, but on how we govern.

At the same time, Double Oak is being affected by growth just outside our borders. The Eden Ranch development in Flower Mound will increase cut-through traffic through our town, impacting roads and safety. We must plan now through our budget for the long-term effects of regional growth we can’t control.

As we finalize the town’s budget in August and September, we’re focused on protecting Double Oak’s values: local control, safe infrastructure, and thoughtful growth. That may include legal resources, traffic enforcement, and community outreach.

Please stay engaged. Attend the helistop hearing, follow the budget process, and watch Eden Ranch developments. Local government only works when residents are informed and involved and this year, your voice truly matters.

**FM 407 and Vickery Boulevard Traffic Signals – Impacts on Double Oak**
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A new traffic signal at FM 407 and Vickery Boulevard in Copper Canyon is expected to be installed and operational by end of July or early August, according to updates from the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). Signal pole foundations have already been placed, and the project remains on track to help address growing traffic volumes along this busy stretch of road.

Town officials and TxDOT have coordinated efforts to improve safety and manage congestion at this increasingly busy intersection. The signal is intended to create a safer, more efficient flow for vehicles turning onto FM 407 from Vickery, particularly during peak hours.

In the meantime, eastbound backups at the Vickery intersection may lead some drivers to cut through Double Oak neighborhoods, using alternate routes such as Tanglewood Drive and Cedar Crest Road. Residents in those areas could experience increased traffic until the new signal is activated.

The town encourages drivers to remain patient and mindful of neighborhood streets as TxDOT moves toward completing this project. The Double Oak Police Department will monitor the potential traffic increase once the signals are activated.

**Double Oak Police Speed Tracker Trailer Statistics**
------------------------------------------------------

Speed Tracker Results will now be provided on the eCode360 website at the link below with the latest results. The trailer will stay at specific locations for extended periods as we continue to analyze the data to assist in staffing our patrol hours at different locations.

### **Speed Trailer Survey at 240 Timberleaf Dr (Westbound), July 17–24, 2025**

The Double Oak Police Department conducted a speed survey from July 17 to July 24, 2025, at 240 Timberleaf Drive, capturing traffic in both westbound and eastbound directions. The results reflect a relatively balanced flow of vehicles, with 1,565 total vehicles recorded 791 heading west and 774 heading east.

**Key Findings**

**Overall compliance:**

* 79.94% (1,251 vehicles) were driving at or below the speed limit.
* 20.06% (314 vehicles) exceeded the posted speed limit.

**Excessive Speeding (≥40 mph):**

* Only 2 vehicles (0.13%) were recorded over 40 mph.

**Highest speed recorded: 49 mph (eastbound).**

* No excessive speeds noted westbound.

**Average Speeds:**

* Westbound: 27.19 mph
* Eastbound: 26.76 mph
* Combined average: 26.98 mph
* 85th Percentile Speed: 31 mph
* (meaning 85% of vehicles were traveling at or below this speed)
* Most common speed range ("pace"): 22–31 mph
* In-pace vehicles: 1,085 (69.3% of total traffic)

**Traffic Volume by Time of Day**

* Heaviest traffic periods occurred between 8:00 AM and 2:00 PM, with the 10:00 AM hour recording the highest volume (152 vehicles).
* Late evening and overnight hours showed significantly lower traffic volumes.

**Conclusion**

Traffic along Timberleaf Drive during this one-week period remained mostly within safe limits, with nearly 80% of vehicles driving at or below the posted speed. Only a very small number of drivers exceeded 40 mph, indicating minimal issues with dangerous speeding at this location.

**Understanding the Double Oak Land Use Process**
-------------------------------------------------

A recent zoning request involving a proposed private-use Helistop has drawn increased attention from residents in Double Oak. In the interest of transparency and education, this article outlines the current status of the request, explains how zoning and Specific Use Permit (SUP) matters are handled in Double Oak, and provides important context about how local government functions in these situations.

### **The Zoning and SUP Process: How It Works**

Any request to change the use of land in Double Oak whether it's a rezoning or a request for a Specific Use Permit must follow a legally required multi-step process:

### **Formal Application**

The process begins when an applicant submits a zoning change or SUP request, including required documents such as a site plan, legal description, and applicable fees.

### **Public Notification**

The Town mails notice to property owners within 200 feet and posts official notice at Town Hall and online at least 10 days before the first public hearing.

### **Planning & Zoning Commission Hearing**

A public hearing is held by the Planning & Zoning Commission, during which residents can share feedback. The Commission then votes to recommend approval, denial, or modifications.

### **Town Council Hearing**

A second public hearing is held by the Town Council. The Council considers the P&Z recommendation and public input before voting.

### **Ordinance Adoption**

If approved, an ordinance is adopted to formalize the zoning change or SUP.

This process is required by law and ensures that all zoning matters are handled consistently, fairly, and with public input.

Until the replat was submitted, the Town was not authorized to begin the formal zoning process. Once received, the Town Administrator followed all required procedures for notification and scheduling.

### **Informal Conversations Are Not Official Actions**

It is common for the Mayor, Council Members, or Town Staff to have conversations with residents, developers, or outside parties exploring future ideas or proposals. These interactions are routine and happen in every town.

However, unless and until a formal application is submitted, such conversations are purely informal, are not part of any official process, and are not subject to public disclosure. They carry no authority and should not be interpreted as signaling support, opposition, or direction by the Town.

### **No Position Taken, Legal Oversight Maintained**

As Mayor, I want to make it clear that I nor any of the Town Council or Planning and Zoning Committee have taken any position on this zoning request and as Mayor I will not attempt to influence the Planning & Zoning Commission or the Town Council. The application will move forward through the appropriate public channels, and all decisions will be made based on the facts, legal standards, and community feedback.

Throughout this process, the Town Attorney has been consulted and continues to provide legal guidance to ensure full compliance with Double Oak’s ordinances and Texas law.

### **Why This Process Matters**

This zoning and SUP procedure exists to ensure:

1. Transparency and Notice – Property owners and neighbors are informed and have the opportunity to participate.
2. Checks and Balances – Two separate public hearings (P&Z and Town Council) provide a thorough and balanced review.
3. Consistency and Fairness – The same process is followed for all applicants, ensuring that no one receives special treatment.
4. Protection of Community Character – Land use decisions reflect thoughtful planning and are grounded in the Town’s long-standing values.

These protections are especially important in a small town like Double Oak, where rural character, open space, and orderly development are key priorities for our residents.

### **Planning and Zoning and Board of Adjustment Open Positions**

Three positions (alternate) are open on the BOA, and two (alternate) are open on the P&Z Commission. Applications may be emailed or brought to Town Hall: [lynn.jones@doubleoak.texas.gov](mailto:lynn.jones@doubleoak.texas.gov)

<https://www.doubleoak.texas.gov/government/boards-commissions>

The town is always looking for new citizens to join us in governing the town.
