#### Town Council Meeting on Monday September 15th at 7pm at the Town Hall

* October 7, 2025
* - Saturday November 8, 2025, Town Hall parking lot
* November 27, 2025

Please mark your calendars and join the Double Oak Women’s Club for our first General Meeting on
**Tuesday, September 16th at 7:00 PM**
at the Double Oak Town Hall.

We have so much to look forward to as we continue our mission: connecting as neighbors, creating joy through shared experiences, and contributing meaningfully to our town of Double Oak through service and support. This year, we’ll continue to offer a wonderful balance of women-focused events, programs for children, adult social gatherings (spouses included!), and meaningful charitable projects.

Double Oak Women’s Club is the perfect way to recharge and find connections – and we know there are so many talented, giving women in our town just waiting to be invited!  So please join us!

There is link on the Town of Double Oak website at the top of the page, then scroll down and click on the link “2026 Membership Application” or fill out the membership form next Tuesday.  The $25 membership fee can be paid via check, cash or Zelle at this upcoming General Meeting.

Here’s another year of friendship, fun, and making a difference together!

Social Media & Small-Town Government: A Powerful Tool with Real Risks
=====================================================================

When used constructively, platforms like Facebook and Nextdoor help keep our residents informed and involved. They’ve rallied neighbors to volunteer, share town updates, and weigh in on important issues. That kind of participation is healthy and necessary for local government to reflect the voices of our citizens.

Lately, we’ve seen an increase in posts that misrepresent facts, stoke outrage, or cross over into personal attacks. That’s more than just unhelpful, it’s harmful. Some elected officials have faced threats to their personal safety, been harassed over decisions made in good faith, or targeted with demands for legal action. These kinds of attacks don’t just take a toll on individuals they discourage good people from running for office in the first place.

Serving on Council or in a mayoral role requires countless unpaid hours, hard decisions, and a willingness to listen and learn. When that work is met with threats whether verbal, written, online, or legal it puts the future of public service in small towns like ours at risk.

Let’s keep Double Oak the kind of place where people want to serve, speak up, and stay involved for all the right reasons.

We collect snack bags and non-perishables at
**Double Oak Town Hall**
on the
each month from
These items are distributed immediately to places like PediPlace when children come in for a medical appointment to have nutritional meals to fill their hungry bellies. There is also a plastic tub in lobby of town hall available during working hours from 8am to 4pm.

**Snack Bag Prep at Home (inserted into paper lunch bag or Ziploc bag) includes:**

* Sweet treat (cookies, fruit chews, teddy grahams)

* Double Oak Town Hall
* Saturday November 8th, 9:00 am to Noon

Property Update: FM 407 and Simmons Road
========================================

As of
No Additional Information on this property has been shared with Town Hall.

The town is currently having discussions with professional Planning Consultants to assist if or when this development could happen.  These are professionals that do this for a living and assist small towns like Double Oak to ensure that new business developments are done correctly.  This information will be brought to Town Council at a future meeting if development would move forward.

*The property at the corner of FM 407 and Simmons Road has long been identified as one of the last available parcels in Double Oak for retail or mixed-use development. The land has been listed for sale for many years, and recently the Town was notified by the property’s realtor that a potential contract is now pending.*

*Over the past three years, several developers have informally inquired about this site, but this is the first indication of a pending sale. If a developer moves forward, the project must follow the Town’s established ordinance-driven process before anything can be approved.*

The town will continue to provide updates as information becomes available.

In response to rising safety concerns at public meetings across the country, the Town of Double Oak is implementing enhanced procedures to ensure a secure and respectful environment for all attendees. While Double Oak remains a close-knit and civically engaged community, recent discussions such as those surrounding a proposed helistop have drawn heightened attention and commentary on social media platforms like Facebook. As community participation grows, so does the importance of maintaining safe and orderly public forums.

Under the direction of Police Chief Daniel Miller, and in consultation with the Denton County Fire Marshal, new safety protocols will now be in place for all public meetings held at Town Hall. These include Town Council, Planning & Zoning Commission, Board of Adjustments, and any special-called meetings. Attendees will pass through a metal detector screening, and all bags will be checked. No firearms, edged weapons, or other prohibited items will be allowed inside the building please secure these in your vehicle prior to entry.

To comply with fire code requirements, the Cook-Wilkinson Community Government Room is limited to 85 people, with an overflow area in the Town Hall lobby accommodating an additional 20 individuals. These limits are set by the Denton County Fire Marshal and will be strictly enforced.  As a reminder all meetings will be broadcast LIVE on the Double Oak YouTube channel, so if you are unable to attend in person you can attend via the web.

We appreciate the public’s continued support and cooperation as we work together to maintain the safety, civility, and accessibility of our town’s democratic processes.
