Please mark your calendars and join the Double Oak Women’s Club for our first General Meeting on **Tuesday, September 16th at 7:00 PM** at the Double Oak Town Hall.

We have so much to look forward to as we continue our mission: connecting as neighbors, creating joy through shared experiences, and contributing meaningfully to our town of Double Oak through service and support.

Here’s another year of friendship, fun, and making a difference together!

Social Media & Small-Town Government: A Powerful Tool with Real Risks
=====================================================================

Double Oak has always been a community where neighbors know each other by name and people feel comfortable sharing their opinions. Whether it’s through conversations at the mailbox or posts on local social media groups, civic engagement is part of who we are.

### The Power of Online Conversation

When used constructively, platforms like Facebook and Nextdoor help keep our residents informed and involved. They’ve rallied neighbors to volunteer, share town updates, and weigh in on important issues. That kind of participation is healthy and necessary for local government to reflect the voices of our citizens.

### But There’s a Line. And Sometimes, It’s Being Crossed.

Lately, we’ve seen an increase in posts that misrepresent facts, stoke outrage, or cross over into personal attacks. That’s more than just unhelpful, it’s harmful. Some elected officials have faced threats to their personal safety, been harassed over decisions made in good faith, or targeted with demands for legal action. These kinds of attacks don’t just take a toll on individuals they discourage good people from running for office in the first place.

Serving on Council or in a mayoral role requires countless unpaid hours, hard decisions, and a willingness to listen and learn. When that work is met with threats whether verbal, written, online, or legal it puts the future of public service in small towns like ours at risk.

### We Can Do Better Together.

Passion and disagreement are part of democracy. But so are respect, accountability, and understanding. We welcome honest criticism and hard questions but those should be shared with facts, civility, and the recognition that everyone involved is trying to serve the greater good.

Let’s keep using social media to connect, not divide. Before posting, ask: Is it true? Is it constructive? Have I checked the facts? And if you’ve got a concern, reach out directly we’re here to talk.

Let’s keep Double Oak the kind of place where people want to serve, speak up, and stay involved for all the right reasons.

Jellybean Food for Kids
=======================

We collect snack bags and non-perishables at **Double Oak Town Hall** on the **1st and 3rd Wednesdays** each month from **9 to 11 a.m.** These items are distributed immediately to places like PediPlace when children come in for a medical appointment to have nutritional meals to fill their hungry bellies. There is also a plastic tub in lobby of town hall available during working hours from 8am to 4pm.

**Snack Bag Prep at Home (inserted into paper lunch bag or Ziploc bag) includes:**

* Drink (water bottle, juice box, or protein drink)
* Fruit (fruit cups, applesauce, or squeezable fruit)
* Protein (mac & cheese cup, protein bar, ramen noodles, meat sticks)
* Snack (goldfish, crackers, popcorn, pretzels, chips)
* Sweet treat (cookies, fruit chews, teddy grahams)
* Optional: Handwritten notes, activity/coloring sheets, crayons

**Other ways to contribute:**

**Group Events:** Make it a social effort! Organize a Snack Bag assembly with your Book club, Bunco group, Walking group or neighborhood event. Ask each person to bring a dozen items and make it a service night with a purpose!

**Volunteer at Collection Events:** Just one hour, once a quarter, can make a big difference. We need more collection volunteers on 1st and 3rd Wednesdays and appreciate your effort to contribute in a meaningful way to the children of our surrounding communities.

For more information, please check out our website at [www.jellybeansfoodforkids.com](http://www.jellybeansfoodforkids.com) or contact Mary Johnson at 972-890-2509.

Property Update: FM 407 and Simmons Road
========================================

As of **9/12/2025** No Additional Information on this property has been shared with Town Hall.

The town is currently having discussions with professional Planning Consultants to assist if or when this development could happen.  These are professionals that do this for a living and assist small towns like Double Oak to ensure that new business developments are done correctly.  This information will be brought to Town Council at a future meeting if development would move forward.

*The property at the corner of FM 407 and Simmons Road has long been identified as one of the last available parcels in Double Oak for retail or mixed-use development. The land has been listed for sale for many years, and recently the Town was notified by the property’s realtor that a potential contract is now pending.*

*Over the past three years, several developers have informally inquired about this site, but this is the first indication of a pending sale. If a developer moves forward, the project must follow the Town’s established ordinance-driven process before anything can be approved.*

The town will continue to provide updates as information becomes available.

Double Oak Police Speed Tracker Trailer Statistics
--------------------------------------------------

Speed Tracker Results will now be provided on the eCode360 website at the link below with the latest results. The trailer will stay at specific locations for extended periods as we continue to analyze the data to assist in staffing our patrol hours at different locations.

**NO REPORT THIS WEEK**

### New Safety Measures for Double Oak Public Meetings

In response to rising safety concerns at public meetings across the country, the Town of Double Oak is implementing enhanced procedures to ensure a secure and respectful environment for all attendees. While Double Oak remains a close-knit and civically engaged community, recent discussions such as those surrounding a proposed helistop have drawn heightened attention and commentary on social media platforms like Facebook. As community participation grows, so does the importance of maintaining safe and orderly public forums.

Under the direction of Police Chief Daniel Miller, and in consultation with the Denton County Fire Marshal, new safety protocols will now be in place for all public meetings held at Town Hall. These include Town Council, Planning & Zoning Commission, Board of Adjustments, and any special-called meetings. Attendees will pass through a metal detector screening, and all bags will be checked. No firearms, edged weapons, or other prohibited items will be allowed inside the building please secure these in your vehicle prior to entry.

To comply with fire code requirements, the Cook-Wilkinson Community Government Room is limited to 85 people, with an overflow area in the Town Hall lobby accommodating an additional 20 individuals. These limits are set by the Denton County Fire Marshal and will be strictly enforced.  As a reminder all meetings will be broadcast LIVE on the Double Oak YouTube channel, so if you are unable to attend in person you can attend via the web.

All meetings will begin promptly at their scheduled starting times. If entering after a meeting has begun, please do so quietly to avoid disrupting the proceedings.

We appreciate the public’s continued support and cooperation as we work together to maintain the safety, civility, and accessibility of our town’s democratic processes.
