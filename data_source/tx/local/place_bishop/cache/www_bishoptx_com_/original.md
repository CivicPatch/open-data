Welcome
=======

Located in the heart of South Texas’ Wild Horse Desert, the city of Bishop has been evolving steadily since its inception over a century ago. Envisioning a model community surrounded by acres of rich farmland, a young insurance salesman named **F.Z. Bishop** first purchased 2,300 acres from the Driscoll Ranch along the newly built St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico railroads. Since then, Bishop has become home to over 3,000 residents, a large agricultural presence and a base of operations for the Dallas-based Celanese Chemicals, Ticona Plastics and BASF Pharmaceuticals. In addition, our strong sense of community, excellent school system and status as a leader in the manufacturing of chemical products and special materials has attracted visitors, residents and entrepreneurs alike.
