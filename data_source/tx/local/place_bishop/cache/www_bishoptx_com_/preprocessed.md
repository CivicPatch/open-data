L
ocated in the heart of South Texas’ Wild Horse Desert, the city of Bishop has been evolving steadily since its inception over a century ago. Envisioning a model community surrounded by acres of rich farmland, a young insurance salesman named
**F.Z. Bishop**
first purchased 2,300 acres from the Driscoll Ranch along the newly built St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico railroads. Since then, Bishop has become home to over 3,000 residents, a large agricultural presence and a base of operations for the Dallas-based Celanese Chemicals, Ticona Plastics and BASF Pharmaceuticals. In addition, our strong sense of community, excellent school system and status as a leader in the manufacturing of chemical products and special materials has attracted visitors, residents and entrepreneurs alike.

While we already know what makes our city so special, here are a few points you should know about Bishop:

From exploring the 100’s of miles of pristine beaches just a short drive away or taking a weekend jaunt to the Texas Hill Country or Mexico, Bishop is centrally located to some of Texas’ most popular tourist attractions.

We love our city and are proud of it. Whether we are cheering on the Bishop Badgers on a Friday night, worshiping at one of our many churches or taking the family out to the city park, we understand that Bishop is more than just a town. It’s a community of friends and neighbors who support each other and grow with each generation.
