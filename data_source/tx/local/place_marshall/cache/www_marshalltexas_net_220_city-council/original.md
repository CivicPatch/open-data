[Texas Government Code, Sec. 551.007](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/GV/htm/GV.551.htm) requires that a governmental body must allow each member of the public who desires to address the body regarding an item on the agenda the opportunity to do so before or during the body's consideration of the item. The “Citizen Comments” portion of the meeting meets the requirements of this law and is the public’s opportunity to speak on any item on the agenda.

* Fill out and submit an [online public comment form](https://www.marshalltexas.net/536/Public-Comment-Request) or [complete a public comment form](https://www.marshalltexas.net/DocumentCenter/View/3083) and submit prior to the time the City Council meeting is scheduled to begin up to the time the Citizen Comments portion has concluded.  Forms are also available at the meeting.
* Allot three (3) minutes to address the City Council unless additional time has been requested by [the City Secretary](https://www.marshalltexas.net/166/City-Secretary)..

To speak about an issue or concern not on the City Council agenda:
