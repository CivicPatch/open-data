Mayor & City Council
====================

The City of Sweetwater is a home-rule city, operating under the authority of a City Charter adopted in 1956. Our City Council serves as the city's governing body, providing leadership and guidance on policies that shape our community.

In 1985, the Council initiated a two-part plan to implement single-member voting districts, which was fully adopted in 1986. This structure ensures that each area of Sweetwater is fairly represented
