Terrance Johnson is a Dallas, Texas, native and alumnus of Woodrow Wilson High School. He began his higher education at Texas A&M University–Commerce in 2004, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a minor in English. This academic foundation continues to inform his approach to leadership, communication, and public service.

In 2013, Mr. Johnson relocated to Collin County to help launch a faith-based youth organization focused on mentorship, character development, and community engagement. Through this work, he cultivated strong partnerships among families, volunteers, and local stakeholders and emerged as a trusted leader committed to creating opportunities for young people and strengthening civic collaboration.

Mr. Johnson is also a graduate of the Leadership McKinney Class of 2023, a flagship civic leadership program of the McKinney Chamber of Commerce that prepares emerging leaders to address regional challenges through informed, collaborative governance.

He is married to Yasma Johnson, a fellow Texas A&M University–Commerce alumna, and together they are raising two daughters who attend Princeton ISD schools. As a husband, father, and public servant, Mr. Johnson remains deeply invested in policies and decisions that enhance the quality of life, educational opportunity, and long-term prosperity for Princeton families.
