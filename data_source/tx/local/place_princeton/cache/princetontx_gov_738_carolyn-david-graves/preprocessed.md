Carolyn David-Graves grew up in the Caribbean and lived in several states before moving to Texas in 2015. Several years ago, she and her family started searching for a home in the surrounding cities and chose to establish their home in Princeton. After relocating, she committed herself to actively contributing to the overall growth and prosperity of Princeton. Among available options, she decided to serve Princeton by becoming a member of the City Council where she feels she would make the most impactful and positive difference.

Carolyn’s vision is to build Princeton into a thriving city where residents love to call home and visitors want to return. She plans to do so by helping remove obstacles to growth with a commitment to integrity, open collaboration, mutual respect, and trust. Through her role on the City Council, Carolyn aspires to be a driving force in making this vision a reality for Princeton.
