Cristina Todd made Princeton her home in 2016, along with her husband, Jake, and their four-legged loved ones; "the pups," Leo and Zoey, and "feline co-owners," Binx and Remington.

Cristina's lifelong commitment to community service and engagement was fostered by Rotary's principle of "Service Above Self." She has been actively involved with Rotary for over 20 years. She remains an impassioned advocate for this principle, both in her independent service for her neighbors and fellow Princetonians and in her continued leadership in Rotary in her third term as Assistant Governor of District 5810.

With nearly two decades of experience in Special Education, she continues to be valued for her devotion to leadership roles in Special Education for PISD, where she shapes inclusive and enriching environments for her students and colleagues to thrive.

Cristina has made it her mission to bring her passion for service to the City's leadership, foster transparency and accountability, strengthen the bonds between residents and neighbors, and increase their confidence that they are heard.
