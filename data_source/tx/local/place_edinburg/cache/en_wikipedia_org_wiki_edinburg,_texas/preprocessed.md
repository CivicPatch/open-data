(
) is a city in and the
[county seat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_seat "County seat")
of
Hidalgo County
,
Texas
, United States.
The population was 100,243 at the
[2020 census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_census "2020 United States census")
,
and in 2022, its estimated population was 104,294,
making it the second-largest city in Hidalgo County, and the third-largest city in the larger
Rio Grande Valley
region.

In 1908, John Closner, William Briggs, Argyle McAllen, Plutarco de la Viña, and Dennis B. Chapin began to develop a new community at this site. The town square was located at the current crossroads of
U.S. Highway 281
and
State Highway 107
. The town was named "Chapin" in honor of one of the developers. A local myth relates that Edinburg became the county seat of Hidalgo County in a dramatic, nighttime covert operation in which the county records were removed from the previous county seat. However, historical records show more practical reasons. The 1886 Hidalgo County Courthouse in the city of
Hidalgo
was under frequent danger of flooding because it stood just a few yards away from the banks of the
Rio Grande
. Additionally, the county was over 80 miles (130 km) long at this time, and state law required that the courthouse be close to the geographic center of a county.
A wood-frame courthouse was designed and built beside the Chapin courthouse square in 1908; construction on a grand courthouse within the square began in 1910 under the supervision of San Antonio builders and a partnership of San Antonio architects.
When Dennis Chapin was involved in the shooting death of Oscar J. Rountree at the Dan Breen Saloon in
San Antonio
,
the community changed its name to "Edinburg" to honor John Young, a prominent businessman who was born in
Edinburgh
,
Scotland
. The town was officially renamed in 1911 and incorporated in 1919. As they grew in the 1920's in popularity the city of Edinburg was called "Gateway to the Valley" by many to attract tourists.

In 2013, the city council voted to annex about 2,000 acres (810 ha) of area into the city limits.

Edinburg is located in south-central Hidalgo County at
