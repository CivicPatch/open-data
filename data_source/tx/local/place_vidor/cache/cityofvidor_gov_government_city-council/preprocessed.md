The City Council is dedicated to serving our community by shaping policies that promote growth, safety, and well-being for all residents. As your elected representatives, we work collaboratively to address key issues and create a sustainable future for our city.

The City Council consists of council members elected from various districts across the city, each bringing a unique perspective and focus on the needs of their respective wards. Together, we guide the direction of city government, pass ordinances, adopt budgets, and ensure that public resources are used responsibly.

This page is your resource to stay informed about the council’s activities. Here, you can find meeting agendas, minutes, and information on upcoming sessions, as well as details on how to participate in public hearings or share your concerns with your council member. We believe that active community involvement is key to effective governance, and we encourage you to engage with us on issues that matter to you.
