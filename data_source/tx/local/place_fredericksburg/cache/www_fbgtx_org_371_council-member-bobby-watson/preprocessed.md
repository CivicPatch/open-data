Councilmember Bobby Watson
==========================

After graduating from the University of Texas in Arlington, Bobby Watson joined his family business, Watson Food Service, and continued to work for the business for eight years after the business was sold in 1998. Living in Addison, Texas, he served on civic boards and in 1998 was elected to the Addison City Council.

After Watson joined Miller and Associates, a manufacturer's representative firm, he moved to Fredericksburg in 2000. It was important to be involved in the community. He joined the Chamber of Commerce and served as Leadership Class President in 2008.

Watson served on the Boys and Girls Club Board, Wayfinding Committee, and was Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce in 2012.  He served on the board of the Texas Center for Wine and Culinary Arts (now FlavoryTX) and served on the Planning and Zoning Commission.

In 2018, Watson was appointed to the Fredericksburg Historic Review Board and rejoined the Texas Center for Wine and Culinary Arts Board as a director.  He also retired from Miller & Associates in 2018 after a 43-year career in the foodservice industry.

Watson brings the experience of a successful businessman and proven community leadership to the Council. He previously served on the Fredericksburg City Council from 2016-18 and from 2019-present.
