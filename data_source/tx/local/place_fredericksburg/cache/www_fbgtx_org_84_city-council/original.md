**Additional Information**
--------------------------

### **Member Selection & Terms**

As per the Home Rule Charter, adopted by the citizens of Fredericksburg in 1991, the legislative and governing body of the City of Fredericksburg consists of a mayor and four council members. They are elected from the city at large. The term for the mayor and council members is two years. No mayor or council member may serve more than four consecutive two-year terms in the same office. The terms of the council members are staggered so that two members are elected to a regular term each year.

### **Requirements**

Each member of the City Council must be a resident citizen of the City of Fredericksburg and have been so for a period of not less than 12 months immediately preceding his/her election. Each member must also be a qualified voter of the State of Texas and shall not be indebted to the City of Fredericksburg.

### **Sessions**

Closed/executive sessions may be called by the mayor or by two or more council members for any purpose specifically authorized by state law. Any allowed subject matter deliberated in the closed/executive session will be voted on once the council reconvenes into the public session of the council meeting.

### **Additional Meetings**

Special meetings may be held on the call of the mayor or two council members and whenever practicable, and written public notice thereof must be given as required by the Statutes of the State of Texas.

### **Meeting Requirements**

State law prescribes several specific requirements for council meetings:

* A quorum, three members of the council, be present for the transaction of business
* Any question before the council is decided by a majority vote of the members present and voting, except where the law requires more than a simple majority.
* The mayor always presides, if present.
* Every meeting of the City Council must be conducted in accordance with Chapter 551 of the Government Code, the Texas Open Meetings Act. Elements of requirements include written notice of the date, hour, and location of every Council meeting, together with an agenda specifically describing all of the items to be considered, be posted three business days in advance of such meeting on a bulletin board in City Hall accessible to the public day and night. The Open Meetings Act provides a few exceptions, such as emergency or urgent public necessity and closed / executive session purposes.
