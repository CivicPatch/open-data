### Elected Mayor: May 2024

### Current Term Expires: May 2027

### 

Kristen J. Ishihara has been a practicing attorney in Longview, Texas since 2006.

She graduated from Baylor Law School with honors and lives in Longview with her husband Richard and two children, Lucas & Brianna.

Kristen was elected to the Longview City Council as a representative for District Four in 2014.

She is a past President of the Junior League of Longview, the Zonta Club of Longview and the Gregg County Bar Association. She is a founding member of the East Texas Alzheimer’s Alliance, Longview PAWS, the Longview Community Foundation and the Greater Longview Estate Planning Council.

Kristen also has the following certifications and accreditations:

* Board Certified in Estate Planning & Probate Law by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization
* Certified as an Elder Law Attorney by the National Elder Law Foundation
* Accredited Estate Planner by the National Association of Estate Planners & Councils

The Mayor presides at council meetings, serves as spokesperson for the community and facilitates communication and understanding between elected and appointed officials. The Mayor also assists the council in setting goals and in advocating policy decisions, and serves as a key representative in intergovernmental relations. Along with the City Council, the Mayor is responsible for soliciting citizen views to form policies and interpret them to the public. The Mayor is elected at large, meaning all Longview citizens have an opportunity to vote for the candidate of choice. Longview utilizes the council-manager form of government, and the Mayor is a volunteer position that does not have day-to-day administrative duties.
