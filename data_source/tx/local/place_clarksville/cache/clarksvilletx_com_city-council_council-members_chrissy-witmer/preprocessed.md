Chrissy Witmer

My name is Chrissy Witmer and I have been on the City Council since 2006.

I have really enjoyed serving the city trying to help assist in making Clarksville a wonderful place to live. I strive to help bring things and be involved in activities in Clarksville.

I am on the Chamber of Commerce board and I like to see new businesses come to Clarksville. One new event that was created while I have been on the Chamber is the Red River Chamber of Commerce Hog Hunt which started in March of 2010. This year the annual hunt was renamed , The Wade Witmer Memorial Hog Hunt, in memory of my son who was killed in a car wreck in July 2011. This year’s event was very special to me.

I also am on the committee of the Women in the Outdoors, which is a HUGE event that has been in Red River County since May 2006. It is an annual event for just women and it is probably one of the largest events in the county. We have all different type of classes for women to experience in the outdoors such as, Skeet Shooting, Archery, Rifle shooting, Dutch Oven Cooking, Duct Tape Purses, just to name a few. I enjoy this event and we have 200 participants and everyone just has a great time.

I also work at the Annual Stew Cook Off taking care of the judging part and also during the lunch where we sell fish to all that are there. I have participated in helping with the Christmas parade last year too. I enjoy being involved with these committees and I agree to volunteer where I am needed.







The City of Clarksville is giving notice of the City’s intent to submit a Texas Community Development Block Grant Program grant application for a Community Development Fund grant request of $350,000 for reconstruction and drainage improvements for portions of North Pecan Street and South Delaware Street in the City of Clarksville. The application is available for review at Clarksville City Hall during regular business hours.
