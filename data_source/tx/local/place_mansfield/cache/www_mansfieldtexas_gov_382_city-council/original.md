Form of Government
------------------

The City of Mansfield runs a Council-Manager form of government. Each member of the Council, including the Mayor, is [elected](https://www.mansfieldtexas.gov/185/Elections-Voting) at large to serve three-year terms. There are no council districts in Mansfield, but rather each member represents the city as a whole.

Council members are expected to attend regular City Council meetings and to serve as liaisons to various advisory committees. Each Council member has an equal vote on all action taken by the Council. There are seven positions (six council members and one mayor) to ensure every issue taken before the Council is granted a decision. There are no tie votes.

### Mayor
