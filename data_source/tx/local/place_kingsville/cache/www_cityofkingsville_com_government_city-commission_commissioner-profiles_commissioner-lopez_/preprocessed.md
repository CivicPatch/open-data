Thank you for the opportunity to serve as your City Commissioner.  Kingsville has been my home for numerous years, and it gives me great pleasure to give back to our community through public service. I was elected City of Kingsville Commissioner in 2016 to Present, and elected Mayor Pro-tem from 2016 to 2020.

I was employed with the City of Kingsville from 1980 until retirement in 2012 and held the position of Kingsville City Secretary for the last nine (9) years of my employment.  As City Secretary, I served as the Chief Election Official responsible for all municipal elections.  My 32-year tenure as a City of Kingsville employee has provided me with an abundance of experience and knowledge of City Government and helps me work positively with and for the Citizens of the City of Kingsville and Kleberg County. I was the first City Secretary for the City of Kingsville to receive the designation of Texas Registered Municipal Clerk (TRMC) from the University of North Texas in Denton and the designation of Certified Municipal Clerk (CMC) from International Institute of Municipal Clerks. I am presently employed with the Kingsville Independent School District. I presently serve as Secretary to the USS Kingsville Executive Steering Committee.   I am a member of the Kingsville Chamber of Commerce, Texas Municipal Clerks Association, and the International Institutes of Municipal Clerks.

As a member of the City Commission, my focus has been on:
