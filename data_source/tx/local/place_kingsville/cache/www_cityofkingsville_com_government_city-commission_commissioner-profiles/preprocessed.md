### Sam Fugate

Mayor

Kingsville has always been my home and it gives me no greater pleasure than to give back to the community through public service. I have served on the Kingsville Independent School District Board of Trustees for the past nine years. I am also an active member of the Kingsville Chamber of Commerce and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. My involvement with the Douglas Youth Center, the Javelina and Brahma Booster Clubs stems from their supportive role they play in the community.

Born on December 30, 1953, in Kingsville, I attended Flato Elementary, Memorial Junior High school and H.M. King High School, graduating in 1972. I received a business degree in finance in 1976 from Southwest Texas State University and earned a Jurisprudence Doctorate from St. Mary’s University in San Antonio in 1978. For the last twenty years, I have practiced law in Kingsville.
