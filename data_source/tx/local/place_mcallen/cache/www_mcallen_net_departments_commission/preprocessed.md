Incorporated on February 20, 1911, McAllen is a home rule city and operates under the Council/Manager form of government. All powers of the city and the determination of policy vested in an elective Commission which enacts legislation, adopts budget, determines policies, and appoints the city manager who executes the laws and administers the government of the City. The Mayor is elected at-large while the six City Commission members are elected by district. Terms of office are four years and are staggered. The Mayor presides at meetings of the Commission and may vote on all matters coming before the Commission. The Council elects, from among its members, a Mayor Pro Tempore who presides in the absence of the Mayor.

The Mayor and City Commission have a number of important functions in our community. They are responsible for setting policy, approving the annual budget, determining the tax rates, purchasing and selling property, establishing City Departments, holding public meetings, adopting City Ordinances, and determining city services. In addition it is the Mayor and City Commission who appoint the City Manager, City Attorney, City Secretary, Municipal Court Judge, Fire Chief, Police Chief, and Citizen boards and commissions.

Regular Meetings of the McAllen Board of Commission
are every second and fourth Monday of the month, convening at 5:00 p.m. at the City Commissions Chambers on the 3rd floor at City Hall located at 1300 West Houston Avenue. These meetings are open to the public excluding the executive sessions, which are closed to the public by state law.
