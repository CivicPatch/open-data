The City Secretary serves as the Local Registrar for the Vital Statistics Division and is responsible for submitting birth and death documents recorded in the City of McAllen to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). We are also responsible for tending to requests for certified copies.

The Vital Statistics Division has been linked to the State Online Services since 1996 which provides accessibility to birth records for anyone who was born in the State of Texas from 1926 to the present. Records for those born in the City of McAllen date back to 1904.

Online Vital Records

To request birth and death records from the City of McAllen Vital Statistics Office online, visit the [VitalChek](https://www.vitalchek.com/Campaign/?site=2&clickid=1062568470875406338) website.

Out of State Birth Certificates
-------------------------------

If you would like to request vital records from other states, visit the [National Center for Health Statistics](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w.htm) website for more information.
