Mayor David Chadwick

Greetings and welcome to the City of Center’s website. This website is designed to provide residents and visitors as much information as possible on the City of Center.  We hope that you find this information helpful and useful.

Center is a Home Rule City that provides a full range of services to its residents and visitors.  Our services include public safety, water and sewer utilities, solid waste programs, recreational programs, and an active parks department.  In fact, for a city of about 6,000 people, Center has much going for it and is one of the most progressive cities in East Texas.  It is this entrepreneurial and progressive stance that is positioning Center as a great place to do business with a quality of life second to none.

Center is a community on the move.  We have recently completed a Parks Master Plan study that we will begin implementing very soon.  We will make renovations to all but the newest park, adding amenities such as a splash pad.  We will be constructing multi-use and nature trails throughout the City.  We are making an investment to bring free wireless internet  to our downtown square.  And, we are beginning a cityscape beautification program.

The people who live, work, and play in Center can be assured that the City Council and Staff are being assertive in taking steps to improve the City’s quality of life.  We believe that the community we have today and what we have in the future is not a matter of chance but that we create our own destiny.  Greatness is a choice, it does not happen by accident.  It is a slow journey that takes place every day in every decision we make.  I want to work with you and others in the community to make Center a special place in East Texas.

Sincerely,
David Chadwick
Mayor
