Letter From the Mayor

*Greetings!
On behalf of the City, the Council and the Citizens I would like to welcome you to Kenedy. Whether you are just passing through or here to stay, it is my hope that Kenedy stays with you.
Kenedy is a small town with big opportunities, I like to think this is one on the many things that makes Kenedy the perfect place to live! I would like to personally invite you to take in all that Kenedy has to offer, there is something here to fit every interest and lifestyle. Take a day and enjoy our newly renovated park that includes a basketball court, baseball diamonds, sand volleyball court, walking trail, picnic area, playground, and veteran’s memorial.  The hills come alive in the spring with beautiful displays of wildflowers, Kenedy Market Days is the third Saturday of every month with booths from local farmers and artisans.
Thank you for joining us at “The Junction Where Good Friends Meet” and enjoy our little slice of life! If you have any Questions, please do not hesitate to ask!*
