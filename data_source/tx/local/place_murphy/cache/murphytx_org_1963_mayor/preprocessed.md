Mayor
=====

The City Council and I would like to welcome you to the City of Murphy website! If you are not sure where Murphy is, that is because it is one of the best kept secrets in the Metroplex. It is located in southeastern
Collin County
- the fastest growing county in the nation – between the cities of
Parker
,
Plano
,
Richardson
, and
Wylie
. We are fortunate to be surrounded by great communities that cooperate with us to make this entire area the best it can be.

Murphy is served by 2 outstanding and award-winning school districts –
[Plano Independent School District](http://www.pisd.edu/ "Plano Independent School District")
and
[Wylie Independent School District](http://www.ci.wylie.tx.us/ "Wylie Independent School District")
. This has made our city particularly popular for families with school-aged children. Our city is known for friendly neighborhoods and community involvement. Murphy is close to downtown Dallas and within commuting distance to anywhere in the Metroplex and yet has managed to maintain its small-town feel and charm.

Despite our efforts to keep it all to ourselves, the word is getting out about the City of Murphy and what a great place it is to live, work, and raise a family. That is demonstrated by the fact that we have been one of the fastest growing cities in Collin County with a growth rate of 415% from 2000 through 2010. The fact that the city has consistently been ranked by
D Magazine
as one of the Metroplex’s top 10 best suburbs for the past 5 years has also drawn attention to our amazing community.

For those of you who are fortunate to call Murphy home, I thank you for your help in making this such a wonderful community. Thank you for your service throughout the city and your willingness to reach out and help others. It makes a difference to be associated with such talented and giving neighbors.

I would like to encourage all of you to find ways to stay involved where you can and be a part of the growth and uniqueness that Murphy has to offer. There are many ways to volunteer and share your talents with others; and as a city, we need your help. Please consider the opportunity to serve on a
board or commission
or join
Neighborhood Crime Watch
or
Volunteers in Policing
.

The City of Murphy is a wonderful community and we look forward to continuing to make it even better. We are always looking for ways to improve on communication and opportunities to serve. Please contact me or any member of the City Council if you have questions or ideas!
