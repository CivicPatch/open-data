After two unsuccessful attempts for City Council District 5 in 2019 and 2021, Daniel's district was realigned, prompting him to run for the May 2024 General Election City Council District 6 position. His perseverance paid off, as he was sworn in on May 14, 2024, to represent District 6, showcasing the trust and confidence his community places in him to advocate for their interests and concerns.

Daniel's goals for the City of Big Spring include establishing a transparent government, improving infrastructure, ensuring essential city services are adequately funded and staffed, attracting new businesses, and keeping taxes low to support the economic well-being of the community.
