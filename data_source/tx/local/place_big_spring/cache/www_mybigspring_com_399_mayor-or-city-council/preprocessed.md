To make Big Spring one of the most livable communities in America. To create a vibrant, progressive, clean city that rejoices in its diversity. To keep our citizens safe and secure, and provide an abundance of economic development opportunities while paying special attention to our unique environment.
The Big Spring City Council provides legislative leadership in establishing ordinances, resolutions, and other polices designed to provide effective administration of City departments to ensure orderly development of the City and to promote the safety and welfare of the Citizens of Big Spring.
Big Spring has a Council-Manager form of local government. Policies are set by the Mayor and City Council, who are elected by the citizens. Policies are carried out by the City Manager. The Council decides what is to be done and the City Manager implements it with the assistance of the entire City Staff.
City Council Meetings are open to the public; the Council wants to assure that any citizen may speak in support or against any item on the agenda and encourages the expression of all views before action is taken.
There are numerous City Boards, Commissions, and Committees established to provide advice to the Council on City matters. If you are interested in serving on a board, commission or committee, contact the City Manager Office's in person or by calling 432-264-2401, or review information on the
Boards and Committees page
to print an application out.
