### The City of Big Spring's boards, commissions, and committees provide a vital link between citizens and the City Council. Boards, commissions, and committees help keep our City government dynamic, responsive and accountable. The City could not function without the outstanding advice, expertise and time provided by the civic volunteers who serve on these boards. Serving on a City board provides an excellent opportunity to make a difference in your community and provides a way to become a participant in the municipal government process.  The City of Big Spring is truly grateful for the dedicated and loyal board members and their service to our City. Board appointments are generally made by the City Council.  All individuals considered for appointment by the City Council to a board, commission or committee must have an application on file in order to be considered for appointment by City Council.  Prospective applicants and existing members wishing to extend their service are considered for appointment by the City Council in the month of September. Applications for appointment are valid for no more than one year.  After a year, applicants are asked to either reapply or update their applications to ensure that the information is accurate. Please contact the City Secretary’s Office at (432) 264-2513 for more information.
