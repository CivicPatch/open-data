City Council
============

Overview
The
[City Charter (PDF)](https://www.rockdaletx.gov/DocumentView.aspx?DID=26 "City Charter link")
provides for a Council-Manager form of government where the
[city manager](https://www.rockdaletx.gov/81/City-Manager "City Manager link")
is responsible to the City Council. The Charter provides for a Mayor and six Council Members with the Mayor being elected at-large. Three Council Members are elected from the east ward and three Council Members are elected from the west ward.

The Mayor, or in his/her absence the Mayor Pro-Tem, is the presiding officer at City Council meetings but may only vote in case of a tie vote among Council Members. The Mayor and each Council Member serve three-year staggered terms and there are no term limits. The City Charter prohibits salaries for the Mayor or Council Members but they may be reimbursed for their expenses related to their Council service.

The responsibilities of the City Council include but are not limited to the following:

* Adopting the annual budget
* Adopting, amending or repealing
  [ordinances](https://www.rockdaletx.gov/41/Codes-Ordinances "Codes and Orrdinances link")
