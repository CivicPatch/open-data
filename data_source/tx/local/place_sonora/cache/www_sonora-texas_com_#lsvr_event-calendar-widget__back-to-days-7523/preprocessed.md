[Welcome from the Mayor](https://sonoratexas.gov/welcome-from-the-mayor/)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------




As the Mayor, it is my privilege and honor to welcome you to the beautiful City of Sonora Texas. Sonora has been a wonderful home to not only my family but to so many others as well. There is no question that we are fortunate to live in such a beautiful city, surrounded by world renowned caverns, Eaton Hill and the beautiful oak trees that give us shelter.

While all of these things are wonderful and a big reason Sonora attracts so many visitors from around the world, it is the beauty of the people of Sonora that makes the city great. You can see this in the warm smiles that greet you in our shops and stores to the invaluable folks at our state-of-the-art medical facilities and in our school system that is ranked among the top 20% in the State of Texas.

Our vision is to continue to grow in excellence as a community, providing not only a place that is memorable to visit but a city that is filled with pride for the people that call it home. I am always out in our community so whether you are a visitor or a fellow resident, don’t hesitate to stop me and say hello. If I can be of assistance, please call my office and for Mayoral updates please visit my Mayor’s Corner on social media. Welcome to Sonora, welcome to our home!

Juanita Gomez, Mayor
