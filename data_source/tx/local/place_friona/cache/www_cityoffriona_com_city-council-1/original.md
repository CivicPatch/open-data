Friona City Council
===================

Friona is a **Type A General Law Municipality**. What does this mean? A general law city has no charter and may only exercise those powers that are specifically granted or implied by city code. Friona operates under the aldermanic plan of government. The term “alderman” is often used interchangeably with the term city council, and the modern name of the board of aldermen is the city council. The Friona City Council meets on the second Monday of each month.

The city council always consists of a mayor and five council members. The mayor does not vote except in the case that his vote is needed to break a tie. A Type A city council member has a two-year term of office unless a longer term of office is adopted. In a council-manager city, as in any other, the council serves as the legislative body. The council sets policy, approves the budget, and sets the tax rate. It determines the size of the payroll and the extent and cost of municipal services. In short, the council is the final authority on all of the many policy decisions that determine the scope and functions of the city government.
