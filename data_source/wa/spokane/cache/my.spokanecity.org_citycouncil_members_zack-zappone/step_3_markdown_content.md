 *City Council Member, District 3* 

Term: 2022-2025

 [zzappone@spokanecity.org](mailto:zzappone@spokanecity.org) 

Council Member Zappone represents northwest Spokane. He is a sixth-generation Eastern Washingtonian, teacher, and public health worker. He is dedicated to advocating for all people.

Zack saw first-hand that no matter how hard his students worked, they continued to face obstacles to upward mobility outside of the classroom. He saw that the lack of access to healthcare services, safe walking routes to school, or living-wage jobs continued to be a barrier to equity and a stronger community for his students. He currently teaches English part-time at his alma mater, North Central High School.

Zack is passionate about serving our community, volunteering with community vaccine clinics like the Native Project. He also served with the Spokane Food Fighters during the Coronavirus pandemic, witnessing the extent of income inequality and hardship in the community while helping to deliver over 100,000 meals to Spokanites in need.

Zack graduated from Georgetown University and has a master’s in public affairs from Princeton University. Zack is focused on creating ways to lift up working and middle class families, and to serve our community to make sure everyone has a fair shot.
