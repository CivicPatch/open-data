 [mcathcart@spokanecity.org](mailto:mcathcart@spokanecity.org) 

Michael Cathcart is a dedicated public servant and advocate for Spokane’s District 1, which includes Northeast Spokane and parts of Downtown. First elected to the Spokane City Council in 2019 and re-elected in 2023, Cathcart has earned a reputation as a pragmatic, results-driven leader focused on enhancing public safety, housing affordability, and neighborhood revitalization.

Cathcart’s leadership is rooted in practical problem-solving and a commitment to transparency and accountability. Michael has introduced and advanced policies to address systemic challenges, from budget reforms, public safety enforcement, to critical language access needs, and others.

With a strong background in public policy, Cathcart has previously served in several roles including as a legislative aide to former state Senator and current Congressman Michael Baumgartner, where he gained valuable experience in policymaking and collaboration. His experiences, including his past involvement as a Neighborhood Council Chair, have shaped his collaborative and community-centered approach to governance.

Michael’s past efforts have been recognized multiple times, including the Spokane Association of Realtors’ Community Partner of the Year and recognition from the North East Community Center for his strong advocacy in expanding community resources in Northeast Spokane.

A graduate of Montana State University, Cathcart lives in Spokane’s Shiloh Hills neighborhood with his wife, Vina, and their young son. Michael is a devoted family man who brings both personal and professional experiences to his vision of making Spokane a safe, vibrant, and opportunity-rich city for all.

As the most senior member of the City Council, Cathcart continues to work toward a brighter, safer, transparent and accountable future. Michael has previously served as Council President Pro Tem, Chair of the Public Safety & Community Health Committee and Chair of the Finance and Administration committee.
