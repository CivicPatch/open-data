James has been a resident of Renton since he moved to the Pacific Northwest from Ohio in 1997. He and his wife, Jessica, live in the Renton Highlands and have three daughters – Hannah, Olivia, and Sofia.  

James initially began his involvement with the city as a member of the Renton Chamber of Commerce, where he eventually served as Board President, and currently remains as a Board Member.  Most recently, he served as a Planning Commissioner for the city for two years.  Additionally, he has served as the HOA President of his neighborhood’s homeowners’ association for 13+ years.  James has a passion to see Renton reach its highest potential and to ensure Renton residents feel proud to call Renton their home.  He believes that Renton can and should be the envy of all cities in the region, and is dedicated to creating that vision.

James graduated at the top of his class with a M.B.A. in Marketing from the Purdue University and a B.S. in Computer Technology from Purdue as well.  James currently owns and operates a Sandler Training Franchise, where he works with company leaders and their teams to put structures, processes, and skills in place to create greater company growth and success.  Having been a business owner for fifteen years, and in various corporate leadership positions previous to that, James will bring his experience in strategic planning and tactical execution to the city council, as he looks to help shape a prosperous future for the city.
