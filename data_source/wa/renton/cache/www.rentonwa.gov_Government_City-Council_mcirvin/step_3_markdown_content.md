Ryan McIrvin is serving his third term on the Renton City Council. Prior to his election for the 2016 term, he was a member of the Renton Human Services Advisory Committee, which reviews and recommends funding allocations to local agencies serving vulnerable populations.

A native of South King County, Ryan graduated from Decatur High School in Federal Way. He earned his bachelor's degree in Politics, Philosophy, Economics, and Communication from Western Washington University, where he was an active member of the debate team; competing at local, national, and international levels.

Professionally, Ryan serves as the Director of Government and Community Relations at the University of Washington Bothell. In this role, he advocates for the university's interests across local, state, and national platforms, fostering partnerships with businesses, municipalities, and community organizations, and promoting workforce development initiatives that strengthen the region’s economy.

Before his current role, Ryan served as the Director of Government and Public Affairs for the Snohomish County-Camano Association of REALTORS®, where he worked on finding creative solutions to planning and land use policies to balance the need for both a healthy environment and affordable housing.

An avid runner, Ryan trains for and competes in ultra marathon distance races, further fueling his passion for physical activity and community engagement. He volunteers with organizations such as the Issaquah Alps Trails Club, advocating for trail preservation, and Renton parkrun, supporting community running events. He has also volunteered as a coach for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's Team in Training and Girls on the Run Puget Sound program.

Ryan and his wife, Stefanie, own their home in Renton's Cascade Neighborhood and reside there with their daughters, Molly and Lena.
