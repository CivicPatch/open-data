Have questions about your city? Mayor Jon Nehring invites you to join him for a casual conversation on Monday, Sept. 22, from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. in the Council Chambers at the Marysville Civic Center, 501 Delta Ave. We’ll bring coffee and cookies.

The meeting will also take place on Facebook Live. If you plan to join remotely, follow the City of Marysville Facebook page (@MarysvilleWashington) to set a reminder. City staff will also be on hand to help answer your questions.

A regular City Council meeting will follow at 7 p.m. Find the City Council agenda at [https://www.marysvillewa.gov/CityCouncil](https://www.marysvillewa.gov/CityCouncil​).
