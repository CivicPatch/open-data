![](https://www.cityoffircrest.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Bufford-200x300.jpg)Nikki Bufford is serving her first term on Fircrest City Council and was appointed by her Council peers to serve as Mayor Pro Tempore for 2024-2025. She currently works in the utility space as an Energy Risk Manager and brings to Council over 15 years of success in finance roles spanning both the public and private sectors.

Nikki is currently Fircrest’s alternate representative on the Pierce County Regional Council (PCRC). She was selected by PCRC to represent Pierce County cities and towns on the Puget Sound Regional Council Growth Management Policy Board.

After completing dual undergraduate degrees in finance and economics from Central Washington University, Nikki has molded her career around a keen interest in compliance and continuous improvement. She has championed many operational and change management initiatives to develop and implement new processes and efficiencies while improving collaboration and cross-departmental communications.

Nikki is committed to utilizing a forward-looking and inclusive approach to building connections with the community and fostering a sense of belonging. She is proud to call Fircrest home and is excited to work together with residents, City staff, and City Council Members to ensure that decisions are made with input and involvement from all community stakeholders.

In her downtime Nikki enjoys hiking, rock climbing, crafting, and exploring new activities with family and friends. She and her husband Staley live in the south end of Fircrest with their dog Watson and 3 feline roommates. Originally from University Place, Nikki is the third of four sisters and enjoys frequent gatherings with extended family.
