**Councilmember Ariana Sherlock**

Ariana Sherlock lives in the Hazelwood neighborhood with her husband (Ryan), two children (Delain &amp; Liam), rescue dog (Fid), and rescue cat (Goose). Ariana and Ryan love raising their family in Newcastle and feel so lucky to be part of this amazing community. The Sherlocks relocated to Newcastle from Portland, Oregon, in 2013. They found a home close to Donegal Park and a short distance from the public library, a perfect location for the whole family. After enjoying the events at Lake Boren Park during their first year in Newcastle, the Sherlocks knew they had found an amazing place to call home. 

Ariana, now in her sixth year on the Newcastle City Council, was re-elected for a second term in 2023. This four-year term started at the beginning of 2024 and will end in 2028. Councilmember Sherlock is passionate about maintaining a high quality of life for all residents of Newcastle. She has advocated for state funding to help with parks, trails, and transportation projects, helping bring almost $1M in grants to our city.

Ariana is a classically trained chef and has worked in restaurants, wineries, and in private homes as a personal chef over the past 20+ years. She has previously served as the president of both the Hazelwood Elementary School PTSA and the Hazelwood Community Association. In her spare time, Ariana loves trying new recipes and testing them out with family and friends. The Sherlocks also enjoy board games, camping, playing music, and cruising around the Puget Sound on the family sailboat.
