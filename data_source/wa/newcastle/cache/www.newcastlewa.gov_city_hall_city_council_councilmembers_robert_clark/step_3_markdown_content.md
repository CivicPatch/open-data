**Mayor Robert Clark** 

Robert Clark has been a Newcastle resident since he and his wife, Kelly, bought their home in the Hazelwood community in 2006, the year they were married. Robert has worked in West Seattle for nearly 25 years, where he’s currently an electrical engineer. He’s held a variety of roles in the industry, including many years as a maintenance and production supervisor. He came to Seattle when he was fresh out of college at the Colorado School of Mines, where he earned Electrical Engineering degree. Prior to college, Robert proudly served 10 years in the U.S. Navy.  

Robert’s wife, Kelly, is a personal trainer, and they have a small puppy named Picard. You might catch them on their daily walks or hikes around the neighborhood or on Newcastle’s trails. Robert and his family enjoy all the outdoor amenities the city offers. They enjoy camping and racing in triathlons, and for many years Robert commuted from Newcastle to West Seattle on his bike.  

Veterans’ issues are of special importance to Robert, who’s active in the VFW and American Legion, and serves as part of the honor guard at Tahoma National Cemetery.  

**Committee Appointments:** 

Newcastle Salary and Benefits Committee   
Sound Cities Association North Mayors Group
