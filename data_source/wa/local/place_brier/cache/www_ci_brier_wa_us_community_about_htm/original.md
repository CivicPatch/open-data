The population is approximately 6,300.    The City government consists of about 19 employees, working in three public services departments. Brier is 2.13 square miles with approximately 27 miles of streets and roads.   Throughout the City of Brier's history, development has resulted in an area characterized by large homesites, wooded and semi-rural in nature.   The philosophy of the City is to continue to retain and maintain the basic, original, spacious and semi-rural wooded character of the areas and to remain relatively small, simple and intimate, with a minimum of regulation and taxation. It is intended that the future development of Brier will be consistent and harmonious with the established pattern.   The overall goal of the City government is to preserve the existing character of The City of Brier as a single-family residential community, placing emphasis on the preservation of open space and natural landscape.   **Click each map for a larger view.**    ---     **Brier History Book**    To commemorate the 55th anniversary of the City of Brier's founding, the City developed a book describing its history. We would like to thank the Lynwood-Alderwood Manor Heritage Association, numerous community members and the Snohomish County Historic Commission for the Historic Preservation Grant all of which were invaluable in completing the project.
