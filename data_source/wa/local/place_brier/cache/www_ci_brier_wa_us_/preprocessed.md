The measure sought to increase the City of Brier's regular property tax levy to maintain public safety and other essential city services. Final certification from Snohomish County Elections is expected this week.     "We respect the will of the voters although we were hoping for a different outcome," said Mayor Dale Kaemingk. "The budget pressures that led to this proposal remain unresolved. City leadership will now consider how to address these challenges moving forward, including possibility of a revised ballot measure in the future."     Without additional funding, the City will evaluate potential impacts to service levels across departments, including administration, police, public works and other core functions. The City currently faces an annual deficit of about $500,000, which has been forecasted to result in a negative balance in the General Fund by 2029.
