Brownfield

**City of Palouse Brownfield Project**

The City Council has approved a project proposal!   Purchase agreement is in progress.

**The City of Palouse had received a number**
of inquiries about the property on East Main Street, formerly owned by Palouse Producers, on topics ranging from general cosmetic cleanup needs to future reuse. The “Palouse Producers Brownfield” is located on the right bank of the North Fork Palouse River. The condition of the property, possible contamination of the substrate, and risk to the river were not fully understood. Before city officials could decide what to do, they needed to find out more information about the property’s history and condition, and look at potential reuse options. The City of Palouse was able to find answers to these questions through the use of a Washington Dept. of Ecology (DOE) Integrated Planning Grant (IPG). The funding allowed the city to hire the experts needed to fill in the blanks.

the site has been cleaned and is ready for reuse. The city would like to see the property back in the hands of a private owner and developed to enhance Palouse’s downtown, and be of value to its citizens once again.
