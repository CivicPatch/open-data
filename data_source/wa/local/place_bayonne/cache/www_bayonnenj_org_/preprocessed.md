The City of Bayonne held a swearing-in ceremony for fourteen new police officers. The new recruits are taking the place of police officers who have retired recently. Five of the new Bayonne police officers transferred from other police departments and law enforcement agencies. The ceremony took place in the City Council Chambers. The event was the first time that Robert Kubert attended a police promotional ceremony as Mayor since he succeeded former Mayor Davis, who is now Hudson County Sheriff. Mayor Kubert remains Public Safety Director. Speaking about being Mayor, Kubert said, “I really appreciate the opportunity to serve in this capacity.” He thanked former Mayor Davis and the City Council for having supported the new police recruits. Mayor Kubert said that the job of police officer “is not what it is on television.” He said the Bayonne Police Department “has prided itself on being a service organization.” He urged the new officers “to serve with pride.” Speaking to the families of the new officers, Mayor Kubert thanked them for the sacrifices they have made. He advised the families that the new officers would start studying for the sergeant’s exam.
Police Chief Joseph Scerbo said that the occasion of the swearing-in ceremony for the new police officers was “a great day for the citizens of Bayonne.” Speaking to the new recruits, Chief Scerbo called policing “a calling, not just a career.” He explained that the Police Department’s motto, “To Protect and Serve” is “a mantra that this department lives by every single day.” Chief Scerbo pointed out that community policing is “a key part of that mission,” and that the officers should “embody integrity” with each moment. He pledged to support the new officers, to “lead from the front,” and to have their backs as long as they “are doing the right thing.”
Council Member At-Large Loyad Booker, a retired police officer, said that police swearing-in ceremonies are “one of the most enjoyable parts of this job.” He called being a police officer “the best job in the world.”
The new Bayonne police officers are Kaery Rivas, Devin Ortiz, Joseph Vuolo, James Young, Brayden Cotter, Nicholas Toolen, Elias Statham, Andrew Johnston, Giuseppe Pagano, Robert Geisler, Jr., Nicholas Kiniery, Herving Rullon, Nicholas Vazquez, and Marving Delacruz.

City Clerk Madelene C. Medina has announced that nominating petitions for the May 12, 2026, Municipal Election will be available in the City Clerk’s Office at the Municipal Building, 630 Avenue C, Bayonne, NJ, beginning Friday, January 16, between 8:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Voters will select a mayor, two council members at-large, and one council member in each of the city’s three wards for four-year terms to commence July 1, 2026.
Candidates for election to municipal office must be registered voters and residents for at least one year and may only run for one office. Ward council candidates must have been residents of the ward in which they live for at least one year. Each candidate must submit a nominating petition that consists of separate petition certificates signed by a number equal to five percent of the voters by whom he or she is to be elected. The number of voters needed for each petition was calculated based on the voter turnout in Bayonne in the General Election that took place on November 4, 2025. Mayor and council member at-large candidates must obtain 870 valid signatures. First Ward council candidates need 300 signatures. Second Ward nominees will require 260 signatures. Third Ward candidates must submit 315. The filing date for the signature certificates and additional documents (Designation of Campaign Manager, Acceptance of Nomination, Request for Ballot Designation, etc.) is Wednesday, February 26, at 4:00 p.m. Signatures will be verified by the City Clerk’s Office, after which a ballot position drawing will be held.
Municipal elections in the City of Bayonne are “nonpartisan” by law. Candidates may submit a ballot designation not to exceed six words that may not include political party references (Democrat, Republican, Democratic, GOP, etc.) Candidates who run as a group or slate may not be included in the same row or column on the ballot. However, two candidates for Council Member at-Large may request that their names be listed on the ballot together with the same ballot designation.
Candidates will be supplied with more certificates than the number required to get on the ballot. Requests for petition packages must be made by candidates, who may authorize a third party to pick up the package. The request, however, must be signed by the actual candidate. Candidates may duplicate the materials at their own expense, in order to facilitate signature gathering or to file more petitions than the number supplied. “In the past, some candidates have had several people pick up nominating materials, apparently as a means to file a large number of nominating petitions. This practice can cause shortages in the number of available certificates, and delays while additional petition forms are printed, and additional expense to the taxpayers,” Ms. Medina said. Candidates desiring nominating petitions or their representatives should contact the City Clerk to request a package of petition papers. Application forms for nominating petition packages are available at the City Clerk’s Office between 8:30 AM and 4:00 PM Monday through Friday, except holidays. The petition papers should be available to requesters immediately, or within 24 hours if supplies have run out.

***Photo Caption: The City of Bayonne, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and New York Waterway held a groundbreaking ceremony on the site of the future Bayonne ferry terminal at the former Military Ocean Terminal. Pictured left to right: Armand Pohan, President and CEO of New York Waterway; Michael Bozza, Deputy Director, Port Authority; City Council President Gary LaPelusa; City Council Member At-Large Juan Perez; City Council Member At-Large Loyad Booker; Mayor Jimmy Davis;  Port Authority Chairman  Kevin O’Toole; Second Ward Council Member Jacqueline Weimmer; and Bayonne Public Works Director Tom Cotter.***

The City of Bayonne, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and New York Waterway held a groundbreaking ceremony on December 17 at the future location of the Bayonne- New York ferry. That parcel is located on the southern side of the former Military Ocean Terminal, about one mile east of the main part of Bayonne. The future terminal will be located next to a former military motel, whose address is 51 Port Terminal Boulevard.
At the ceremony, Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole said it was “a great day for Bayonne.” He predicted that the ferry would be part of “a shinier future” for the community. Chairman O’Toole said that Bayonne Mayor Jimmy Davis wanted to have a locally owned terminal that would provide “real transportation to New York and back.” The Port Authority leader said that the ferry “will transform this region and Bayonne.”
Armand Pohan, President and CEO of New York Waterway, said, “We are excited to be partnering with the City of Bayonne to bring safe, reliable and convenient ferry service to commuters and families of this great city.” Mr. Pohan.continued, “Bayonne is growing in impressive ways. Adding ferry service will not only provide a better quality of life for those who live here now, it will be a great incentive for anyone thinking about making Bayonne their home. We look forward to serving the Bayonne community for many years to come.”
Mayor Davis predicted that ferry service would “change the economic future of Bayonne.” He thanked New York Waterway for its partnership with Bayonne. He predicted that “ridership will explode.” Mayor Davis said that the City of Bayonne worked “side by side” with the Port Authority.” He thanked Port Authority Chairman O’Toole. The mayor said that working with the Port Authority was “always about the people of Bayonne.”
Following the speeches, representatives of the City of Bayonne, the Port Authority, and New York Waterway broke ground next to the southern shore of the former Military Ocean Terminal.
In order to have a location for the ferry, the City of Bayonne is obtaining 2.3 acres of land from the Port Authority for $4.4 million. Of those 2.3 acres, 1.6 acres will be used for the ferry terminal and a parking facility, and 0.7 acres will be used for expanding the local waterfront walkway. Lincoln Equities, a neighboring private property owner, is donating an additional acre of land for the facility.
