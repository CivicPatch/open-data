-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted March 03, 2023


At a special meeting on March 2, 2023 the Bayonne City Council unanimously approved Mayor Jimmy Davis’s nomination of Joseph Skillender, Jr. as Director of the Department of Planning, Zoning, and Economic Development.  That department was created as part of the Davis Administration’s local government reorganization plan that the Council approved last year.  Mayor Davis said, “Economic development and growth have been the major goals of our City Administration since it began in 2014. The new Department of Planning, Zoning, and Economic Development will continue these policies and help us build a great future for Bayonne. I look forward to working with Joe Skillender as Bayonne moves forward to a brighter tomorrow.”  Director Skillender responded, “I would like to thank Mayor Davis and the City Council for entrusting me with this opportunity to help our city grow and prosper for years to come.  We will work hard to bring new businesses, high-paying jobs, and quality housing to our hometown.”
