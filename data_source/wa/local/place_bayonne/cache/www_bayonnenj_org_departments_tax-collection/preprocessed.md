[Bayonne Third Quarter Property Taxes Due by Grace Date of Thursday, August 10](https://www.bayonnenj.org/News/View/11592/bayonne-third-quarter-property-taxes-due-by-grace-date-of-thursday-august-10)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Bayonne Tax Collector’s Office announced that third quarter property tax payments are due on
**Thursday, August 10**
. The nominal legal due date for the tax bills was Tuesday, August 1.  The City Council authorized a grace period through the close of business on Thursday, August 10.  Payments made by that date will avoid a late fee.  Property owners may pay their taxes by mail or in person at City Hall, 630 Avenue C, or at Bayonne branches of BCB Bank, or online through the City of Bayonne website,
www.bayonnenj.org
.

By state law, quarterly payments received after the close of business on Thursday, August 10, will incur interest charges dating back to Tuesday, August 1, the nominal, legal due date for the third quarter.  For anyone making payment in person on August 10, the Tax Collector’s Office strongly recommends paying in person at City Hall before the close of business that day at 4:30 p.m.  You can pay at the Tax Collector’s Office.

Those who handle their property taxes through their monthly mortgage payments should have received advice copies of the property tax bills in the third quarter tax mailing.  They should continue paying their property taxes through their mortgages.

The third quarter tax bill is an estimated one, because Hudson County did not set a 2023 tax rate before the bills were mailed.  This estimated bill has the same status as a regular tax bill and may be paid without interest through Thursday, August 10, the date specified as the end of the grace period.

A final, reconciled tax bill for the year will be issued to taxpayers prior to Wednesday, November 1, 2023.
