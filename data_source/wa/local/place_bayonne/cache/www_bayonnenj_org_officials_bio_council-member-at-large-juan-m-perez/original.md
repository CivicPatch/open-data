### Council Member-at-Large Juan M. Perez

  

**What have been your greatest achievements on the City Council?**

Bringing in development has been our biggest achievement. We have been working as a team to bring Bayonne into the 21st century with tax ratables.

I am proud of the ordinance I introduced that requires bins for used clothing to be on private property.  They used to be on public streets and were an eyesore.

I like working on quality-of-life issues, sensible development, and bringing jobs to Bayonne.  I believe in ordinances that promote “Bayonne First” for good jobs, meaning a preference for Bayonne residents. I am excited about Costco’s coming to Bayonne.  That business will provide an opportunity for residents to get hired.

**What do you still want to achieve on the City Council?**

I want to find more funding for senior programs, a better school funding formula for our kids, and to eliminate Bayonne’s budget deficit.

**What do you like about being a Council Member?**

I enjoy helping people.  As somebody who comes from a poor family, I help the less fortunate.  It’s a good feeling when I can say that I did something good today.

**What is your favorite movie?**

Rocky is my favorite movie, because he was the underdog, and because the real Rocky was a Bayonne boy, Check Wepner.  I began my life as an underdog, struggling.  My mother spoke no English. I was the first in my family to go to college.  I know what it’s like to fight my way up.

My other favorite movie is The Quiet Man.  It tells the story of a man from the U.S. trying to assimilate in another country - Ireland.

**What is your favorite childhood memory?**

My favorite childhood memory is sitting down to have dinner with my family -  my mother, brothers, and sisters – having discussions over food. I miss my mother.  Those dinners are a good memory.    
  
**What is your favorite color?**

I can’t pick just one.  They are red, white, blue, and green.

**What is your favorite sports team?**

The New York Giants.

**What is your favorite book?**

Patton: Ordeal and Triumph  is my favorite book. It led to the movie. Patton had a handwriting deficit.  He struggled with skills. That made him an underdog.

**Is there anything else you would like to add to your biography that would help people to understand you personally?**

I have always believed in helping the community.  I have been a school teacher, a state trooper, a deputy police director in Jersey City, Hudson County Sheriff, and now a Bayonne Council Member.  Helping the community as a whole is a wonderful feeling.

**Current Term: July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2026**
