Stanwood has been Steve’s home since 2009.

It motivated Steve to seek a place on Stanwood’s Planning Commission in addition to being a member of the Parks and Trails Advisory Committee.

Steve is currently serving his second term on the Stanwood City Council after having first been elected in 2019. He has served on the City's Public Safety Committee, the Economic Development Committee and is the current Chair of the Community Development Committee. He is also serving  on the Municipal Code Advisory Committee, dedicated to updating Stanwood's    current Codes.
