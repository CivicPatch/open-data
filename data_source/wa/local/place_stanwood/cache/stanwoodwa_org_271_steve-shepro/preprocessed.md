Stanwood has been Steve’s home since 2009. Retired from a career primarily in the printing and publishing fields, Steve has a college degree in Geography (Land Studies) which oriented him to issues affecting urban areas. It motivated Steve to seek a place on Stanwood’s Planning Commission in addition to being a member of the Parks and Trails Advisory Committee.

Steve is currently serving his second term on the Stanwood City Council after having first been elected in 2019. He has served on the City's Public Safety Committee, the Economic Development Committee and is the current Chair of the Community Development Committee. He is also serving  on the Municipal Code Advisory Committee, dedicated to updating Stanwood's    current Codes.

Steve has previously volunteered with Providence Hospice and Homecare and helped lead a   fundraising team for the Stanwood/Camano YMCA.
