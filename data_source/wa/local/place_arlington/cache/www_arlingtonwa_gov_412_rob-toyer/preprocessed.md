Rob and his wife Laurie have recently purchased a home on 5

Rob is a third generation elected official.  His grandmother and his uncle both served as city councilmembers and mayors.

"Carpentry and home remodeling is my passion.  If you’ve ever been to my home, you’ll know that I always have too many home improvement projects going on at the same time.   I also like to spend time in the woods hunting, riding quads and dirt bikes, and enjoying the Pacific Northwest."
