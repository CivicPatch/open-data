[Yvonne Gallardo-Van Ornam](mailto:ygallardo@arlingtonwa.gov)

Appointed to unexpired term June 27, 2022. Term expired December 31, 2023.
Elected Term January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2027.

Yvonne and her husband met during their service in the U.S. Navy at Naval Station Everett in 2003 and settled in Arlington in 2006. They have raised their two children here and appreciate the strong sense of community, outdoor spaces, and quality of life Arlington offers, sharing their home with two dogs and the occasional wild rabbits that call their front yard home.

Baking is Yvonne’s love language, and she enjoys baking for family and friends. Her favorite day of the week is “Sample Sunday,” when she experiments with new recipes for her family’s mobile food booth business and shares the results with neighbors and friends.
