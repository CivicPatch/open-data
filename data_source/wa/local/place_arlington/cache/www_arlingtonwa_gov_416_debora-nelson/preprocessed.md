"I am known as a photographer who captures personal stories. I look for those extraordinary moments throughout the journey of life. Likewise, I look for the extraordinary moments to network and teamwork with people in our town. I love living in Arlington! It is a wonderful town as both a business owner and a citizen. I believe we are at a moment in time when we can choose to grow responsibly in a manner that will ensure the continued economic growth and historic charm of Arlington. We are able to make decisions that will guarantee a strong, sustainable community that is complementary to our Northwest values of family and environment. I believe in working to enhance the safety of our citizens, I have focused on implementing the Complete Streets ordinance that promotes safety and health for all our citizens throughout Arlington. I am honored to serve my community, working for the future of Arlington."
