* [Comments to the Mayor](https://ci.yelm.wa.us/citizen_request_center/index.php)



Joe DePinto was first elected to the Yelm City Council in 2015, reelected to a second term in 2019, and then elected as Mayor of Yelm in 2021. Yelm is his hometown and growing up here Joe attended Prairie Elementary, Mill Pond Intermediate School, Yelm Middle School, and Yelm High School. Joe’s first job was at Pizza Hut when he was 16 years old and later was hired at Yelm Dairy Queen when they first opened. He has coached youth baseball in Yelm, is a member of the Yelm Eagles, and can be found shopping, eating, and frequenting local establishments.
Joe has worked as a staffer for Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a senior legislative aide for State Representative Paul Harris, and currently works as a contract lobbyist representing clients before the Washington State Legislature. His biggest priorities as Mayor are focused around increasing public safety, supporting our local law enforcement officers, and reducing traffic in Yelm. In his personal life, Joe has a love for everything Star Trek, enjoys playing poker, actively plays tennis, and can sometimes be found singing some 90’s hip hop karaoke.
“I am honored to serve as Mayor of my hometown. I will do everything in my power to give back to the community that has given me so much and made me the person I am today. I am a believer in servant leadership and know that I work for the people, not the other way around. If you see me around town, please say hi to me and let me know what you want to see accomplished in Yelm. Remember, this is OUR town!” -
**Mayor Joe**
