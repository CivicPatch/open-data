They are responsible for establishing policy, voting appropriations, developing the city’s vision and mission, and passing local ordinances, resolutions, and proclamations. They are also responsible for appointing the [city manager](https://www.fifewa.gov/218/City-Manager) and the members of the city’s [commissions](https://www.fifewa.gov/191/Boards-Commissions).
