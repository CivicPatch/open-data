# Mayor’s Office

The Mayor is the chief executive and administrative officer of the City, in charge of all departments and employees, with authority to designate department heads subject to Council concurrence. The Mayor presides over all meetings of the City Council, but only has a vote in case of a tie. The Mayor reports to the Council concerning affairs of the City and its financial and other needs and can make recommendations for Council consideration and action. The Mayor directs the preparation of and submits to the Council a proposed budget. The Mayor also has the power to veto ordinances passed by the Council, but a veto may be overridden by five members of the council. The Mayor is the official and ceremonial head of the City and represents the City on ceremonial occasions.
