  [**(show below)## About Council Meetings (available in-person and continued virtual and online options)(show below)]()  

 __Council Meetings Streamed Online__ 

Limited socially-distanced seating is now available on site and in the Council Chamber. ____ To ensure accessibility for the public, in addition to in-person attendance at City Hall, City Council meetings are live-streamed on a variety of platforms such as the  [City website](https://www.kirklandwa.gov/Government/City-Council/Council-Meeting-Minutes-and-Agendas/Watch-City-Council-Meetings)  and the City of Kirkland's  [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/KirklandTelevision/search)  and  [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/kirklandwa.gov)  pages. Community members can also tune in on their television with Comcast Cable Channel 21 or Frontier Cable Channel 31.

Members of the public may address the City Council live during the ‘Items from the Audience’ subject to the Council protocol of a limit of three speakers on each side of a particular issue, for a maximum of three minutes each, or during scheduled Public Hearings, via the Zoom connection link provided on each agenda. 

 __Meetings__ 

There are two types of meetings, both of which are open to the public. Regular meetings are those in which the Council makes local laws, policies, and basic decisions relating to the city. Study sessions are public meetings in which the Council conducts more informal and in-depth discussions of special projects and issues of interest. No official action may be taken by the City Council at a study session.

 __Time__ 

The City Council holds regular meetings on the first and third Tuesday of each month, at 7:30 p.m., in the Council Chamber at City Hall, 123 5th Avenue. Study sessions are held at 5:30 p.m., prior to the regular meetings, in the Council Chamber at City Hall, 123 5th Avenue.

 __Community Participation__ 

The City Council encourages all community members to express their opinions on any matter within the Council's authority. Oral presentations and written communications are both appropriate methods of expression during public meetings. Written communications also may be directed to the City Council or City Manager at City Hall. All such communications will be answered.

On each regular  __Council meeting __ agenda there is an item called "Items from the Audience". This is the time in which a person may present an issue, raise a question or concern, voice a complaint, or even compliment the City. Comments may be made at this time on any subject which is not quasi-judicial in nature or scheduled for a public hearing. Quasi-judicial subjects are specifically noted with an asterisk (*) on Council agendas. (Quasi-judicial matters are typically those which involve obtaining a legal permit for a specific development or land use for which a public hearing has previously occurred.)

Speakers are asked to limit their remarks to three minutes apiece. No more than three speakers may address the Council on any one subject. However, if both proponents and opponents wish to speak, then up to three proponents and up to three opponents of the matter may address the Council.  To participate at a City Council meeting, the speaker must step to the microphone and lectern placed in front of the Council and, after receiving recognition from the Mayor, state their name and neighborhood if it is relevant to the topic you will bring up. All remarks should be addressed to the Council as a group, not to any particular Council member or any member of the City staff or audience.

Whenever a group wishes to address the Council on a subject, the Mayor will normally request that a spokesperson be chosen to speak for the group. Applause or other displays of approval or disapproval are inappropriate and are not permitted during Council meetings.

 __Neighborhood Associations__ 

The City of Kirkland is committed to sustaining strong relations with neighborhood associations and residents.

 [Kirkland's Neighborhood Associations](https://www.kirklandwa.gov/Government/City-Managers-Office/Neighborhood-Services)  serve as an important communications link between the City and its residents. They also provide an effective way for neighbors to improve the quality of life in Kirkland’s Neighborhoods. There are currently eleven associations meeting on a regular basis. For additional information on organizing, Programs, and upcoming meetings check the  [Neighborhood Services Web Page](https://www.kirklandwa.gov/Government/City-Managers-Office/Neighborhood-Services). Stay connected to Kirkland by subscribing to Neighborhood E-Bulletins by going to  [www.kirklandwa.gov](https://www.kirklandwa.gov/)  and click on the Kirkland Email Alerts icon.

 __Volunteer Program__ 

The City operates a  [volunteer program](https://www.kirklandwa.gov/Government/City-Managers-Office/Volunteer-Opportunities) , which allows the City to take advantage of the extraordinary reserve of knowledge, talent, and skill possessed by volunteers within our community. The City's volunteer program involves interested residents in local government by providing the opportunity to perform work of value to the community.

  [**(show below)## Form of Government(show below)]()  

Kirkland operates under the “council-manager” form of government which means all legislative and policy-making powers are vested in the City Council. Policy-making often takes the form of passing  [ordinances or resolutions](https://www.kirklandwa.gov/Government/Departments/Finance-and-Administration/Resolutions-and-Ordinances). The Council employs a professionally-trained public administrator, the  [City Manager](https://kirkland.prelive.opencities.com/Departments/City-Managers-Office/About-the-City-Managers-Office/Meet-the-City-Manager) , to carry out the policies it develops.

In a “council-manager” form of government, the Mayor’s responsibilities are primarily to preside at council meetings, and act as head of the city for ceremonial purposes and for purposes of military law. The Mayor votes as a Councilmember and does not have any veto power. (RCW 35.18.190; RCW 35A.13.030 Optional Municipal Code cities.)

Among many of its duties, the City Council adopts a  [Biennial Budget](https://www.kirklandwa.gov/Government/Departments/Finance-and-Administration/Budget-Information) , approves the  [Six Year Capital Improvement Program](https://www.kirklandwa.gov/Government/Departments/Public-Works-Department/Construction-Projects)  [,](https://www.kirklandwa.gov/depart/Public_Works/Construction_Projects/Capital_Improvements.htm)  and adopts  [ordinances and resolutions](https://www.kirklandwa.gov/Government/Departments/Finance-and-Administration/Resolutions-and-Ordinances). The City Council conducts interviews of interested and eligible applicants and appoints them as members on several  [advisory boards and commissions](https://kirkland.prelive.opencities.com/Government/Boards-and-Commissions) 

The City Council meets the first and third Tuesday of each month with a Study Session followed by a Regular Meeting. Council  [meetings are broadcast live and on-demand](https://www.kirklandwa.gov/Government/City-Council/Council-Meeting-Minutes-and-Agendas/Watch-City-Council-Meetings)  from the City’s webpage. You can subscribe to receive City Council meeting agendas via email by  [visiting the "E-Bulletin" webpage](https://kirkland.prelive.opencities.com/Government/Departments/E-Bulletins).

  [**(show below)## Code of Ethics and Conduct(show below)]()  

In February 2012, the City Council approved  [Ordinance 4348](https://www.kirklandwa.gov/files/sharedassets/public//finance-and-administration/city-clerks-office/ordinance-o-4348.pdf) which established a Code of Ethics for elected and appointed officials of the City of Kirkland.

 __Campaign Contribution Limits__ 

The Kirkland City Council approved  [Ordinance No. 4190](https://kirkland.prelive.opencities.com/files/sharedassets/public/kirkland-city-council/kirkland-municipal-code-3.12.pdf)  which sets dollar limits on  the size of contributions a Kirkland City Council candidate may receive during an election cycle.  The Ordinance is codified as Kirkland Municipal Code Chapter 3.12 and relies largely on the relevant definitions found in state law and on the interpretations of these definitions provided by rule or order of the Washington State Public Disclosure Commission.

Effective June 1, 2010, state campaign contribution limits now apply to City Council candidates. For information, visit the  [PDC website](https://www.pdc.wa.gov/)  or call toll free 1-877-601-2828.

***

 __Common questions about Ordinance No. 4190 are listed below:__ 

 __Are there limits on the acceptance of contributions by Kirkland City Council candidates?__ 

Yes there are limits.  As of April 2023, a City Council candidate may not accept a contribution of more than $1,200 from any person (individual, business, or corporation).  The $1,200 limit is in effect through the 2023 Election Cycle.

The contribution limit is the same as that established by the Washington State Public Disclosure Commission (PDC) for King County office candidates.  From time to time, the PDC will adjust the limits.  To see the current contribution limit set by the PDC,  [visit the PDC website](https://www.pdc.wa.gov/learn).

 __With State and Federal Elections, contribution limits apply separately to the primary and general elections.  Is it the same with the City?”__ 

No, it is not the same.  The $1,200 limit applies to the entire election cycle, there is not a separate limit for the primary and another limit for the general.

 __What’s the Election Cycle?__ 

The election cycle means the combination of the general or special and the primary election and begins on the date when an individual becomes a candidate and ends when the candidate files his or her final report pursuant to  [RCW 42.17.350](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/dispo.aspx?cite=42.17.040) 

 __Are there exceptions to the contribution limits?__ 

Yes.  There are exceptions to the contributions dollar limit for: contributions from a candidate’s own resources; the value of volunteer services; and, with some limitations, surplus funds.  Please see  [Kirkland Municipal Code 3.12.040 (Ordinance No. 4190](https://kirkland.prelive.opencities.com/files/sharedassets/public/kirkland-city-council/kirkland-municipal-code-3.12.pdf) ).
