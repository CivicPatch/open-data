# Councilmember MELISSA BEATON

Melissa is a lifelong resident of Skagit County, raised in Burlington with her 4 brothers. She began her legal career in high school, working for various attorneys. Nearly 30 years ago, she was hired to an entry level position with Skagit County Superior Court and eventually promoted to Superior Court Manager. In 2019, she began the next chapter of her career in the Clerk’s Office serving as the Skagit County Clerk.

Outside of work, Melissa is a proud Skagit Rotarian serving as its first female President in 2018. She is a past member of the Board of Directors of the Skagit Valley Family YMCA and is honored to have been part of the leadership that brought the new facility on Hoag Road to fruition. She is a graduate of Leadership Skagit and volunteered as a team coach for a number of years. She has served on various boards and committees to include the Citizens Advisory and Facilities Planning Committees for the Mount Vernon School District and the Immaculate Conception Regional School serving as school commission board secretary. She also has participated in local academies such as the Mount Vernon Police Department’s Citizens Academy and Fire Ops 101 to better understand the needs & challenges of our first responders.  She is an active member of the Washington State Association of County Clerks, serving as their President in 2023 and recognized as Clerk of the Year in 2024.

Melissa is married, has three daughters, a son, grandchildren, a dog, and a few cats.  In her free time, she enjoys spending time with family and hiking outdoors with her Labrador retriever, Larry David. 

Melissa is grateful for the opportunity to be part of the Mount Vernon City Council and to give back to the community that has given her and her family so much.  Please contact her with any questions, comments, or concerns you may have.
