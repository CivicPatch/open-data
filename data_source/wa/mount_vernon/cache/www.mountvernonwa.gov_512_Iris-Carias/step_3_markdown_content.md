# Councilmember Iris Carias

Iris immigrated to Mount Vernon from Honduras in 1994. She and her husband Alexis have lived here ever since, where they raised their daughter Alejandra who is currently pursuing a law degree.

Iris has always been involved in the community; first as a volunteer in the Police Department’s domestic violence unit, then with Sea Mar Community Health Centers, DSHS, Skagit Valley Hospital and the Friendship House.

Iris has a bachelor’s degree in Humanities and Education from the National Autonomous University of Honduras. She has also taken courses at Skagit Valley College.

She currently works for the Mount Vernon School District as the Migrant Program Educator and is also a member of the Washington State Migrant Education Advisory Committee (SAC). Iris also helps families as a liaison at Community Action of Skagit County and works as a nursing assistant with Sunrise Services. Iris currently serves as a board member of Skagit County Child and Family Consortium, and Skagit Immigrant Rights Council, she is also a member of Community Action’s Latino Advisory Committee.

Mount Vernon is growing and changing and we need a city council that represents all of the residents. Iris believes in giving everyone a voice and helping them achieve their potential. As a social worker, paraprofessional educator and caregiver, she has worked steadily and passionately for the good of our city and its residents.

Iris wants to be an inspiration for the whole community, especially our youth, who will become our next leaders. Let’s work together to unite our community and help our city grow in a healthy and prosperous way!
