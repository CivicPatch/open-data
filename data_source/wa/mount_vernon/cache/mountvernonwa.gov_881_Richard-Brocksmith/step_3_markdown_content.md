# Councilmember RICHARD BROCKSMITH

Richard moved to Mount Vernon in 2013 with his wife and two young children. They quickly recognized that Mount Vernon is an amazing community and special place worthy of protecting and nurturing.  Richard is committed to that endeavor and looks forward to working with the residents of Mount Vernon and our partnering organizations to make our future as bright as our past.

Richard has Bachelors and Masters degrees in science and served as a research scientist across the Western United States before settling in Port Townsend and then Poulsbo in 2001. Richard has worked for the last 17 years leading regional partnerships across government, non-governmental organizations, and citizen groups to conserve Puget Sound's natural resources and economic and cultural legacy.  Richard believes that active involvement, good communication, and strategic partnerships working towards scientifically and culturally-based goals will serve Mount Vernon well.

Richard has been and will continue to be heavily involved in the community.  He is the Executive Director of the Skagit Watershed Council based in downtown Mount Vernon.  He is a member of the Kiwanis Club of Mount Vernon including serving as the Chair of the Scholarship Committee.  He is on the Board of Directors of the Mount Vernon Public Schools Foundation and volunteers regularly in our public schools.  He is engaged in Skagit County's Community Emergency Response Training program and served on Mount Vernon's Planning Commission.

If Richard or the City of Mount Vernon can be of service to you or a local organization, please don't hesitate to be in contact.
