# Councilmember Mary Hudson

Mary has been a Mount Vernon resident for almost 40 years. Raised in an Air Force family, she was born in Saginaw, Michigan and has lived in many parts of the United States, at Ramstein Air Force Base, West Germany, and graduating from La Junta High School in southeast Colorado. Mary’s parents decided to retire to Mount Vernon to be near family. Her younger sisters and 2 nieces graduated from Mount Vernon High School.

Mary currently works for Skagit Habitat for Humanity as Bookkeeper/HR Manager. Prior to that she worked for Spinach Bus Ventures for 3 years and for Wells Nursery for 28 years. Mary is active in many organizations currently serving on the board for Home Trust of Skagit County, NWCAA and on the advisory board for North Star.

Mary looks forward to continuing to serve on the City Council and is excited about this opportunity to give back to Mount Vernon. Please contact her with any questions, comments or concerns you may have.
