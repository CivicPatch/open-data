# Councilmember Mary Hudson

Mary has been a Mount Vernon resident for almost 40 years. Raised in an Air Force family, she was born in Saginaw, Michigan and has lived in many parts of the United States, at Ramstein Air Force Base, West Germany, and graduating from La Junta High School in southeast Colorado. Mary’s parents decided to retire to Mount Vernon to be near family. Her younger sisters and 2 nieces graduated from Mount Vernon High School.

Mary has worked for Wells Nursery in Mount Vernon for 27 years, currently as the General Manager. Outside of work, Mary is active in many organizations. She served as a trustee for the Skagit Valley Hospital Foundation for 10 years, two of which she acted as President, and is still involved with several committees. Mary is also a board member for the Home Trust of Skagit and the Skagit Community Foundation. In addition, she currently serves as Treasurer for the Skagit County Farm Bureau.

Mary looks forward to continuing to serve on the City Council and is excited about this opportunity to give back to Mount Vernon. Please contact her with any questions, comments or concerns you may have.
