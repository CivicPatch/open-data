[Councilmember Ben Thomas](https://www.cityofpt.us/citycouncil/page/councilmember-ben-thomas)

Ben came to Port Townsend in 1976 as a 5-year-old with his commercial fishing family. They were drawn here for the great Port, burgeoning  culture, deep history and – at the time – affordable housing. Ben chose an array of blue collar jobs, travel and founding an alternative newspaper over getting a proper four-year-degree. He now works as a vineyard manager and winemaker. He is married and has a three-year-old child that he hopes will be proud to call Port Townsend home.
