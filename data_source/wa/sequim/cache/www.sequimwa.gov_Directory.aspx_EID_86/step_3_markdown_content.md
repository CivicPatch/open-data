[City Council](https://www.sequimwa.gov/Directory.aspx?DID=5)  
Title: City Council Member  
Phone: (360) 582-2470  
[Email Vicki Lowe](mailto:vlowe@sequimwa.gov)

I was born and raised in Sequim, Washington.  I have lived here my entire life.  I have been married since 1989 and have 5 grown children; 3 daughters and 2 sons.  I have 7 grandchildren.

Education:  I graduated from Sequim High School in 1983.  I have also taken classes at Peninsula College in 1993.

Employment:  I am currently the Executive Director for the American Indian Health Commission, a Washington State non-profit run by a delegation appointed by the Tribes and Urban Indian Health Programs in the State of Washington.  From 1996 to 2015 I worked as the Tribal Benefits Specialist/Manager for the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe.

Volunteer Work/Military Service:  Board Member for the Sequim Schools Alumni Association; Board Member for Peninsula Behavioral Health; Commissioner for the Washington State Women's Commission; Chair for the Washington State Universal Health Care Commission.

Hobbies/Interests:  Family, Community, Culture

What I love about Sequim is that no matter how many people move here from other places, Sequim has managed to maintain a small town atmosphere.  I want to see that continue.  I believe city government should be focused on the needs of our community, be transparent in decision making and act fiscally responsible.  My family has deep roots here.  I know this community and plan to ensure our decisions and deliberations follow the Open Public Meetings Act.  I want to focus on following codes, laws, rules and procedures as well as rely on the expertise of staff and make sure we strike a balance with fulfilling without financially burdening our community and businesses.
