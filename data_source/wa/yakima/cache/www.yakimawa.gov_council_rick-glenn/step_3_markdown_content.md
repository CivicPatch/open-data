I am a lifelong resident of the Yakima Valley.  My parents homesteaded on the Roza Irrigation project near Zillah.  I graduated from Sunnyside High School.  My wife and I raised our family in Yakima and our 5 children graduated from Eisenhower High School.  It has been a wonderful adventure.

My wife teaches in the Yakima School District.   I am a landlord and also involved in several non-profit organizations.  I am an active member of my church.  I am thankful for the support of everyone who supported my campaign for City Council.  I had the privilege of discussing my role as city councilman with more than 2,000 Yakima citizens during my campaign.  I will remember those conversations as I represent not just District 5, but the entire city of Yakima.  Yakima city government exists to serve the citizens of Yakima and I will do my best to add to that service.
