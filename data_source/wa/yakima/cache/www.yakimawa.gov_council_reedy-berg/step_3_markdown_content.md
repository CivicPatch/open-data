# Reedy Berg

![Reedy Berg](https://www.yakimawa.gov/council/assets/reedy-234x300.jpg)

Reedy has been a lifelong resident of the Yakima Valley. Throughout his life, Reedy has been interested in academia, having first attended St. Paul’s Cathedral, Eisenhower High School, and ultimately higher education at Gonzaga University where he received his Bachelor’s degree in 2011. While at Gonzaga Reedy was a collegiate athlete, pitching for the Gonzaga baseball program. His proudest moment was helping his team reach the College World Series Regionals for the first time since 1981. After graduation, Reedy moved back to Yakima to be closer to family. While working in the fruit industry for a number of years out of college, Reedy ultimately decided to pursue a different passion, helping children. After going back to school and receiving his Master’s Degree in Education from Heritage University, Reedy has proudly been working at Toppenish Middle School helping our next generation of students since 2016.

Reedy and his wife have been married since 2015 and have two children together. His family has roots in the Yakima Valley, where most of his family has resided for over 40 years. The Berg family loves Yakima and wants to see every resident have the ability to become successful and make Yakima flourish.

In working with local families through teaching, Reedy understands values as well as concerns families are facing. Reedy decided to run for public office to make every family within our great city be successful in their own individual pursuits. While on the City Council, Reedy promises to be a champion of Public Safety, Small Business Development, and creating a vibrant community for Yakima.

Reedy is driven by his strong work ethic, passion for helping others, and has a desire to find solutions to the toughest challenges facing our community. Reedy will work tirelessly to bring positive outcomes for all residents of Yakima while serving on the Yakima City Council.
