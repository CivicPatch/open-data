I’d like to personally welcome you to the City of Kittitas. The question on most people’s mind is why Kittitas? What IS Kittitas all about? Here’s what you’ll find if you hang out at the local gas station, restaurant, or business in town;

* We are proud to call the City of Kittitas our home because the people in our city are adaptable, flexible, and strong of character.
* We are a city steeped in history with deep roots from generations of family trees that hold us together.

Welcome to the City of Kittitas! You’re invited to explore what makes Kittitas great. The answer is simple. It’s the people.
