Position 5  
Term expires: December 31, 2027

At their meeting on Thursday, April 11, 2024, Ridgefield City Council unanimously appointed Katie Favela to fill a mid-term vacancy after a rigorous and competitive process that included a detailed application, public forum, and interviews with City Council. The term for Position 5 expires in 2027, however Council member Favela will need to retain her seat in the General Election in November 2025 to complete the term.

Councilmember Favela is a licensed clinical social worker with a deep commitment to public service and community well-being. A proud Ridgefield resident for over a decade, she brings both professional expertise and personal investment to her role on the City Council.

Prior to her council service, Katie was a member of the Ridgefield Planning Commission, where she helped guide thoughtful, community-focused development. She also works closely with the Ridgefield School District as a mental health professional, supporting the emotional health of students and families.

A strong advocate for public safety, mental health, and overall community wellness, Councilmember Favela draws on both her professional background and personal experience. As the spouse of a first responder, she understands the importance of supporting those who serve and their families.

Councilmember Favela and her husband are raising two children in Ridgefield: their daughter is entering middle school, and their son is graduating from Ridgefield High School and preparing to serve in the United States Air Force. They also serve as a host family for the Ridgefield Raptors, reflecting their deep commitment to youth and community engagement.
