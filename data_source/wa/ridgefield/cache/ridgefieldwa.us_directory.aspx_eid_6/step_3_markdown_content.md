At their meeting on Thursday, October 10, 2024, Ridgefield City Council appointed Rian Davis to fill a mid-term vacancy after a rigorous and competitive process that included a detailed application, public forum, multiple opportunities for public input and interviews with City Council. 

Councilmember Davis is an 8th grade history and language arts teacher who enjoys running on Ridgefield’s trails and training for triathlons around the county. He has volunteered on the Ridgefield Parks Board since 2018, serving as chair since January 2023. Davis has also spent time on his HOA Board, serving as the Ridgefield representative on the Clark County Mosquito Control District Board of Trustees, and has been active in Ridgefield Little League as a coach and Board member. When asked why he was interested in serving on City Council, Davis wrote in his application, “My desire to serve on the Ridgefield City Council is driven by maintaining and growing the community culture that makes our city special.”
