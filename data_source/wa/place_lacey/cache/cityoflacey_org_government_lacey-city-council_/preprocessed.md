1. Lacey City Council

Lacey City Council
==================

The City operates under a Council-manager form of government. Under this form of government, an elected City Council is responsible for policy-making, and a professional city manager appointed by the council is responsible for the administration of the City organization. Lacey voters elect seven City Councilmembers from the community. Councilmembers serve four-year terms, with municipal elections held in November of odd-numbered years. The City Council selects a Mayor and Deputy Mayor to serve as presiding officer during public meetings and events.

The City Council’s primary duties are to make laws, adopt regulations and budgets, levy taxes, authorize public improvements, provide for public safety and health, approve board and commission appointments, and oversee a wide-ranging agenda for the community of Lacey.

All business of the City Council is conducted in public with the exception of Executive Session items such as property acquisition, personnel issues, and potential litigation. Community members are welcome to attend, listen, and provide comments.

Mission, Vision, & Priorities
Ordinances, Resolutions, & Proclamations

The Council conducts its official business, enacting laws and approving policies during regular Council meetings. Regular Council meetings occur the first and third Tuesday of the month. All regular meetings begin at 6 p.m. in the Council Chambers at Lacey City Hall, 420 College Street SE. Meeting may occur in person, remotely, or a combination of both.
Regular meetings follow a formal and specific format. During a Regular Meeting, Councilmembers make a formal vote on items previously discussed at Worksessions, or Special Sessions. Councilmembers also adopt previous meetings minutes, and present proclamations, ordinances, and resolutions. During Regular Meetings, members of the public have an opportunity to make official comments to the Council during the Public Comment agenda item.
Worksessions provide an opportunity for the full Council to review and discuss issues in depth without taking official action. Council Worksessions occur on the second and fourth Tuesday of each month. All meetings begin at 6 p.m. in the Council Chambers at Lacey City Hall, 420 College Street SE. Meetings may occur in person, remotely, or a combination of both.

During Worksessions, City Council Members discuss topics, receive briefings, reports, and memorandums from City staff, as well as hear presentations from City staff and outside organizations. The Council follows Robert’s Rules of Order during their meetings to ensure courtesy and orderly flow of the meeting. Although most formal Council action occurs at regular Council Meetings, the Council may make decisions and take official action at Council Worksessions.

These meetings provide an opportunity for the Council to review and discuss local and regional issues. They take place in the City Hall Community Room at 4:30 p.m. on the first Tuesday of each month. The meeting ends before the start of the Regular Council Meeting.

Informational Dinner Meetings will meet all necessary requirements for open public meetings. Other than agenda approval, no final action will be taken. These meetings will not be recorded or broadcast, but are open to the public; however, food will not be provided to the general public. Written comment will also be accepted.

Periodically, the City Council holds Special Meetings. During these meetings, only the items listed on the agenda may be discussed.

City Council holds Executive Sessions for items such as property acquisition, personnel issues, and potential litigation. Executive Sessions are closed to the public. No final action can be taken during an executive session.
