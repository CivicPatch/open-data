### City Council Policies

City Council’s operating policies and procedures were originally adopted in 1999 and periodically undergo updates to reflect changes in City policy and practices, changes in state law and updates in technology.

The Council’s Compact is an expression of norms and values of the City Council as a corporate body comprised of individual members with a diversity of views and perspectives. It is intended as a less formal articulation of shared and mutual expectations of Councilmembers than adopted policies. The Council Compact was originally adopted by the Council at its Regular Meeting of July 15, 2013.

### Request a City Council Proclamation

Thank you for requesting a Proclamation from the Mayor, City Council and City of Vancouver. We appreciate the opportunity to acknowledge and support the special occasion or cause.

The City receives many requests to present both new and annually recurring proclamations each and every month. As such, formal presentation of proclamations at City Council meetings is limited.

After review of your request by Staff and the Mayor, the City will provide notification of how the proclamation will be presented. If a formal presentation at a City Council meeting is available, the expectation is there will be a representative on hand to receive the proclamation from the Mayor and make brief comments. If a formal presentation at a City Council meeting is not available, the proclamation will be emailed and mailed.

Requests for City of Vancouver proclamations should be submitted  __30 days prior to the requested Council Meeting date__ , or if it is to be mailed, one month before the scheduled event/activity. City Council meets Mondays at 6:30 p.m. at City Hall. ( [Please refer to the Council meeting calendar for specific dates.](https://cityofvancouver.us/government/calendar/) ) Up to two proclamations may be read per meeting.
