# Office of the Mayor

## Terri Cooper, Mayor

Terri Cooper was elected and sworn into office in January 2022. She serves as the Chief Executive Officer for the City of Medical Lake. Her 25-year career in municipal government administration prepared her for the task at hand; she served 17 of those years as an appointed court commissioner hearing criminal and civil cases in the municipal courts of the West Plains. The mayoral seat is her first elected position. When asked what she found most surprising about being a new mayor, she responded, “How much I enjoy it, I truly love the people I serve.” 

Terri is an advocate for the people and appreciates the rule of law. She feels strongly about the importance of having an open and transparent government, communication being the key, and expects excellence in delivery of government services. Mayor Cooper says, “People doing business with the City of Medical Lake can expect to be served by professional, knowledgeable, and courteous staff members. We hire only the best!”

In her first term, Mayor Cooper cast a vision for a brighter future for Medical Lake. She and her staff have developed long-range strategic plans, secured millions of dollars in infrastructure projects, and engaged with regional partners in relation to shared growth management and problem solving. 

Mayor Cooper believes her city is the hidden gem of the region and expects Medical Lake will soon be known as the premier outdoor recreation destination place of Spokane County. She shares, “We have three lakes within a mile of each other, beautiful parks and trails, seasonal festivals, eclectic eateries and a growing boutique businesses sector; it’s simply the place to be.” 

Come visit the historical healing waters of Medical Lake and you will find there is so much to do on State Route 902.
