# City Council

* * *

#### The Mayor-Council form of Government

The City of Selah has a “strong Mayor” form of local government. This means that the Mayor is elected by the community at large every four years and serves as the City’s chief executive officer. In a mayor-council form of government, all legislative and policymaking powers are vested in the City Council, and administrative authority is vested in the Mayor. Day to day City operations do not fall under the purview of the City Council.

The City Council is the legislative body and consists of seven City Councilmembers who are elected by the community to serve four-year terms.

The Mayor and City Councilmembers serve on a part-time basis, leaving most of the day-to-day operations to full-time administrative personnel.
