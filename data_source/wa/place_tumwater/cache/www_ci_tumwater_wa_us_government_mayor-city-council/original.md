You may also send written correspondence to:

Please note, all city communications are considered public records.

Council meets twice each month, unless otherwise noticed, on the first and third Tuesday at 7 p.m. Meetings are held in the Council Chambers at [City Hall](https://www.ci.tumwater.wa.us/departments/parks-recreation-department/city-facilities/tumwater-city-hall).  In addition, council meets on the second and fourth Tuesday at 6 p.m. in the [Fire Department Headquarters](https://www.ci.tumwater.wa.us/departments/parks-recreation-department/city-facilities/tumwater-headquarters-fire-station) Training Room for an informal [Work Session](https://www.ci.tumwater.wa.us/government/city-council-meetings).

Proclamation Requests

Proclamation requests
---------------------

Requests for mayoral proclamations and other ceremonial documents shall be submitted to the Office of the Mayor for consideration. Proclamation sponsors should provide their request to the mayor along with a draft proclamation for consideration at least 30 days in advance of the event by email, or by mail to:  
  
City of Tumwater  
Mayor’s Office  
555 Israel Road SW  
Tumwater, WA 98501

### In order to issue a proclamation, the following will be considered:

* Preference will be given to proposals of local concern which specifically impact the residents or businesses of Tumwater, or from organizations which represent or provide service to a majority of Tumwater residents in an endeavor to contribute to the quality of life in the City.

* Only one proclamation will be issued per year, per organization. Each renewal request will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

* Proposals for proclamations promoting for-profit causes will generally not be considered.

* Proposals which recognize individuals will generally not be considered unless they concern Tumwater residents or business owners who have made a significant contribution to the City of Tumwater or city employees and officials who are recognized for their service to the city.

* Proposals which promote a position on a pending ballot or legislative issue will not be considered. Pending ballot or legislative issues must be prepared by a council resolution sponsored by a member of the city council following procedures specified in State Public Disclosure Law.

Submission of a proclamation request does not guarantee issuance. Ultimately, the proclamation is issued by the mayor and the mayor reserves the right to reject or modify a proclamation in any way.
