Mayor Joe Marine
================

Joe Marine has lived in Mukilteo twenty-nine years, where he and his wife Candy have raised two daughters, Brandi and Jamie. Caring, approachable, and open to varied ideas and interests, Joe capitalizes on his engaging and optimistic nature to pull others together for comprehensive, inclusive, and well-thought-out solutions.

Joe is a get-it-done kind of person. His experience as an entrepreneur, Mayor, State Representative, and member of many commissions has secured funding for parks and infrastructure improvements that moved
. Joe continues to serve on the board of various non-profits, volunteering for local events, and raising funds for charities.

During his time as Mayor, Joe Marine worked with many people to move long-dormant projects from discussion to action.

For the first time ever, Mukilteo received a AAA bond rating by Standard and Poor's and was ranked twice by Money magazine as one of the top ten best small cities in America - a ranking we'd never had before. We did all of this during one of the worst downturns in our economy, and when he left, we still had close to 40% of our operating budget in reserves.
