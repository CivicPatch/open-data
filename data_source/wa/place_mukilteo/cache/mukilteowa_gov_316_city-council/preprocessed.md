The City of Mukilteo was incorporated in May 1947 and operates as a non-charter code city with a Mayor-Council form of government. The Mayor and seven City Councilmembers are non-partisan elected officials who serve four-year terms. Municipal elections are held in November in odd-numbered years and terms are staggered so that no more than four positions are up for election every two years.

The Mayor is the Chief Executive Officer and the official and ceremonial head of the City. The Mayor proposes an Annual Budget to the City Council and presides over all meetings of the City Council. The Mayor cannot vote on ordinances, franchises or licenses, or for payment of any City monies.

The City Council is the legislative body of the City. It enacts laws and regulations, establishes policy direction for the City, establishes tax and fee rates, adopts an Annual Budget, and approves payments of all City monies. The 2025 Council President is Tom Jordal and Council Vice President is Jason Moon.

The Mayor and Councilmembers actively encourage citizen participation and comments. They can be reached individually via email at the addresses listed below or collectively at
[elected@mukilteowa.gov](mailto:elected@mukilteowa.gov)
. Councilmembers are not assigned offices at Mukilteo City Hall. You can also leave a message with the Executive Department at 425-263-8018.
