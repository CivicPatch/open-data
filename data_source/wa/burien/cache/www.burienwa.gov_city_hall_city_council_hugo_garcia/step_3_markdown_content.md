## Background

 *[See English version below]* 

“La visión de Burien que tenían mis padres cuando nos establecimos aquí como inmigrantes de Guadalajara, México en 1991—una comunidad acogedora, diversa e inclusiva—es lo que todavía veo cuando miro alrededor de nuestra ciudad. Es una comunidad que abre sus brazos a todos los residentes en tantos idiomas diferentes. Es un lugar que apoya y ama a sus pequeñas empresas locales. Es un lugar que ha demostrado que se pueden tener los valores de un pueblo pequeño, sin sacrificar políticas que protejan a los más vulnerables de nuestras comunidades.”

Conozca al concejal Hugo Garcia, un defensor dinámico y apasionado de nuestra comunidad, con una perspectiva única como el único inmigrante en el Concejo Municipal. Originario de Guadalajara, México, el viaje de Garcia a nuestra ciudad ha sido uno de determinación, trabajo duro y un profundo compromiso para abordar cuestiones clave que impactan a nuestros residentes.

Garcia es un firme partidario de la vivienda asequible y del desarrollo de las pequeñas empresas y los trabajadores. Habiendo enfrentado los desafíos de la inmigración de primera mano, comprende la importancia de crear políticas de vivienda que satisfagan las diversas necesidades de nuestra comunidad. Garcia se dedica a garantizar que todos, independientemente de su origen, tengan acceso a una vivienda segura y asequible.

La experiencia profesional de Garcia se basa en el ámbito de las pequeñas empresas. Durante más de dos décadas, ha estado involucrado en la banca comunitaria y el financiamiento de pequeñas empresas, tanto en el sector privado como sin fines de lucro, donde trabajó tanto para Bank of America como para el banco local latino Plaza Bank y para el desarrollo comunitario sin fines de lucro apoyando a prestamistas de Craft3. Su experiencia práctica le ha brindado una comprensión matizada de los desafíos que enfrentan los empresarios y propietarios de pequeñas empresas locales y los trabajadores para hacer funcionar esas empresas. A Garcia le apasiona aprovechar este conocimiento para crear políticas que fomenten un entorno próspero para los trabajadores y propietarios de empresas.

Garcia también es el único miembro del consejo que ha trabajado en el gobierno local y se desempeñó como Gerente de Desarrollo Económico para el Condado de King durante toda la pandemia de COVID, ayudando a las comunidades no incorporadas en el Condado de King a navegar la reapertura de la economía local y lanzando programas de subvenciones y asistencia que ayudaron. empresas en las comunidades de menores ingresos del condado de King.

Como único inmigrante en el Concejo Municipal, Garcia aporta una perspectiva única a la mesa. Sus experiencias personales al navegar el proceso de inmigración y establecerse en la comunidad alimentan su compromiso de crear una ciudad inclusiva que dé la bienvenida a personas de diversos orígenes. Garcia tiene como objetivo garantizar que las decisiones del Ayuntamiento reflejen las necesidades y aspiraciones de todos los residentes, independientemente de su estatus migratorio

En su poco tiempo personal libre disfruta los deportes y atiende los partidos profesionales de los Seattle Seahawks, Seattle Storm, Seattle Reign, Sounders FC, y viaja a apoyar a los equipos cuando juegan fuera del estado como el aficinado de deportes mas grande del consejo de Burien.

Garcia imagina una ciudad donde la vivienda sea asequible y los trabajadores de las pequeñas empresas sean la columna vertebral de una economía próspera. Está comprometido a trabajar en colaboración con otros miembros del consejo para abordar los desafíos de vivienda e implementar políticas que apoyen el crecimiento de las familias trabajadoras locales. La presencia de Garcia en el Concejo Municipal simboliza la diversidad de nuestra comunidad y subraya la importancia de una gobernanza inclusiva.

 

 *[In English]* 

“The vision of Burien that my parents had when we settled here as immigrants from Guadalajara Mexico in 1991—a community that is welcoming, diverse, and inclusive—is what I still see when I look around our town. It’s a community that opens its arms to all residents in so many different languages. It is a place that supports and loves its small local businesses. It is a place that has shown you can have the values of a small town, without sacrificing on policies that protect the most vulnerable in our communities.”

Meet Councilmember Hugo Garcia, a dynamic and passionate advocate for our community, with a unique perspective as the only immigrant on the City Council. Originally from Guadalajara, Mexico, Garcia's journey to our city has been one of determination, hard work, and a deep commitment to addressing key issues impacting our residents.

Garcia is a strong supporter of affordable housing and the development of small businesses and workers. Having faced the challenges of immigration firsthand, he understands the importance of creating housing policies that meet the diverse needs of our community. Garcia is dedicated to ensuring that everyone, regardless of background, has access to safe, affordable housing.

Garcia’s professional experience is based in the field of small businesses. For more than two decades, he has been involved in community banking and small business financing, both in the private and nonprofit sectors, where he worked for both Bank of America and local Latino owned bank Plaza Bank and later for the community development nonprofit supporting Craft3 assisting lenders finance native and immigrant owned businesses. His hands-on experience has given him a nuanced understanding of the challenges local small business owners and their workers face in running those businesses. Garcia is passionate about leveraging this knowledge to create policies that foster a thriving environment for working families.

Garcia has worked in local government and served as Economic Development Manager for King County throughout the COVID pandemic, helping unincorporated communities in King County navigate reopening of the local economy and launching grant and assistance programs that helped businesses in King County's lower-income communities stay open.

As the only immigrant on the City Council, Garcia brings a unique perspective to the table. His personal experiences navigating the immigration process and settling into the community fuel his commitment to creating an inclusive city that welcomes people from diverse backgrounds. Garcia aims to ensure that City Council decisions reflect the needs and aspirations of all residents, regardless of their immigration status. When time allows, Garcia enjoys sports and attends professional games for the Seattle Seahawks, Seattle Storm, Seattle Reign, Sounders FC, and Kraken. He travels to support the teams when they play out of state as well and considers himself to be the biggest sports fan on the Burien City Council.

Garcia envisions a city where housing is affordable and small business workers are the backbone of a thriving economy. He is committed to working collaboratively with other council members to address housing challenges and implement policies that support the growth of local working families. Garcia’s presence on the City Council symbolizes the diversity of our community and underscores the importance of inclusive governance.
