## Background

 __ *“I ran for office to serve the people of Burien, and I serve in the hopes that I can make a positive difference. I will prioritize intentional growth that respects Burien’s rich history while carefully planning for our future. I am focused on logical and community-led solutions, excited to share what I know, and motivated by a belief in public service and responsibility. Individual action is important, and participation in local governance makes a profound difference in community well-being and in people’s lives. I have never felt more welcome than I do here, and I want that for everyone.”*__ 

Sarah Moore has been a resident of Boulevard Park in North Burien since 2002. While raising her family in Boulevard Park, Moore volunteered at schools, scout troops, sports, and math competitions. Once her kids had grown up, her volunteer roles shifted to other parts of the community. Moore is a former member of the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board, is a founder of Burien’s People for Climate Action group, and is an overnight volunteer at the Hospitality House shelter. Her spouse is a small business owner in White Center, a few blocks from the Burien border.

Her current role as the program coordinator for King County Master Gardeners unites her love for gardening with her passion for informal education. She was the first executive director for Highline Botanical Garden and worked in a temporary isolations and quarantine facility for folks exposed to COVID-19 without secure housing to isolate. For many years, she was the manager of living exhibits for Pacific Science Center.

Moore grew up in Loveland, Colorado and earned her Bachelor of Science degree in biology from Bates College in Lewiston, Maine.

An engaged and curious lifelong learner, Moore is a believer in STEAM education and access to green spaces for all.
