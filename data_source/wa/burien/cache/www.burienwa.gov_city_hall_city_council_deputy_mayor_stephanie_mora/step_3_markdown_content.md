##  Background 

 __ *“Burien is a diverse and rapidly growing city. We have so many great, local businesses that form the backbone of our community and make it alive and vibrant. As a long-time employee at one of our local small retailers, I will focus on being an advocate in City Hall for small businesses. As a mother, I have a vested interest in a safer Burien, especially for children. Everyone deserves a city where they can thrive. I want others to be empowered and help themselves to have a better life in our beautiful, generous community.”*__ 

Stephanie Mora moved to Burien with her family in 2000. She attended Sunnydale Elementary School, Sylvester Middle School, and Evergreen High School and New Start High School simultaneously. Her mother immigrated to the United States and supported her family through a career in cosmetology.

After giving birth to her second child, Mora realized there was a gap in services for new mothers who were living in poverty. In 2012, she began her career as a breastfeeding peer counselor with Open Arms Perinatal Services and Neighborhood House. She is a long-time volunteer at Transform Burien and the Union Gospel Mission. 

Mora works from home while homeschooling five children, two of whom have special needs. 

She enjoys going on family hiking and camping trips as well as creating embroidery pieces for her family.
