## Background

***“I love our city and the residents in our community. I ran for city council to ensure everyone's voices are heard and represented across city government at all levels with respect and thoughtfulness. My goal is to work together with my fellow city council members to create a communicative and supportive system for all residents, business owners, and our own City Staff. By working together, we can do hard things that make Burien a safe, equitable, and vibrant place to live, work, and play.”***

Alex Andrade has lived in Burien for over 19 years where she has raised two children. Andrade owns Citlali Creativo, where she does graphic design and printing for weddings, quinceañeras, and small businesses. She also operates a retail gift shop on SW 152nd Street by the same name. Andrade started this business in late 2008 out of her home, which grew and in 2010 led to opening a physical space here in Burien. In 2022, Andrade moved her business to the downtown core on 152nd with a new retail storefront component.

As a second-generation Latina and member of the LGBTQ+ community, more than 90% of the items Andrade stocks are products made by LGBTQ+, People of Color, other small women-owned businesses, and local businesses that do not have their own physical space. Andrade is intentional in her business practices by representing and holding the door open for others behind her and using her privilege where possible.

Andrade is and has been very engaged in Burien’s community for many years. She is a regular volunteer for Burien CARES and Discover Burien, where she is also a board member. Through these positions, Andrade is involved in most events that occur throughout our city and participates where she can, such as Empty Bowls, Burien Uncorked, Clean Sweep, Hello Again, Taste of Burien, Strawberry Festival, Fourth of July Parade, Drive-In Theatre, Movies in the Park, Olde Burien Block Party, Arts-a-Glow, Oktoberfest/Brat Trot, Boo in Burien, Cookie Crawl, and the many more that come up in between. Andrade has also been on multiple event committees such as Burien’s Pride committee but also B-Town Fiesta where she served as Chair. During her term on Discover Burien and during the pandemic, her board was instrumental in the building of a community makerspace and a community commissary kitchen.

Andrade was born in Orange, CA, lived in Santa Ana, CA until she was five years old, and then moved to Pasco, WA in 1979 where she spent the rest of her youth. Andrade then moved her family to the Seattle area in 1998.

Andrade studied at Columbia Basin College and South Seattle College with a focus on graphic design and studied specialized web development programs through the School of Visual Concepts. In the early 2000s, Andrade learned to code and was able to use those skills to further develop her new business.

Andrade also mentors other small business owners to be successful in their own fields and is able to use her bilingual skills to specifically support Latino small businesses. This includes assistance with filling out paperwork, teaching the importance of marketing, graphic design, and providing translation services. She is also a wedding officiant and has performed many bilingual weddings. Andrade has consistently given herself to serve our community in many ways and will continue to do so.
