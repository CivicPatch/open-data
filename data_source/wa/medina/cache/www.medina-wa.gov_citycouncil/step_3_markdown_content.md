# City Council

The Medina City Council is a seven (7) member elected at large body, and operates under a [Council/Manager form of government](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=35.18.010) as provided for in the [Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 35.18.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=35.18.010). In this form, the City Council hires a [City Manager](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=35.18.060) to act as Chief Executive of the City. The [City Council](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=35.18.160) elects a [Mayor](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=35.18.200) and is the policy and law making body of the City. Council Members not only legislate for the City and establish important policies, but serve as the "board" members of a public municipal corporation having an annual budget of several million dollars and extensive responsibility for maintaining and regulating the public health, safety and welfare.

**VISION STATEMENT**

Medina is a family-friendly, diverse and inclusive community on the shores of Lake Washington. With parks and open spaces, Medina is a quiet and safe small city, with active and highly-engaged residents. Medina honors its heritage while preserving its natural environment and resources for current and future generations.

**MISSION STATEMENT**

Ensure efficient delivery of quality public services, act as responsible stewards of Medina's financial and natural resources, celebrate diversity, leverage local talent, and promote the safety, health, and quality of life of those who live, work, and play in Medina.

**City Council Regular Meetings - 5:00 PM**

The City Council meets on the second and fourth Monday of every month at 5:00 PM and has moved to hybrid meetings, offering both in-person and online meeting participation. In accordance with the direction from Governor Inslee, masking and social distancing will be optional for those participating in person.

**Citizen Participation**

The City of Medina welcomes the participation of its citizens in the public meeting process. Individuals wishing to speak live during the virtual City Council meeting will need to register their request with the City Clerk at 425.233.6411 or email [akellerman@medina-wa.gov](mailto:akellerman@medina-wa.gov) and leave a message before 2:00 PM on the day of the meeting. Additionally, the City Clerk's office will take written comments at any time from distribution of the agenda packet to the completion of the meeting.
