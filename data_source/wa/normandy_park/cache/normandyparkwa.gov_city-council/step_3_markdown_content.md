## A Council-Manager form of government

The Mayor and Council appoint the City Manager, who serves as the Chief Executive Officer of the City organization. The Normandy Park City Council consists of seven members elected to serve four-year terms. The Mayor and Deputy Mayor are selected by the seven members to serve two-year terms. Elections occur every two years during odd-numbered years so positions are staggered. The City Council has the primary responsibility of establishing policy, direction, and goals for the City. The governing laws of the City are adopted by the Council through specific ordinances and are subject to the state laws of the Revised Code of Washington. The City’s ordinances are codified in the Normandy Park Municipal Code.

### **City Council Meetings:**

Regular City Council Meetings are held on the **2nd Tuesday of each month**. Special Meetings are scheduled when needed for the 4th Tuesday of the month. The meetings are held at Normandy Park City Hall in the council chambers.

If you have any questions regarding upcoming meetings please call the City Clerk at (206) 248-8248.

There are no upcoming events.
