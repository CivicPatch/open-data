 __Council Member__ 

 Council Position #1,Appointed in 2024 

  [CouncilPos1@lynnwoodwa.gov](mailto:CouncilPos1@lynnwoodwa.gov)  

 Almaderica Escamilla, known by most of her community, colleagues and friends as “Derica” or “Coach D,” is a first-generation Mexican American born in Moses Lake, Washington and raised in Southern Texas. She graduated from Texas State University, San Marcos in 2004 with a degree in Resource and Environmental Studies and a certificate in Water Resource Management. She is the oldest of three children and the first to graduate from college. Escamilla moved to Washington State in 2005 and migrated to Lynnwood around 2008. Since 2005, she has served on three City of Lynnwood Boards and Committees, starting with the important work done on the Economic Development Advisory Board, followed by the South Lynnwood Neighborhood Co-Design Committee, then the City’s Comprehensive Plan Update. In addition to the city boards and committees, she has also coached basketball at the Alderwood Boys and Girls Club for 12 years and 6 years for the Lynnwood Youth AAU Basketball Feeder Program. She also helped coach the Lynwood High School Boys Varsity and JV teams in the off season when needed. Derica believes the pandemic had a real effect on our youth and sports is one way to help with the social, mental, and physical fallout post-COVID. In addition to coaching, she has also served as the Cedar Valley Community School PSO Vice President for 4 years and continues to assist them and be active where needed in DEI boards, Natural Leaders, and School Fundraising events.  

 She unknowingly started this journey as a kid in student council followed by being high school Freshman, Sophomore and Junior Class President. She also loved being and competing on her high school’s award-winning drill team, where she made captain Junior Year. She says even as a youth something tugged at her to represent those that didn't feel comfortable speaking or those that did not know their opinion mattered or that they even could raise a concern or have an opinion that could be heard. She cares deeply about our youth and our future and wants to be there to drive decisions for the better. She is passionate about all the issues that affect Lynnwood as well as our surrounding communities. Specifically, social and mental health issues, homelessness, drug problems, youth resources, gang violence, affordable housing, and all facets of infrastructure. 

 When she is not at work, Escamilla loves spending time by the water, coaching basketball, watching the Seahawks, going on hikes, mentoring youth and industry, taking long drives, listening to music, golfing, going to concerts and spending quality time with her family. She is also currently the proud Chapter Development Chair of both the National Association of Women in Construction (NAWIC) and Women in Environment (WIE) organizations and has just had the pleasure of chairing the annual state conference for the Association for Learning Environments (A4LE), a K-12 design professional organization. Derica is extremely excited for this opportunity and cannot wait to work for the people. She is bursting at the seams with passion and ready to work.
