 __Council Member__ 

Council Position #6, Elected in 2015

 [CouncilPos6@lynnwoodwa.gov](mailto:CouncilPos6@lynnwoodwa.gov) 

I was born in Seattle, but I grew up in New York on Long Island.  I have lived in Lynnwood for 32 years with my wife. All four of our children are graduates of Lynnwood High School (when it was still in Lynnwood). I have a BA in history/political science from the University of Washington and a MA in American History from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. So, with that educational background it seems logical that I was in the electrical/commercial lighting business for over 30 years...OK, maybe that is not so logical, but life is like that sometimes. But I appreciate my past experiences because I believe that a knowledge of our Countryâ€™s political process combined with my years of business experience provides a solid foundation for serving the public with a focus on sound financial principles. As part of my continuing desire for continually educating myself on city government, in 2021 I earned the Association of Washington Cities Certificate of Municipal Leadership.

I was first elected to the City Council in 2015 and re-elected in 2019 and 2023.  I have been elected Council President by my fellow Council Members in 2021,2022, and 2024. During my three terms on the City Council, I have focused on making Lynnwood a safer place to live and work. I was Chair of the committee that created the South County Regional Fire Authority and I served on the Board that combined two 911 call centers into one efficient 911 system for all of Snohomish County. The challenges of growth management, affordable housing and homelessness are key issues for me.
