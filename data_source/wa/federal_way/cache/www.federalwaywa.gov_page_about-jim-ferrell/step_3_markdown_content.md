# About Jim Ferrell

**​**“We are working to build a community where opportunity thrives.  Federal Way is a place where residents, workers, and businesses can fully pursue their version of the American Dream."**  -Mayor Jim Ferrell** 

Mayor Jim Ferrell believes government works best when it’s guided by the voice of the people.  Always seeking to increase resident access to municipal government and build a more equitable and inclusive community, the Mayor has led successful efforts to improve transparency and community outreach.  By continuing successful programs like Federal Way's Neighborhood Connections and Virtual Town Halls, Mayor Ferrell continually seeks the input of those who call Federal Way home.  

A strong believer in the importance of access to education, Mayor Ferrell has worked with the University of Washington-Tacoma and Highline College to bring a campus to Federal Way through the University Initiative – ensuring scholars have the opportunity to not only grow up in a great town, but also go to college right here in our community. 

His key accomplishments include:

- Creating Town Square Park, a Low Impact Development, which serves as the “beating heart” of our community
- Developing a balanced and objective financial plan to build the Performing Arts &amp; Event Center
- Building the Town Center Steps, connected Town Square Park, the PAEC, and future development while promoting access and walkability
- Advocating for Light Rail to travel down I-5 to Federal Way, growing economic opportunity, and ensuring downtown redevelopment through Transit Oriented Development
- Converting to LED streetlights and beginning Federal Way’s conversion to an electric vehicle fleet
- Withdrawing from the SCORE Jail System, saving the City more than $4 million
- Deploying increased resources to keep neighborhoods safe from graffiti and chronic distressed properties![](https://www.jimferrell.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/D529F057-266B-46F7-8B89-8A759D369F31-190x300.jpg)
- Securing [the donation of the historical Brooklake Community Center property](https://www.federalwaymirror.com/news/254629101.html) to the parks department
- Dedicating Downtown’s 60-foot flagpole and designating [Veterans Way](https://www.federalwaymirror.com/news/282327961.html)
- Saving [public health services](https://www.federalwaymirror.com/news/279936702.html) for more than 13,000 low-income women and their children
- Creating a structurally balanced 2025-26 budget.
- Supporting small businesses during the pandemic by signing more than half a million dollars worth of CARES Act Grants
- Convening the Mayor’s Homelessness Task Force and acting on recommendations to help create the Pete Anderson FUSION Family Center, helping serve over one hundred families in need per year
- Ensuring greater oversight of the Federal Way Police Department, discontinuing use of chokeholds, and working toward a body camera program
- Creating the [Shop Local Federal Way](https://shoplocalfedway.com) website to help support Federal Way businesses by encouraging residents to shop local.  It is also a great directory of businesses in Federal Way.

In addition to the efforts above, Mayor Ferrell believes government works best when it’s guided by the voice of the people.  He introduced several efforts to increase resident access to their municipal government.  With improved transparency and community outreach efforts like the well-attended Neighborhood Connection meetings and the "New Day Federal Way" program on Channel 21, our community has many new ways to connect with their City.
