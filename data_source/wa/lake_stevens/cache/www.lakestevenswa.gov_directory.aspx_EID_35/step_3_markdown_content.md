 __ __ Biography__ 

  ![Anji Jorstad](images/182691b201bf621f17f4f7ff04b15afb27dd9d8d78f07bb2ce7002291a0a7a2e.png)__ Anji Jorstad is a Pacific Northwest native. Born in Washington and raised in Eastern Oregon, she was drawn to the natural beauty of Snohomish County in 1993 to pursue her career in community mental health. Anji and her husband, Jesse, moved to Lake Stevens in 2011, excited to raise their family in a tight-knit, friendly community with a distinguished school district. They have two boys, one attending school in Lake Stevens and one living in Bellingham.

Anji is a graduate of Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon with a double major in Psychology/Social Work. She earned her master’s degree in social work from Eastern Washington University and is a Licensed Social Worker with experience in both the public and non-profit sectors. Anji currently works for Snohomish County as a Behavioral Health Supervisor in the Human Services Department, overseeing innovative programs that bring law enforcement, corrections, behavioral health and housing systems together to address service gaps throughout Snohomish County.

Anji brings over 30 years of experience engaging in community organizing, project development, and budget oversight within Snohomish County to the work of the Council. She is committed to creating opportunities to bring the ideas in our community to City Hall, where open dialogue and transparency are necessary to move us forward.

Anji spends her free time with her husband and family cooking delicious meals and discovering new restaurants, playing card and board games, and finding new ways to enjoy Lake Stevens and the Pacific Northwest.
