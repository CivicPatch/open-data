Washington natives Steve and his wife Athena, have been happily married since 2000, and have been in Lake Stevens since 2005. They were won over by the excellent schools coupled with its proximity to recreational and employment opportunities. Each of their five children are/have been blessed to have received their education within the Lake Stevens School District.

Steve graduated from college and began his career with the State of Washington in 2002. He has worked as a Mental Health Counselor, Community Corrections Officer, and has served many years as an Administrative Hearings Officer in both the prison and community settings.  Steve finds his service oriented professional work both rewarding and challenging.

Serving his community and others has long been part of Steve’s life. He served a two-year mission for his church to Milan, Italy, and has served in many church leadership positions since. He has also served many years as the President of his 136 member Homeowners Association.  Prior to joining the City Council in 2019, Steve served on the City’s Planning Commission for two years. Steve is a regular blood donor and is proud to have his 8 gallon pin!

In his free time Steve loves to garden, and hikes in the gorgeous mountains that surround us. He is proud of his fig trees and other garden produce that he and his family enjoy every season.
