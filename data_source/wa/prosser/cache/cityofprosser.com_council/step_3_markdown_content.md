# Mayor &amp; Council

## Overview

The City operates under a Mayor-Council form of government with seven elected Council Members serving 4-year terms. Citizens are always welcome to come and participate in City Council Meetings. Meetings are routinely held on the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of every month and begin promptly at 7 pm. City Council also conducts a work session on the 1st Tuesday of each month beginning at 7 pm. The adopted [Council Goals and Priorities](https://cityofprosser.com/DocumentCenter/View/463/Council-Goals-and-Priorities-PDF) of the Prosser City Council serve as the long-term vision for the City, and from those goals the Council establishes its priorities. Having goals and priorities that accurately reflect Council's position is vital for effective operation of the City. Goals that do not align with Council's position creates inconsistency and delays in the implementation of Council's priorities.
