# City Council

The City Council is elected to serve four-year terms. At the beginning of each year, the Council elects a Mayor Pro-Tem to serve a one-year term as Council President, presiding over Council workshop sessions, and serving in the mayor's temporary absence. Council Meetings are on the second and fourth Monday at 7:00 PM in City Hall. Council Workshops precede the Council Meetings at 6:00 PM. Meetings are also streamed live on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@CityofAlgonaWa).
