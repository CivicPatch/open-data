# Dave Olson

## Mayor

Phone: 253-952-3299  
Term Expires: December 31, 2027  
[Email Dave Olson](mailto:dave.olson@cityofedgewood.org)

Born and raised in Puyallup, Dave spent most of his childhood living up on South Hill. Shortly after getting married, he and his wife Cheryl moved across the valley to the better hill, the North Hill, in 1992 where they bought their first home. Then in 1995, that “better hill” incorporated into the City of Edgewood where Dave and Cheryl proceeded to raise four daughters - Robyn, Adria, Emily, and Bethany.  

Dave’s career was in Medical Device sales where he spent 37 years selling various products into O.R.’s and surgery centers throughout the Pacific Northwest. Back in 2005 he chose to run for City Council and eventually served two terms until completing his civic duty in 2013. Then, after being away from city politics for 10 years, he decided to jump back in and run for Mayor. His motivation was a simple desire to serve others. His 4-year term began on Jan. 1st, 2024.  

Back in 2014, the voters in Edgewood passed what is known as a “Strong Mayor” form of government where the Mayor is elected to a 4-year term by the voters, instead of being appointed by the City Council for a 2-year term. Previously, a City Manager had served as the chief executive officer of the city, but with this new form of government, the Mayor now runs the administrative branch. Furthermore, while Dave presides over the City Council meetings, he does not have a policy vote except in specific cases of a tie-breaking vote when there is no direct financial matter at stake. He also has veto authority as specified in the city charter. 

An avid hiker, Dave has logged countless miles hiking all over this beautiful state we live in, and has his eyes set on someday conquering the 93-mile Wonderland Trail.  He’s also a hopeless Mariner’s fan but is questioning if he will live long enough to ever see them win a World Series. Dave set up his own tropical fish tank at his office in City Hall and has an Arowana named Griffey. 

After having survived (barely) a medical scare back in 2016, Dave was challenged by one of his doctors to get back out there and to “Go live your life”. He has done just that ever since and welcomes anyone to join him on a hike, or stop over to share a pizza from his wood fired pizza oven, or join him on a medical mission trip to a 3rd world country. It’s an open invitation.  #goliveyourlife
