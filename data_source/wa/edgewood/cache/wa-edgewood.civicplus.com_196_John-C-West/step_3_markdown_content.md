# John C. West

## Position 5

Term expires: December 31, 2025  
[Email John C. West](mailto:jwest@cityofedgewood.org)

I have served on the Edgewood City Council since 2017, and on the planning commission for 10 years prior.  In my experience here I have helped develop and foster a highly functioning government, that is now cloud based and more efficient than before I joined.  And I’ve provided critical and commonsense legislation and oversight of all aspects of government, from writing and passing municipal code, ordinance, zoning, evolving operations and approving budgets that collectively have improved the functions of Edgewood Government from planning and public works to community development and code enforcement.  I’ve learned and exercised well the municipal and public hearing process to gain insights and collect input from citizens which I use to make sound decisions for the citizens of Edgewood. 

I am a lifelong resident of the East Pierce County area (Fife, Milton, Edgewood &amp; Sumner) graduating from Fife High School in 1987 and have owned my residence in Edgewood since 1996.  My wife and I raised our children here and now are enjoying watching our grandchild grow up here.  We support FME youth sports (formerly a Jr Football and Soccer coach), Mountainview Community Center, Nourish Food Banks, Fife Booster Club, Step By Step, Big Brother and Big Sisters, United Way of Pierce Co, St Jude’s Children’s Hospital, Thrive Center Life and several other non-profit community organizations.

I am a passionate believer in community.  The heart of our community is our people, and I work hard to listen and appreciate our people, their dreams, ideas and concerns.  Each life experience has value and I work hard to support our shared social compact.   I serve on council because I love my community and care about how we grow.  Like you I am concerned about the rapid growth in our city and all the associated problems including traffic, increased density and the impacts on infrastructure, and environment.  I have a simple litmus for every decision:  The right outcome must fit city’s vision for future and maintain a safe and healthy ecosystem.  In each decision brought to council, I ask myself, how do I as a citizen think about this?  What is the impact to public safety, the individual property owner, the retired couple, or the new family just starting out?  What about the interests of small businesses?  It’s really that simple.   

I have more than 20 years’ experience in Business Operations Management.  I hold certifications in Performance Excellence and Statistical Quality Control from American Society of Quality. I’m a Licensed Kepner Tregoe Practitioner and Sr. Quality Engineer.  I earned an MBA from Seattle Pacific University and Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.  I am a Veteran of the US Navy with overseas service (Japan, Korea, Guam) that included patrols in the US 7th Fleet (Western and South Pacific) during the Gulf War.  I am also a Lifetime member of the VFW.
