I love Gig Harbor. I am committed to working hard to keep it an amazing place to live, work, play and raise a family. I believe in a community that welcomes everyone with respect and compassion.

Our downtown home is so peaceful yet near so many small businesses, parks, and the waterfront. I love that people say hello when they see each other on the street. I am committed to listening to anyone who wants to chat and to weighing everyone’s opinion before each vote.

It’s important we work together to connect neighborhoods with bike paths and walking trails while maintaining and growing our critical infrastructure. It’s also important we have an overarching long-range plan to help guide our decision making in the coming years. Strong public/private partnerships will continue to be critical to continue improving the city we all love by building projects like the sports complex and a community center.

After raising our two boys in Alaska and supporting my husband’s Air Force career, I am thrilled to be home in the Northwest.

I serve this community by listening to as many stakeholders as possible and then making sound decisions to protect its quality of life, character and heritage.
