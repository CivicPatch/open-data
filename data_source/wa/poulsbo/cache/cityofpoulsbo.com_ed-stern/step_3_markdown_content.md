* * *

I am serving my seventh consecutive term on the Poulsbo City Council. In January 2024 I was elected unanimously to be Deputy Mayor.

My professional background, I started after college as a teacher in Special Education in Montana. I then changed careers to be community development Director for the City of Livingston Montana  (1978-1986), before finally moving to Poulsbo in 1986 and becoming a Financial Advisor and managed over time for three different brokerage offices here before retiring in 2019.

In terms of public service, I have sat on the Board of the Kitsap Economic Development Alliance (KEDA) from 1987 to present.  I chaired for KEDA the immensely productive Regional Telecommunications Committee, when the work shifted over the Kitsap Regional Coordinating Council where I have co-chaired its Broadband Task Force. I served on the Kitsap County Commissioners appointed Base Reduction and Closure Committee (BRAC) to help safeguard our very important military bases, which we accomplished. Appointed by the Washington State Legislature to the ‘High-Speed Internet Strategy Working Group’ in Olympia in 2008. I was elected to serve the 281 city-member Association of Washington Cities (AWC) Board of Directors and also served as president for the AWC in Olympia. I also serve on the Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC), in Seattle, as past-president and current board member representing Kitsap cities for the Federal Economic Development District.

In 2020 Governor Inslee appointed me to the State Public Works Board, where I currently chair the Broadband Committee.
