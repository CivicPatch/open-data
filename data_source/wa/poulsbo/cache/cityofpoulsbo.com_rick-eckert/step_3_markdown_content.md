* * *

Originally from Pennsylvania, I entered the Navy in 1994 and spent 20 years serving my country.  I served in a variety of duty stations in Florida, California, Virginia, Maryland, Washington, North Carolina, the United Kingdom, and Afghanistan as well as the 5th and 7th Fleets.  I moved to Poulsbo in 2008 to finish out my Naval career and retired in 2015 at which time I began service as a Federal employee working for the Navy in records and policy management.

I have been an active member of my community wherever I have called home; participating in Parent-Teacher Associations, community volunteerism, and community relations activities overseas.  Since making Poulsbo my home, I have been regularly engaged in the city, county, and community. I am an active member of the Poulsbo Post of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and a strong advocate for improving services city and county-wide for veterans.  I believe strong community makes a strong city and look forward to continuing to serve my community as a member of the city council.

My wife Kelly and I have been married since 1995 and have two adult sons and a feisty Norwegian Buhund named Freya.
