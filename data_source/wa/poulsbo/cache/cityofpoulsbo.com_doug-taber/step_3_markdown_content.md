Hello! I started my service on the Poulsbo City Council on April 3 2024, where I proudly serve as your City Councilmember Position 6. 

My professional background started in Government and Public Service with an internship at a political consultant agency in Sacramento in 2013, and then representing graduate students interest at the University of Washington from 2013 to 2015 as both Senator and Treasurer. I worked for multiple non-profits after Grad School, primarily performing budget reconciliation and policy strategy. In 2016 I landed in the private sector working as an analyst at a Washington-based Bank. In 2019 I started work at Amazon where I was excited to apply my policy-skills to complex technical problems Amazon faced as it launched multiple arms of business in new countries across the globe. After over 8 years away from public service, in 2024 I began looking for opportunities to solve complex problems at the local level. 

I am very passionate about public and community service, and public policy. In under-grad I dedicated myself to studying policies and programs to eliminate poverty, including a specialized semester at the University of Geneva in Switzerland. I moved to Seattle for Graduate school in 2013 where I focused on finding policies to reduce the K-12 dropout rates in public schools (including presenting our findings to the Mayor’s office). I am currently a Volunteer member of Evergreen Mountain Bike Alliance, and Fishline (in Poulsbo). I am a strong proponent of the individual’s role to contribute positively, whether it be politically, socially, within one’s family, or within one’s workplace; While also maintaining integrity, challenging narratives, and one’s own beliefs and opinions. 

I look forward to serving the community, and working on behalf of my fellow Poulsbohemians.
