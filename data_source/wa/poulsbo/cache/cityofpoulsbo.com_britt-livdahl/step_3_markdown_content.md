My roots in Poulsbo run very deep. I’m passionately committed to this beautiful place we call home.

As a council member, my goal is to help Poulsbo grow thoughtfully, while finding the balance between retaining our unique heritage, and promoting responsible economic development. I want to see Poulsbo strive to become a model for other communities by utilizing innovative concepts in affordable housing, environmental sustainability, pedestrian and bike friendly streets, robust public transit, emergency preparedness, and the creation of engaging common spaces. By promoting inclusivity, and supporting people of *all* ages and backgrounds, we can create a vibrant community and enjoy a high quality of life, together.

A 29-year resident of Poulsbo, I grew up folk dancing at the Sons of Norway, sailing on Liberty Bay, and marching in the Viking Fest parade. Today, I’m a creative entrepreneur, real estate broker, and successful small business owner with my husband, Jason. Past positions in the service sector allowed me to connect daily with the community, and recent work in digital marketing and branding provided insights into the complexities of local businesses, and forged relationships with proprietors. I’m a volunteer with the West Sound Wildlife Shelter, and I formerly served on the City of Poulsbo Lodging Tax Advisory Committee.

I’ve been fortunate enough to travel throughout our nation, and the world. This global perspective has solidified my gratitude and appreciation for Poulsbo, and has compelled me to personally invest in our future by running for public office. I recognize that while I cannot reflect everyone’s individual experience or background, I *can* be an ally and support those who’ve been marginalized or feel unheard. I will practice active listening, and grow from the collective knowledge and culture that our citizens offer.
