* * *

Kitsap first became my home 30 years ago when I had the opportunity to serve on a submarine. I quickly recognized our community’s unique qualities – the people, environment, and the economic opportunities. After experiencing diverse cultures around the world with the Navy and private industry, I returned to Kitsap in 2014 with my wife and daughter.

Doug is married to Audrey Newell.   Audrey is a local realtor helping people find homes in our community.  Our daughter, Geneva, is a North Kitsap High School graduate who recently finished her studies in civil engineering.  Geneva initiated and held Poulsbo’s Day of Positivity in 2019.
