# City Council

### The Legislative Mission Statement

Our City’s Council endeavors to balance residents’ concerns and opinions with the law. The Council establishes the priorities of the City along with setting policies and a budget to allow the Mayor and Department Heads to run day-to-day business effectively and efficiently.

Council positions are not defined by geographical areas (districts). All seven councilmembers represent the whole city.

[Click here](mailto:councilmembers@cityofpoulsbo.com) to email all City Council members.

**Please Note**: The Open Public Meetings Act prevents the city council from responding to e-mails as a governing body in which final action will be discussed or taken.
