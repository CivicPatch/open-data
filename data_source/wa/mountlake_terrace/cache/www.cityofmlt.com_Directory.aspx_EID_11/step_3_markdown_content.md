# Rick Ryan

 

[City Council](https://www.cityofmlt.com/Directory.aspx?DID=9)  
Title: Councilmember  
Phone: 425-977-9232  
[Email](mailto:Rryan@mltwa.gov)

Rick and his wife Judy have lived in Mountlake Terrace the past twenty-eight years. They have two sons, one a graduate of Mountlake Terrace High and the other an honor student at Gonzaga.

Appointed to City Council in February 2008, Rick brings an enthusiastic willingness to serve and a varied, well-balanced background and experience to play a leadership role in his community.

A graduate of Bishop Blanchet High School, Rick earned his Bachelor of Arts Degree in Music Education from Seattle Pacific University and his Masters Degree in Administration and Curriculum from Gonzaga University. He also earned a Certificate of Ornamental Horticulture from Edmonds Community College. Rick also received an Advanced Certificate of Municipal Leadership from the Association of Washington Cities.

Currently, Rick is an elementary school teacher with the Mukilteo School District and a past Scoutmaster for Boy Scout Troop 35. He enjoys the outdoors and working with youth. He has also been active in Tour de Terrace festivities.

Besides his own qualifications, Rick has also gained from growing up in a family steeped in political experience. His father, Thomas Ryan, was a career public servant, serving as King County and Washington State Parks Director and as Deputy King County Executive under Governor John Spellman. Rick, along with six brothers, experienced firsthand the excitement of public service, having attended many public events with his family. Two of Rick’s brothers are currently serving in government, one in the executive and the other the judicial branch.

“Investing in the welfare of our youth is the best way of insuring Mountlake Terrace of a prosperous future,” Rick explains. His experience makes him especially suited for working with the city’s youth and being involved in their needs and interests.

Rick currently serves as City Council liaison to the Arts Advisory Commission and the Library Board.
