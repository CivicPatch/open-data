# Laura Sonmore

 

[City Council](https://www.cityofmlt.com/Directory.aspx?DID=9)  
Title: Councilmember  
Phone: 425-967-1975  
[Email](mailto:Lsonmore@mltwa.gov)

Laura was appointed to the City Council in 2000, elected for the remainder of the term in 2001, and re-elected in 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015. Currently she is the longest-tenured Councilmember.

She is employed by The Boeing Company. She was raised in Mountlake Terrace, attending Mountlake Terrace High School. Laura has a Bachelor’s Degree in Law and Justice from Central Washington University with a minor in psychology. She also earned a paralegal degree at Edmonds Community College where she served as Student Body President and received the Community Distinguished Alumni Award in 2004. She also received an Advanced Certificate of Municipal Leadership from the Association of Washington Cities.

In 2011, Laura was elected as President of the Snohomish County Cities Association by the elected officials of Snohomish County and served as an officer of the Association since 2002. She currently serves on the city’s Finance Committee and SNOCOM Board. She remains as one of the city’s three representatives on the Regional Fire Authority Planning Committee, and alternate to Snohomish County Health District Board. 

She and her daughter Ashley completed a 9-week Citizens Police Academy offered by the Mountlake Terrace Police Department to learn more about public safety and how she can better serve the community. One of her goals is to preserve additional park space.

Since 2007, Laura has traveled to Washington, D.C. with the Mayor and City Manager and met with federal delegates to request financial assistance for much needed infrastructure improvements that has resulted in over $10 million in state and federal funding from 2008 to present.
