## **City Council Goal**

The goal of Bonney Lake City Council is to give citizens the opportunity to participate in the process of government and help our community achieve its full potential. Among its primary duties, the City Council makes laws, sets policies, adopts regulations and budgets, levies taxes, controls the finances and property of the City, authorizes public improvement, provides for public safety and health, forms boards, commissions and agencies; and oversees a wide-ranging agenda for the community.

### **Authority Of Council To Determine Rules**

The Bonney Lake City Council, in accordance with state statute [RCW 35A.12.120](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=35a.12.120 "RCW 35a.12.120 Link") shall determine its own rules and order of business, and may establish rules for the conduct of council meetings and the maintenance of order. They shall be in effect upon adoption by the council and until such time as they are amended or new procedures adopted in the manner provided.

### **Procedural Policies**

Action taken not in compliance with these rules, but which is otherwise lawful, shall not invalidate such action or be deemed a violation of law. These procedural policies are designed to assist the council and councilmembers in performing their duties and not to provide additional substantive rights or duties above and beyond that otherwise already established by state law. Failure of the council to follow any of these rules shall be deemed a council decision to waive such rule, and no notice of such waiver need be provided prior to such waiver.
