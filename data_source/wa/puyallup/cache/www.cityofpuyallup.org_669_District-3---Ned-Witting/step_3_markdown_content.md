 1. District 3 - Ned Witting

# District 3 - Ned Witting

 Ned Witting was elected in November 2019 for the 2020 - 2023 term, representing District 3. In November 2023, Councilmember Witting was re-elected to his position, serving a term 2024 - 2027. 

## Personal Information

 

 Ned and his wife Karilee have been residents of Puyallup for over 20 years.  All four of their children graduated from Puyallup schools, two as Rogers Rams and two as Emerald Ridge Jaguars.  Professionally, Ned earned a CPA and an MBA, and has served as a controller and chief financial officer.  As a business entrepreneur, he and his partners purchased Valley Press, across from the train station in downtown Puyallup in 2002 and renamed it Print NW.  In the ensuing years they grew its revenues 10-fold.  He is the author of Political Gridlock:  It’s Time for a Reboot , a book that discusses how to bridge the partisan gulf that is dividing our country. He is committed to listening to opposing viewpoints, building consensus and working to find common ground.   

## Service to the Community

 

   

 Ned has served in the Boy Scout organization for almost 40 years including as a scoutmaster, District Committee Chairman, board member and Membership Chairman of the Pacific Harbors Council.  He has served his church in a variety of leadership positions for a similar time period.  Other leadership positions include service on the Leadership Council of the NFIB, the Pierce County Homelessness Steering Committee, as board member of the League of Women Voters of Tacoma-Pierce County, as Puyallup’s representative on the Pierce County Regional Council, Rainier Communications Commission, and South Sound Housing Affordability Partners and as State Coordinator of Better Angels, and State Volunteer Coordinator for NoLabels. He has also served on a number of Puyallup and Sumner School District Committees. 

## Objectives

 

 Ned brings a wealth of financial experience to the Council and will work to help Puyallup maintain a sound financial footing.  An immediate challenge is to provide the Police department with the space it needs to service our community without unnecessarily burdening taxpayers.  He is also committed to building the economic vitality of Puyallup and making it easy for businesses to create living wage jobs here in the city.  While he supports development he is committed to building the infrastructure to support it and maintaining our quality of life.  He is passionate about developing a comprehensive plan to address homelessness in Puyallup that will allow us to simultaneously reduce the suffering of those experiencing homelessness and ensure the safety and security of our community and children.  To accomplish these goals he will work with all council members to find common ground and solutions that are compatible with other viewpoints.
