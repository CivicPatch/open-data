# Deputy mayor - Dennis King

Dennis King was elected in 2021 for the 2022 -2025 term. In 2024, he was selected by Council to serve as Deputy Mayor for 2024 - 2025.

**Personal Information**

Dennis and his wife Melinda have lived in Puyallup for over 35 years. They have chosen Puyallup to raise their two young children. They own and operate King Family Fun Center (Skate Tiffany’s) which has been a community staple since 1969.  After the roller rink caught fire in September 2020, they decided to serve our community in another capacity and now own/operate their real estate business, The Dennis King Home Team.  Choosing to pivot and work hard towards a new goal has given them new energy and commitment to Puyallup.

**Service to Community**

Dennis has been involved in serving the community since early childhood.  He has served with the Kiwanis Club since 2013 and taking over his late father’s seat for 30+ years.  He has served as President of Puyallup Kiwanis for the 2017-2019 term leading the Club in overall membership in the Pacific Northwest.  He has been a part of bringing the Kiwanis Spray Park and Imagination Station to our Library. He has recently served as a Civil Service Commissioner from 2020 to 2021 and enjoys helping where he can by finding new avenues to support our community.  He and his wife felt called to step up and run for Puyallup City Council in early 2021 and ran a hard-fought campaign to win District 2.

**Objectives**

Dennis has committed to supporting our Police and Emergency Services by promising to never defund those who risk their lives to protect our community every day.  He promises to uphold the values and generous influence of our city.  He is motivated to encourage more responsible economic growth in our downtown corridor and invites more affordable real estate options into our city.
