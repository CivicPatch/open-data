Lauren grew up in downtown Puyallup, attending Frutiland Elementary and Aylen Junior High before graduating from Puyallup High School in 2007. After graduation, Lauren attended Pierce College Puyallup where she served as Student Body President. 

 

 Lauren knows that Puyallup needs a safe streets, a thriving downtown, and leaders who show up and listen.

Given Lauren’s deep roots in our community, she knows Puyallup’s rich history and unique heritage. She is committed to preserving and protecting the city’s charm while keeping an eye to the future.

 

Councilmember Adler has spent over 20 years working in government. In fact, she has worked at every level of government – local, state, and federal. This is where she learned first-hand the importance of being a problem solver as well as creating and implementing smart, common-sense policies. From 2013-2020, Lauren served as a senior advisor to former Congressman Denny Heck. In this role, Lauren advised the Congressman on issues impacting Puyallup and worked to connect our local communities directly to Congress. In 2022, Councilmember Adler was recognized by South Sound Business as one of their “40 Under 40” honorees for her government relations work throughout the South Sound. Today, Lauren works full-time as a Government Relations Director in the utility industry.

 Councilmember Adler believes that more than ever we need leaders with civility, decency, respect towards one another, and the ability to work with each other to get things done. These are all values she pledges to bring to the council.
