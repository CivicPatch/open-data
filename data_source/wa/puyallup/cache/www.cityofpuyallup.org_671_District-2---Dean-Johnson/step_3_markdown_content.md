# District 2 - Dean Johnson

Dean Johnson was first elected in 2015 and re-elected in 2019 as the At-Large member of the Puyallup City Council. In this role, he was the only Council member elected by voters citywide, uniquely positioning him as the only Council Member to represent residents across all three districts.

Dean also served as Mayor of Puyallup from January 2022 to January 2024, where he championed initiatives that strengthened the city's economic growth, public safety, religious freedom, and holistic community engagement.

In 2023, Dean was re-elected to a third consecutive term, receiving overwhelming community support that set citywide historical records in broad-based endorsements and financial contributions. He was also the only candidate in his race to receive public endorsements from both Democratic and Republican elected officials. Dean’s longstanding political motto—*“People first, party second”*—has resonated deeply with Puyallup residents, fostering unity and common sense across political divides.

**Personal Information**

Councilmember Johnson and his wife, Deborah, have three grown children and three grandchildren. He earned his M.A. from Faith International University and Seminary in Tacoma. In addition to his public service, he is a seasoned real estate professional specializing in both residential and commercial properties. His extensive career also includes serving as a pastor in several Pierce County churches and as a top-performing Personal Stylist at Nordstrom.

**Heritage**

Dean Johnson’s election to the Puyallup City Council echoes a longtime family heritage of five generations that have lived in Puyallup dating back to the City’s founding in 1890. His great-great-grandfather, Perry Summerfield, was a prominent member of Puyallup’s early pioneer community who served on the very first city council alongside Ezra Meeker.

**Guiding Principles &amp; Objectives**

Council member Johnson is committed to respecting all people and collaborating with his fellow elected officials, city staff, and citizens to advance Puyallup’s well-being. His key priorities include:

- **Public Safety** – Councilmember Johnson is a well-documented, steadfast supporter of the Puyallup Police Department. He prioritizes data-driven community safety initiatives and actively opposes 'well-intentioned' but politically driven policies that lack basic common sense and as a result, compromise the safety of residents and businesses!
- **Community Engagement** – Believes that a vibrant and healthy city is a direct result of intentional engagement with every segment of stakeholders within our city on a holistic basis.
- **Animal Welfare** – No household pets or wild animals deserve to be treated inhumanely, abused, or in conditions that cause undue suffering.
- **Homeownership** –Advocates for affordable homeownership opportunities, enabling first-time buyers, single adults, young families, and seniors to own smaller-footprint homes rather than rent.
- **Freedom of Speech** – Defends the right of all individuals to express their beliefs openly and without suppression.
- **Core American Values** – Affirms that all people are “created equal” and “are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”…and that we are “one nation (and one city) under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all”

**Personal Quote**

During his speech after taking the oath of office as Mayor of Puyallup, Councilmember Johnson shared the following personal remarks:

*"May God bless you, your families, and your businesses...May God bless your dreams, your ambitions, and your futures...And may God bless our city, the City of Puyallup at a level of which we have never seen before in our 132-year history.”*
