A Message from Mayor Harrell
----------------------------

![Mayor Bruce Harrell](https://www.seattle.gov/images/MayorHarrell/Home/headshotwebcrop.jpg "images/MayorHarrell/Home/headshotwebcrop.jpg")

Seattle is a global destination and leader in industry, innovation, and creativity. As your Mayor, I am committed to uniting our diverse communities around shared priorities and meaningful progress on our biggest challenges. Through our focus on a back-to-basics approach like restoring public safety, helping people move indoors, keeping parks open and welcoming, and fixing potholes, we can build a strong foundation and bright future for our city and our families.

We recognize change does not come quickly or easily. But improvement is possible if we act boldly, intentionally – and together. We can change the course of our city if we are willing to work collaboratively, to turn common ground into common cause, to think – and act – big.

That’s my vision for ***One Seattle***, to turn our city’s pioneering spirit into progress, I hope you’ll join me in creating the Seattle we all want to see.
