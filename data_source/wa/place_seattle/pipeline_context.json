However, recent election results indicate that Katie Wilson has been declared Mayor-elect and Erika Evans has defeated Ann Davison for City Attorney. These individuals are expected to take office in early 2026. The Seattle City Council has nine members, with seven elected by district and two at-large. Municipal Court Judges are also elected positions."
