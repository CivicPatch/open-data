# City Council

Clyde Hill's five-member City Council functions as the City’s legislative body. Tasked with providing policy direction, enacting legislation, and approving a biennial budget, the City Council plays a pivotal role in shaping Clyde Hill's governance. City Councilmembers are elected at large to staggered four-year terms. 

The City Council crafts and adopts governing laws for Clyde Hill through specific ordinances, adhering to Washington State Laws as outlined in the [Revised Code of Washington](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw). These laws are encapsulated in the [Clyde Hill Municipal Code](https://www.codepublishing.com/wa/clydehill).
