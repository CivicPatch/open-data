The monthly Council Meeting is the forum for updates on City actions, citizen input, Planning Commission recommendations, and Council deliberation. The Mayor and Council serve elected four-year terms and are nominally paid for the Council Meeting.

Planning Commission will be holding their meetings on the 2nd Monday of every month from 5:30pm to 6:30pm. Meetings are held at the Mossyrock Community Center  219 E. State St.

Please contact City Hall 360-983-3600  or by email: clerk@cityofmossyrock.com at least 7 days prior to scheduled meeting, if you wish to be added to the agenda.
