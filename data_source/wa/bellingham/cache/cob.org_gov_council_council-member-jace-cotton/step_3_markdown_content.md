# Council Member Jace Cotton

![](https://cob.org/wp-content/smush-webp/image.jpeg.webp)

**At-Large**  
**Term: Jan 2024 – Dec 2025**

**Phone:** (360) 778-8214  
**Email:** [jacotton@cob.org](mailto:jacotton@cob.org)

In my first year serving on Bellingham City Council, I chair the Community and Economic Development Committee and serve as a member of the Climate Action and the Parks and Recreation Committees.

I also serve as the council representative to the Community Development Advisory Board, Whatcom Marine Resources Committee, Bellingham Airport Advisory Board, Port Marina Advisory Committee, and Immigration Advisory Board.

As the first openly gay elected official in Whatcom County, and as the only renter on City Council, I am committed to an inclusive approach to getting things done.

Over the years, I’ve been privileged to work with inspiring groups of workers, renters, retirees, parents, and educators. Most recently, I led the successful effort to raise the minimum wage and protect tenants after extreme rent increases. Previously, I led the campaign to count every vote to pass the Healthy Children’s Fund and local efforts to ensure a pro-labor, pro-climate action and pro-choice legislature.

The stories of friends and neighbors hurting in a local economy growing more unaffordable are why I continue to feel called to this work. Low-wage workers and retirees whose rent won’t stop climbing. Young parents who need second jobs to afford childcare, groceries, and housing. As a former public K-12 paraeducator and pandemic grocery worker, I know many of these challenges personally.

As your At-Large City Council Member, I look forward to working with you to make our city a better place.
