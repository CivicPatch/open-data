# Council President Hollie Huthman

![Holli​e​ Huthman](https://cob.org/wp-content/smush-webp/p950131-1-320x400.jpg.webp)

​​​​​**​Represents: Ward 2**  
**Term: Jan 2022 – Dec 2025**

**Phone:** (360) 778-8216  
**Email:** ​[hahuthman@cob.org](mailto:hahuthman@cob.org)

I deeply value having a community welcome to all, and also one where those who make this a unique and wonderful place to live can afford to live. My passion to serve focuses on helping to create a City with affordable housing for every resident; in decreasing incarceration while increasing prevention and alternatives to the traditional justice system; and, encouraging an active small business and creative-industry rich economy.

I’m a WWU graduate with a degree in Sociology with an emphasis in Criminology, co-own a downtown live music venue, and play in a local band. I have lived in eight different Bellingham neighborhoods, all but one of those as a renter. 

Additional boards that I serve on include Bellingham/Whatcom County Tourism, the Bellingham Tourism Commission, Downtown Bellingham Partnership, Sustainable Connections, and Whatcom Transportation Authority (WTA). I’ve also served over five years as a board member of Make.Shift Art Space.
