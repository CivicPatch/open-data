​​​​​​ __Represents: 1st Ward__ 

 __Term: Jan 2024 – Dec 2027__ 

 __Phone: __ (360) 778-8211

 __Email: __  [hestone@cob.org](mailto:hestone@cob.org) 

## City Council

On October 1, 2018, I was appointed by a unanimous vote of the sitting Council Members to fill the at-large position left vacant when Roxanne Murphy resigned. On November 5, 2019, I was elected to serve as the Ward 1 Representative.

I currently serve as the Chair of Public Works and Natural Resources. In 2023, I served as Mayor Pro Tempore. In 2021 and 2022, I served as President of the City Council, Chair of Finance, and as a member of both the Police Pension Board and the Firefighters Pension Board. In 2020, I served as President Pro Tempore and Chair of Climate Action. In addition, I served for more than three years as liaison to the Immigration Advisory Board (2019 – 2022).

As an elected official, I also serve as a member of the Opportunity Council’s tripartite Board of Directors (2020 – present).

## A Call to Serve

 *“Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.”* 

– Martin Luther King Jr.

My family and I have always been engaged in the community. Individually and collectively, we provide volunteer hours and a helping hand to our friends, neighbors, schools, non-profit organizations, and local businesses whenever possible. Bellingham is our home, and we have a vested interest in the health and wellbeing of the entire community.

I am mindful that my service in public office is a privilege. The issues facing the City Council are issues that matter to me, my family, and our community – affordable housing, shelter and services for the unhoused, economic development, education, and the environment.

The City Council is responsible for setting public policies, adopting long-range plans, approving the budget and taxes, and passing laws that benefit and protect all residents of Bellingham. However, the high quality of life that Bellingham purports to offer is not currently accessible to all who live and work in our fine city. There is important work to be done and I am ready to roll up my sleeves, reach out to residents, and engage with the community. As a council member, I aim to be responsive to concerns and transparent about the process.

 *“It always seems impossible until it is done.”* 

 *– Nelson Mandela* 

## Education & Employment

I obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in International Studies and Spanish Language from Meredith College in Raleigh, North Carolina, and a Juris Doctor degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Law. I have been a solo practitioner and Bellingham small business owner since 2007. As an active member of the Washington State Bar Association (WSBA) in good standing, my practice focuses solely on U.S. immigration and citizenship law.

## Family

My husband and I relocated to Bellingham, WA from Chapel Hill, NC in May of 2005. We rented homes in Sudden Valley and the Sunnyland neighborhood before we were fortunate to purchase our first home in December of 2014. We have spent the past eight years renovating our small fixer upper, and the work continues.

Our daughter is in 9th grade and our son is a senior at Bellingham High School. My mother moved to Bellingham more than 12 years ago to be closer to her grandchildren and rents a small 600 sq ft home next door.

I feel fortunate to be able to live and work in Bellingham. My family enjoys exploring this corner of the Pacific Northwest – from the slopes of Mt. Baker to the islands across the Bay. We are proud to call Bellingham home!​
