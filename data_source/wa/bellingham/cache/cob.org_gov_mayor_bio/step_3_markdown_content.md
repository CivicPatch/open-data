Mayor Lund knows that cities have an important role to play in addressing the complex environmental, social and economic issues of our time. She believes that City Hall can, and must, act with urgency, intelligence, and courage to not only meet today’s challenges, but to proactively shape our shared future. 

Mayor Lund is a Bellingham Public Schools alumna and mom, and a graduate of the University of Washington. She has been a team leader at Intel Corporation, a small business owner, and executive director at the Bellingham Public Schools Foundation. Mayor Lund holds a Leading Sustainable Corporations certificate from the Said School of Business at Oxford University.
