# Council Member Edwin H. “Skip” Williams

![](https://cob.org/wp-content/smush-webp/Skip-Williams-2024-1.jpg.webp)

Edwin H. “Skip” Williams

**Represents: 4th Ward**  
**Term: Jan 2022 – Dec 2025**

**Phone:** 360-778-8215  
**Email:**[ehwilliams@cob.org](mailto:ehwilliams@cob.org)

More than 30 years ago I moved from Tacoma to Bellingham and have called Ward 4 my home.  I am a 3rd generation Washingtonian, I’ve raised my family here and I want my children to be able to work here, raise their families here and live in a place where they can be proud of who they are.

A strong belief of mine is that service and involvement are essential for community growth and development. Problems are solved through informed discussion, thoughtful deliberation, and civil interaction leading to long-term, sustainable solutions. Public service is the greatest privilege I can have to help solve the needs of our community

I have benefitted from serving on many nonprofit boards such as Northwest Youth Services, Whatcom Crisis Services, The Pipeline Safety Trust, The City Club of Bellingham, and The Mount Baker Theatre.  I participated in and served as a trainer for the Leadership Whatcom Program where I gained an appreciation of the interconnectedness of issues and institutions; the value of learning as a community; and the integration of study, planning, action, assessment, and adjustment.

Bellingham continues to grow and with growth our city faces increasingly difficult challenges including homelessness, economic development, affordable housing, and racial and social justice. This is important work and as a Council member I stand ready to address these needs and work towards sustainable solutions that will meet the needs of all of our community. Our work must be based on a vision of the kind of place we want our city to be and what role we as Bellingham City residents are willing to play to make that vision a reality. When you are involved and responsible you sit at the table, work through the issues, and come to realistic, long-lasting solutions.

These are the principles that I will continue to follow and adhere to as a member of the Bellingham City Council, working with my colleagues and our community. Initially as a Council member I will be serving on the Planning Committee, Public Health Safety, and Justice Committee, and chairing the Parks and Recreation Committee. Also, I will serve as an ex officio liaison to The Parks Advisory Board, The Greenways Committee, The Lake Whatcom Policy Group, The Open Space Committee, The Bellingham School District Board of Directors, and the Mount Baker Theatre Board of Directors.

In the words of Representative Jim Clyburn:

*“You might not be totally happy with the final result but if you have done your best to get us where we need to be, you have done your job.“*
