​​​​​ __Represents: 5th Ward

Term: Jan 2024 – Dec 2027__ 

 __Phone: __ (360) 778-8217

 __Email: __  [​laanderson@cob.org](mailto:laanderson@cob.org) 

When I began my first term in 2020, my first year was not at all what I would have expected. With an international pandemic taking hold early in 2020, many of my first-year goals shifted to address the pandemic and financial stability for the city and our community. We did advance a few goals in 2020: apprenticeships for large city contracts (finalizing in 2021), addressing our need for a long-range restorative plan for Whatcom Creek (on our 2021 agenda), funding for housing entry and houseless outreach (increased budget by $1.5 million in 2021-22), investigating public fiber (advisory group has been formed) and a Dig Once ordinance (expect consideration in our first quarter). This year, I chair the Planning Committee, and serve on the Public Works and Natural Resources Committee and the Parks and Recreation Committee. I will also represent the City of Bellingham on the governing boards for the Chamber of Commerce, Port Marina Advisory Committee, Museum Foundation, Open Space, the Working Waterfront and Airport Advisory. ​I will continue to outreach with local unions to support our trades, laborers, and local workforce.

Bellingham has been my home for over thirty years, and I have been a resident of Bellingham’s 5^(th)  Ward for over twenty-two years. Since moving to Bellingham from the county, I ​have volunteered in our community. As a York Neighborhood Association Board member, I provided leadership and community building from 2009 to 2015. As President of YNA, I partnered with Sehome Neighborhood Association’s President Harriet Spanel to successfully improve the safety and vitality of the Samish Way Corridor. I helped champion rental registration to ensure healthy and safe residential rentals. Additionally, I served on the Mayor’s Neighborhood Advisory Commission.

In January 2016, I was appointed to the Bellingham Planning Commission and served on Bellingham’s Shoreline Committee. As a Planning Commissioner, I collaborated to find pathways to support smart growth that does not ignore the voice of our neighbors and business leaders. As a City Councilor, I will continue to lead with collaboration and respectful communication. I will work for all members of our community with divergent views and work hard to find the middle ground to help lead Bellingham forward.

My priorities will focus on providing solutions for our environmental, housing, and employment needs while maintaining a focus on fiscal responsibility. I am committed to long range planning for growth that protects our environment, clean water from Lake Whatcom to the Salish Sea, economic development, municipal improvements, provide housing and mental health services, livability and our sense of place that makes Bellingham a wonderful place to call home.

I am an alumnus of Whatcom Community College and earned my bachelor and M.Ed. from Western Washington University. I am a proud AFSCME union member employed full time at Whatcom Community College serving our community members to reach their educational goals. Family, especially my grandchildren, have been instrumental in my desire to work for a better community and future.  My life has been focused on serving our community, and I look forward to expanding that service as your City Councilor.​
