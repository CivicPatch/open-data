[City Council](https://www.libertylakewa.gov/Directory.aspx?DID=8)  
Title: City Council Position 5  
Phone: 509-847-5522  
[Email Annie Kurtz](mailto:akurtz@libertylakewa.gov)

**Term expires:**  December 31, 2027  
   
I was born and raised in Montana and spent time living in Oregon and Colorado before moving to Liberty Lake in 2011. My husband Dusty and I are kept busy with our two young daughters, Callie and Brooklyn. We can often be found enjoying community parks, camping in our vintage 1960 trailer, enjoying the Farmers Market, and supporting local restaurants.

 

**Education**

I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in sociology and justice studies, and a master’s degree in health and human development from Montana State University.

 

**Volunteer Experience**

I have been a volunteer in my daughter’s classrooms and at school events, served as a member of the PTO, and I have chaired several committees in my neighborhood. I have also volunteered at a local neonatal intensive care unit with the Eat Sleep Console program to hold and console infants who were born drug exposed.

 

**Professional Experience**

I have been a public servant for more than 20 years in city, county, and state government. I currently work for the state of Washington's Department of Children Youth and Families as a permanency outcome facilitator, where I facilitate meetings between the department, attorneys, treatment providers, youth, caregivers, and families with the goal of engagement of families and achieving timely permanency for children.

 

Prior to this, I served as a regional program manager for Children’s Administration, representing 13-20 counties in eastern Washington. In this role, I found a passion for public policy, evidence-based programs, data analysis, budget and contract administration, and advocating for equitable solutions and resources for small and larger urban counties.

 

I am committed to developing partnerships with the people that I represent, taking time to understand the intricacies of the community, the short and long term direct and indirect impacts of decisions, and remaining steadfast in my advocacy. I really enjoy meeting people and am committed to finding new ways to engage residents in the decisions that affect our small community. To that end, I proposed a new Community Engagement Commission for Liberty Lake, and the council approved the resolution to form this new citizen commission. I look forward to the work the Commission will do to sustainably and consistently engage our neighbors and neighborhoods in the decision-making process within our community.

 

Several of my areas of focus include: engaging residents, listening, advocating, offering critical evaluation of current policies, procedures, and budgets, understanding the impact of the Council’s decisions, and making balanced recommendations and decisions that strengthen our community.

 

As always, I would be happy to meet with community members and those who contribute to our community through service and/or business. I look forward to hearing from you.
