[City Council](https://www.libertylakewa.gov/Directory.aspx?DID=8)  
Title: City Council Position 1  
Phone: 509-979-1979  
[E-mail Linda Ball](mailto:lball@libertylakewa.gov)

I’m originally from Anchorage, Alaska, but I moved to the “lower 48,” as Alaskans call it, in 1996.  I still love Alaska, but not so much the long winters. After time in the Coeur d’ Alene area and Seattle, I settled in Liberty Lake for the quiet, beautiful scenery, and proximity to family across the border.  I intend for this to be my last stop, so I am invested in this community!

Please know that I am here for you.  I ran for this office to be ears and eyes for the citizens.  I am a people person and enjoy meeting new people.  I want your thoughts on keeping Liberty Lake clean, sustainable, welcoming to all and prosperous. Call or email me for coffee!

**Term:**  Jan. 1, 2024, to Dec. 31, 2027

**Education**

• B.S in communications, Lewis-Clark State College, 2005  
• Real estate school in Alaska and many hours of continuing education in the real estate field.  I earned my certified residential specialist credential.

**Professional Life**

• I was a real estate professional from 1981 to 2001; 16 years in Alaska and four years in Idaho.  
• Journalist/reporter from 2001 to 2021, both in Idaho and Washington.  I worked at the Spokesman-Review, Coeur d’Alene Press and Sound Publishing, and did freelancing.  
• Currently I am a program assistant at Greater Spokane County Meals on Wheels, which is very gratifying, in addition to serving on Liberty Lake City Council. 

**Volunteer Experience**

• Big Sister for Big/Brothers Big Sisters  
• Idaho Press Club  
• President of two different homeowner’s associations (one in Idaho, the other in Seattle)  
• Southwest Seattle Historical Society  
• Anchorage Historical Society  
• Volunteer for GSC Meals on Wheels prior to becoming staff  
• Participant in Mardi Bras, which benefits Volunteers of America's Hope House, Spokane
