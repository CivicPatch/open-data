**Term:** January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2025

Councilmember Cargill is a sixth-generation eastern Washingtonian and has a family history here that dates back to the 1800s. He is related to the namesake of our city – Stephen Liberty – and is the great-great-great grandson of one of the “Lake Men” – Daniel Courchaine. Courchaine, along with Stephen Liberty, William Newman and Chief Seltice of the Coeur d’Alene Tribe, [worked together to settle our area.](https://www.spokanevalleymuseum.com/2018/09/meet-the-lake-men "https://www.spokanevalleymuseum.com/2018/09/meet-the-lake-men/")

Councilmember Cargill is a graduate of Central Valley High School and Gonzaga University, completing a degree in broadcast communications and political science. 

He worked in television news in Spokane for 10 years before entering the think tank world in 2009.  IN 2022, he became founder, president, and CEO of the Mountain States Policy Center.. 

He is a father of two boys – Lincoln and Hudson – and husband to Lisa, who works at Itron’s Liberty Lake headquarters.  

Councilmember Cargill is committed to focusing the city on five key areas: 

- Priorities of government budgeting
- Strengthening law enforcement
- Bringing new restaurants and businesses to the area
- Transparency in all city functions
- Rejecting tax increases used for anything other than core functions of government.

Councilmember Cargill served the city on the Planning Commission in 2021 and is a local youth baseball coach. He is well-known for his column in local newspapers and his guest appearances on radio stations across the region. 

When not serving on the council, you can find Chris spending time with family at the lake, embarking on a new home improvement project at the Liberty Lake Home Depot, or shopping for produce at the Farmers Market.  

Councilmember Cargill encourages all citizens to be involved in the City Council’s actions and will always consider feedback from those in the community before making any votes on the council.
