**Living in Liberty Lake:**    
My husband and I moved to Liberty Lake in 1994 along with our three children.  We have made so many incredible memories within this community, having been married for 42 years and now with 10 grandbabies.  Like most, we saw some needs and set out to fulfill them by doing the research to asking the community what they needed, which has set the tone since.  There was a BP Gas station on the corner when we moved here and a cluster of homes being built within the master planned community.  With new neighbors, ideas of what was needed and a canvas to create upon we joined the forces of others to make Liberty Lake a unique place to live, work and play.

I love this community and want to represent it well, so hearing your voice is important.  My first and foremost goals are for transparency, to pool our resources together for those services we can not do on our own (such as public safety, parks, roads, and library services), and to keep taxes low while providing for the services we all need.  

Please feel free to give me a call or drop me an [email](mailto:wvanorman@libertylakewa.gov).
