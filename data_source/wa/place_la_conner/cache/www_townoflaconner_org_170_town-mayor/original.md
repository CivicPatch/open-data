Town Mayor
==========

From the Desk of the Mayor
--------------------------

Hello and welcome to La Conner, Washington! Our majestic little town is located just over an hour north of Seattle, in the heart of Washington’s enchanting Skagit Valley. Whether you’re here to relax or for business, we hope you enjoy our little piece of this place we call home.

La Conner is known for creating inspiration of all types, its picturesque views, and friendly people. It’s a town where vibrant art, scenic landscapes and warm hospitality converge.

Whether you’re wanting to visit the magic of the daffodil and the tulip fields in early spring, enjoy adventures on land or water during the summer, relish in the quiet tranquility of our history and art museums in the fall, or even to just enjoy the lights and festivities of the Holiday season, I invite you to visit. Come explore our charming streets and shops, take a stroll along the Swinomish Channel on the Boardwalk, and take in the beauty that surrounds you! Be sure to explore Pioneer Park near Rainbow Bridge, a vital connection to our Swinomish tribal neighbors, savor Pacific Northwest flavors, and immerse yourself in the beauty of the fertile Skagit Valley.

We’d love to share a little slice of our town and its unique charm with you – a place where moments become memories. Your journey begins here.

 Wishing you all the best,

Marna Hanneman, Mayor
