## **Form of Government**

The City of Soap Lake operates under the Mayor-council form of government. In this form, the elected mayor serves as the City’s chief administrative officer, and an elected seven-member council serves as the City’s legislative body. Soap Lake is a Code City form of government.

**Legislative Powers:**

The City Council exercises the legislative powers of city government, including adopting the annual City budget, ordinances, and resolutions.

- **Other Responsibilities:**
  
  Setting appropriate tax levies, establishing sewer and water rates, setting other general tax and service rates, Mayoral veto override authority, and setting the Council agenda.

### RCW [**35A.12.030**](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=35A.12.030)

### Eligibility to hold elective office.

No person shall be eligible to hold elective office under the mayor-council plan unless the person is a registered voter of the city at the time of filing his or her declaration of candidacy and has been a resident of the city for a period of at least one year next preceding his or her election. Residence and voting within the limits of any territory which has been included in, annexed to, or consolidated with such city is construed to have been residence within the city. A Mayor or councilmember shall hold within the city government no other public office or employment except as permitted under the provisions of chapter [**42.23**](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.23) RCW.

\[ [**2009 c 549 s 3006**](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5038.SL.pdf?cite=2009%20c%20549%20s%203006); [**1979 ex.s. c 18 s 20**](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1979ex1c18.pdf?cite=1979%20ex.s.%20c%2018%20s%2020); [**1967 ex.s. c 119 s 35A.12.030**](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1967ex1c119.pdf?cite=1967%20ex.s.%20c%20119%20s%2035A.12.030).]

## Legislative Process and Policymaking

City councilmembers serve as the legislative branch and have several key [roles and responsibilities](https://mrsc.org/explore-topics/officials/roles/roles-and-responsibilities), including passing laws, establishing policies, and conducting hearings. **Councilmembers do not have authority over city administration or most personnel decisions**, which are left to the mayor or city manager, depending on the form of government. City councilmembers should resist the temptation to intervene in administrative matters.

Councilmembers must follow certain procedures to enact legislation and establish policies, culminating with public meetings where they vote on individual ordinances, resolutions, and motions.

Ordinances typically refer to permanent laws and rules of conduct, such as establishing laws, prohibiting certain activities, or setting salaries for particular offices. Resolutions are typically less formal and usually set out the council’s opinion on a special or temporary matter. However, some items may be adopted by ordinance or resolution. Motions are similar to resolutions and direct the council to take a certain action.

For a [resolution, ordinance, or motion](https://mrsc.org/stay-informed/mrsc-insight/july-2022/taking-action) to take effect, it must be approved by the city council with a quorum (minimum number of councilmembers) present. The quorum requirements are established by state law. The number of votes required to pass a measure depends on the classification of the city or town, the size of its legislative body, and in some instances, the nature of the legislation. For details, see MRSC’s publication on [Local Ordinances](https://mrsc.org/getmedia/44e20d0f-a536-473f-baac-bd7504323330/Local-Ordinances-For-Washington-Cities-And-Counties.pdf?ext=.pdf).

Each city council is also responsible for setting its own [rules of procedure](https://mrsc.org/Explore-Topics/public-meetings/Procedures/Rules-of-Procedure), including items such as the agenda-setting process and desired [parliamentary procedures](https://mrsc.org/Explore-Topics/public-meetings/Procedures/Parliamentary-Procedure). Check with your clerk to see what formal rules have been adopted by your council.

## **Mission**

The council’s mission is to provide effective City government representation for its citizens, determine policy, enact ordinances and resolutions, approve contracts and authorize the payment of all obligations incurred by the City. After reviewing the administration’s revenue estimates and expenditure requests, it is the responsibility of the council to adopt an annual budget.

**Prior Council Minutes and Current Agenda will be posted 24 Hours before the next Council Meeting.**
