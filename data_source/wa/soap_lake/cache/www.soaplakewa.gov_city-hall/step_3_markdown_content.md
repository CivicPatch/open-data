# City Hall

City Hall is committed to supporting the Soap Lake community by providing exceptional and innovative financial services. Our primary goal is to ensure accountability for all public funds, assets, policies, and systems in the most effective and efficient way possible. We aim to optimize the use of our limited resources while delivering responsive, high-quality customer service to our citizens and colleagues.

The role of the City Clerk, Deputy Clerk, and Utility Clerk involves a wide range of services that support various City Departments, and the residents of Soap Lake, Washington. Key responsibilities include coordinating the preparation of materials for City Council meetings, facilitating public notifications, and accurately producing meeting minutes. Additionally, City Hall manages requests for public records and processes payments, ensuring a comprehensive approach to community engagement and service delivery.
