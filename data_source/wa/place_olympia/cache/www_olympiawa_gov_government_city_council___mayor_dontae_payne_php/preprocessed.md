Dontae Payne, Mayor
===================

![Payne-2022](https://www.olympiawa.gov/revize_photo_gallery/Government/City%20Council%20&%20Mayor/Payne-2022.jpg)

Mayor Dontae Payne was elected mayor in November 2023 and was elected to the Olympia City Council in November 2021. Professionally, he has served as a Regional Representative and Senior Policy Advisor for Civil Rights & Racial Justice in the Washington State Office of the Governor, as Deputy District Director in the U.S. House of Representatives, and he currently serves as the Equity & Community Partnership Manager for the Washington State Department of Revenue. He’s also a former board member on the Olympia Hands On Children's Museum's Board of Directors.  Payne is the first Black American and openly gay person elected or appointed to the office of mayor in Olympia’s 164-year history at the time of the election.

Payne was born and raised in Philadelphia, and his family later relocated to Allentown, Pennsylvania, where he attended high school and joined the U.S. Army. He moved to Olympia in 2014 after being stationed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. He and his husband Jason are raising their 8-year-old daughter, Priscilla, along with their cat “Minnie” in Olympia’s westside.

Payne earned a Master of Public Administration degree and a Bachelor of Arts degree from The Evergreen State College in Olympia following his service in the U.S. Army.  He served on active duty in the United States Army for six years, with two tours to Logar Province, Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. He re-enlisted to serve for two additional years in the U.S. Army following his initial enlistment and separated from the Army in 2016.

Payne is focused on improving Olympia by working towards a more housed, safer, cleaner, and greener city. He and the City Council continue to adopt solutions on the following policy areas:

* Enacting equitable policies to address systemic discrimination and barriers to access in all the work of the City, particularly with the assistance of the Social Justice and Equity Commission.

* JBLM Representative – Alternate
