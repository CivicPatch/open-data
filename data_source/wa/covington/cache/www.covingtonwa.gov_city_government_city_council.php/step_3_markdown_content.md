HOST A COUNCIL MEMBER![NNO1](https://www.covingtonwa.gov/NNO1.jpg):

What better way to learn about what's going on in Covington than to meet with city council members in person? Your city council would love to join you and other Covington residents, neighbors, businesses, and local organizations to talk about what is important to you as a member of our community. Public involvement and feedback are essential to our city’s progress, so please reach out to us and make your voice heard!

If you would like to host a council member for a discussion, please contact us at the information below. All you need to do is gather your group and find a meeting location, and we will send a council member to you. Get your neighbors to join you in the driveway for a casual conversation, and we will be there. Or ask your HOA if they would like a council member to attend one of their meetings for some Q&amp;A. Own a Covington business? We can stop by to chat with you and your staff or even meet you for coffee. Let us come to you—we want to hear what you have to say!

COUNCIL BIOS:  
**Kristina Soltys - Position #1**

I have been a resident of Covington for 17 years, along with my family, and a Councilmember since 2020. I am a proud member of the Covington community and am passionate about giving back to it. A healthy and wholesome city is made up of healthy and wholesome individuals, and that is important to me. I am committed to building “in-house resources” for residents, such as locally based and accessible social services, to help Covington thrive. I also look forward to my role in helping to shape and guide Covington’s future as a destination city that supports a vibrant local economy through a diversity of services, strong infrastructure, and recreational appeal, while always keeping true to the heart of Covington—its community of engaged and caring residents.

I hope to see more residents respond to council, attend meetings, provide input, and ask questions because it means they are invested and contributing to Covington’s future. That may look different for each home or individual but the state of our resident’s being–and that means physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual–is critically important, and I want to continue to create encourage ways for our residents to be active, social, and engaged

**Jennifer Harjehausen - Position #2**  
My husband and I have been married over 20 years and are thrilled to be raising our four kids here in Covington. I have degrees in Marine Biology and Molecular Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology, and work as a Project Manager for a clinical trials laboratory.

I have served in leadership positions on numerous non-profit boards in our community, including our schools’ PTSAs and our local preschool, Covington Co-Op. I served as Chair of the City’s PRePAC Committee and served on the City’s Arts Commission and Planning Commission. I’ve also enjoyed serving on various committees supporting the efforts of Kent School District, including the Family Engagement Task Force and Citizens Budget Review Committee.

I am humbled and truly honored to have been Covington’s 2018 Citizen of the Year. Working with and building relationships with other people committed to making our City great has been an extraordinary gift. As our city grows and new businesses and more people come to our community, I look forward to fostering and cultivating more relationships to build an even stronger, safer, and greater city.

My goal is to provide our residents the community they desire and deserve.

**Debby Hartsock - Position #3**

![DebbyFinal](https://www.covingtonwa.gov/DebbyFinal.jpg)I have enjoyed living in Covington since my husband and I moved our family here in 1999.  I have witnessed amazing growth in what our city has offer.

After a 30 year career as a senior leader in the IT Managed Services industry I made a decision to retire early and began seeking out where I could utilize my time and skills to help others through organizations supporting our community and beyond.

I have been fortunate to serve on a variety of boards and regularly volunteer my time serving in our community.  My volunteer involvement includes:

- Covington Rotary Club (board member)
- Covington Storehouse Foodbank (board member and active volunteer)
- Covington Chamber of Commerce (active member)
- Clean, Safe, Welcome Committee (active member)
- Kent Guild of Children's Hospital (past president and active member)
- Covington City Councilmember

Through serving in these organizations I have been awarded the opportunity to meet many of our neighbors, gain valuable relationships, understand the wide variety of needs and help to provide vision and solutions.

I am honored to bring together my leadership experience, organizations skills and love for our community to serve on your City Council with a vision for a safe, fun and vibrant city.

**Joseph Cimaomo, Jr. - Position #4**  
I was born in California and moved to Washington in 1991, I have lived in the Covington area since 1998, and am a graduate of Kentwood High School. Before being elected to the Council I served as the Vice Chair for the Covington Budget Priorities Committee. I am married and have two sons.

I want to see our council continue to strive to make Covington better. I am looking forward to seeing the new development at the Hawk Property being built. I am also looking forward to developing long term solutions for our roads.

**Sean Smith, Mayor Pro Tem - Position #5**  
![1647576463523](https://www.covingtonwa.gov/1647576463523.jpg)In 2005, my wife and I moved our family from San Francisco to the Puget Sound area after I accepted a position with a national non-profit. When we considered a place to make our home, we researched and visited countless communities looking for a combination of good schools, safe neighborhoods, diverse residents, natural settings, access to mass transit, and affordable housing.  We found all these things in Covington!

From the day I moved here, one of my priorities has been to get involved in the community’s future. Along that line, I’ve volunteered in my children’s schools, on city commissions, and on local ball fields.  Specifically, I have worked on the Covington Planning Commission and its Budget and Priorities Advisory Commission. For my planning commission service, I received the city’s 2010 Commissioner of the Year Award. I have also served as an Art Docent and a volunteer Science Coordinator at Covington Elementary. I even stepped up and coached a few of my kids’ basketball and baseball games.

My time in Covington has taught me that communities and cities benefit when its citizens take an active role in shaping its destiny. I am honored to serve the citizens of Covington on their City Council.

**Elizabeth Porter - Position #6**

I have lived in Washington since 1980. I grew up in Yelm and after graduating from college in Bellingham with a degree in finance, I moved to King County and have never left. I have lived in Covington since 2004 with my husband Mike, drawn here by the close proximity to a natural environment and close access to both the mountains and the Puget Sound. My professional background is 26 years in retail management and the past two years as a retail operations project manager.

In August of 2020, I was appointed to City Council position #6, to fill the vacancy left when Councilmember Fran Hollums retired. Prior to my appointment to the council, I served for three years on Covington’s Planning Commission, with the last two years as co-chair. I have been on the Green River Community College Business Advisory Committee since 2007, a member of Camber Outdoors and Washington Trails Association and also belong to the Covington Rotary Club. Together with my husband, we volunteer at the Storehouse Foodbank and the Elk Run Farm in Maple Valley. 

While out canvassing in Covington during the 2019 election, I had the opportunity to meet some wonderful fellow residents! Over the next 14 months, I would like to continue with this type of personal engagement so that we can all feel valued and go along on the journey to build a vibrant and safe community full of cultural activities, shopping, restaurants, alternative commuting options, and places where we can come together and connect while enjoying the natural beauty that I believe makes Covington special.

I have also been involved with Reach Out Covington, Children's Miracle Network Telethon and I was voted Kiwanian of the Year in 1993. Previously, I have served on the King County Flood Control District Advisory Committee, Kent Chamber Board of Directors, King County Growth Management Planning Council and was selected as the 2014 Covington Citizen of the Year.
