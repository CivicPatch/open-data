# Vic Kave, Mayor

Welcome to the City of Pacific

 

I wish to thank you for the honor of serving you as your Mayor.  A little about me, I was born in October of 1968 but not in Washington and like all kids I had no control over that.  I was born in the small town of Berkeley Springs, West Virginia, which is known for its medicinal spring water visited by many famous people including our first President, George Washington.  During the 70’s stagflation, my father owned an electrical business and had issues with folks paying their bills for services rendered.  So one early summer weekend, in 1975, we packed the truck up and started driving north into Canada for a much needed vacation.  Then we trekked westward and when it was time for school to start, we would settle down.  That just happened to be a suburb of Portland, Oregon.  I spent my 2nd through 4th grade years there.  Then my dad got homesick and we moved back to West Virginia in the summer of 1978.  I graduated from high school in 1986 and enlisted into the Army a few months later. 

My first assignment in the Army was with the Ranger Battalion at Ft. Lewis.  There I grew up and that experience had a tremendous influence on who I am today.  I held various assignments in the Army and topped off my military career as the team leader of the Special Reaction Team on Ft. Lewis (their version of SWAT).  I left the Army in the summer of 1992.  While in the Army, I met a girl from Auburn and the rest is sort of history as I chose to stay here and build a life with her.  Washington is a beautiful state with many outdoor opportunities if you can ever get used to the rain (I still haven’t gotten used to it but made the best of it).  Soon after leaving the Army, I got hired by the Auburn Fire Department which is now the Valley Regional Fire Authority. 

After becoming a firefighter, I bought a house here in Pacific in 1993, got married and raised 2 boys who graduated from Riverside High School.  After nearly 30 years of service, I retired in June of 2022 from the Valley Regional Fire Authority.  As many of you know, I served as a council member for the last 10 years prior to becoming your mayor.  I believe that all of my combined life experiences have prepared me well for the role that you have bestowed on me.  I need you to realize that I did not run for office out of some deep need for attention but because I truly believe that I can help bring this city into the modern era while keeping our small town feel.  I hope to exceed your expectations but I can’t do it alone.       

My whole adult life has been committed to public service.  During that time I have learned to listen to the needs of our community as well as our nation.  Pacific, just like every other city, is facing new and unique challenges that we have never faced before.  What I know in my heart is that with your help, we can rise above these challenges and become stronger together.  However, it is going to require us to do whatever it takes to make that happen. 

I have gone around town and looked at some of the decisions from the past and wondered what was the vision?  I found no clear answers and I can’t change what was done before me.  Moving forward, I will make decisions with a vision for the impacts on our future rather than just react to the present situation.  You should know that I am a person of principle with clear moral character and passion for doing things right.  This has caused me to ruffle some feathers along the way.  I am human and capable of making mistakes but know that if I am ever wrong, I will admit it and change direction to get things right.  I will fight passionately for the needs of our community.  So know this, when I come to you for help, whether it be for volunteers to help build a sense of community while saving the city money or for an increase in taxes to improve infrastructure like our streets, it is with humility and a great sense of moral responsibility because we truly need what I am asking for. 

With your help, I have every confidence that we will rise to the challenge and overcome any obstacle standing in our way.  I know this to be true because we still smile at each other when we're out-and-about around town.  We still stop and have conversations and offer help to those in need.  We still care about our neighbors.  We are still the City of Pacific.  This is our city.  We need to protect it and build on what we have.  Pacific can be a true gem.  I’m so optimistic for our future and so incredibly honored to serve this community with integrity and passion.  Thank you for putting your trust in me.

 

In Service,

Vic Kave

Your Mayor
