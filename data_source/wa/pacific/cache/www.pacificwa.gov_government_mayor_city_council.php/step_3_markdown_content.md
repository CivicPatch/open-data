Our Form of Government

The City operates under the Mayor-Council form of government authorized by Chapter 35A.12 of the Revised Codes of Washington (RCW). The City Council, as the legislative body of the City, is responsible for passing ordinances and resolutions, adopting the budget, appointing committees and adopting goals and general policies. The seven council members are elected for four-year, staggered terms.

The mayor is elected directly by the citizens of the City and is the chief executive officer of the City. The mayor, through department directors and staff, implements city policies and conducts regular business of the City. The mayor takes an active role in regional governmental coordination, economic development, and disaster preparedness. He also serves on the governance board for the Valley Regional Fire Authority, a provider of fire services within the City of Pacific.

The City Council utilizes the [City Council Rules of Procedure](https://www.pacificwa.gov/Documents/Government/Mayor%20&%20City%20Council/Resolution%20No.%202022-852%20Council%20Rules%20of%20Procedures.pdf) to outline a method of conduct for their activities.

Committee of the Whole/Sub-Committees

The Council is currently investigating a Committee of the Whole approach to sub-committees in order to be able to discuss upcoming issues and items that need to be addressed before Council. The Committee of the Whole items are presented under the headings of Finance, Public Works, Public Safety, Human Services, and Technology. Committee of the Whole meets the first and third Mondays before the workshops - contact the City Clerk for information at 253-929-1105. 

The Mayor appoints, with Council approval, members of various [Boards and Commissions](https://www.pacificwa.gov/government/boards_and_commissions/index.php) which serve as advisory bodies for legislative issues.
