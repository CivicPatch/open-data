| Tim Schmitt  - February, 2022 | Tim Schmitt, City Council Position 7 **Phone:** 360-629-2181   **Term:** 2022 to 2025   [Email Tim Schmitt](mailto:tim.schmitt@stanwoodwa.org)   Biography I am a northwest native. I earned a Bachelor of Science degree, in computer science, from Western in 1989, and an MBA from Seattle University in 1998. I started my career in computer security, working for such clients as Bank of America and the Central Intelligence Agency. Then, in 2001, I started my own small business, which I operate today. I think we're all fortunate to live in a town as wonderful as Stanwood, and I am honored to serve it as a council member. |
