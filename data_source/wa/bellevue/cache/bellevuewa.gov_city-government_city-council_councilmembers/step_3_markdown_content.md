Seven councilmembers, elected at-large, serve staggered four-year terms. The councilmembers, in turn, select a mayor and deputy mayor from among themselves. A councilmember will serve as mayor or deputy mayor for a two-year term.

The council sets the general policies of the city, which are implemented by the city manager and staff. As your representatives, the councilmembers are available by telephone, mail or email.

To schedule time with a councilmember, please contact the Council Office ([counciloffice@bellevuewa.gov](mailto:counciloffice@bellevuewa.gov) or 425-452-7810).
