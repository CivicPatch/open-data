Mayor's Office
==============

The city of Cheney is a thriving community of 13,160 full-time residents, and is located just 17 miles southwest of Spokane. Our quality of life is unmatched because of our small town atmosphere and family-friendly environment.

Incorporated in 1883, Cheney's history contains strong ties to education, rail lines, and agriculture.

Cheney is the home of Eastern Washington University, a comprehensive public university situated on 300-acre park-like campus grounds. The Cheney School District encompasses grades Kindergarten - 12th grade, and is well known for its academic and sports programs.
Outdoor recreational opportunities abound in the Cheney area, such as fishing, boating, biking, hiking, and camping. Just south of Cheney is the Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge, a unique area of wetlands, grasslands, and forests, where you can see a variety of birds, waterfowl, and other forest dwellers in their natural habitat.
We are proud of our city, and are confident that we truly have something to offer everyone.

Mayor-Council Government
------------------------

Cheney has an elected mayor (elected at-large), who serves as the city's chief executive officer, and a city council (elected at-large), which is responsible for formulating and adopting city policies.
The mayor-council form of government is characterized by a separation of executive and legislative powers and a system of checks and balances patterned after our traditional national and state governments.
The mayor and council members serve on a part-time basis, leaving most of the day-to-day operations to full-time administrative personnel.
