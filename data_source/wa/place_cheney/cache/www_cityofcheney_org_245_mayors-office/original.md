Mayor's Office
==============

The city of Cheney is a thriving community of 13,160 full-time residents, and is located just 17 miles southwest of Spokane. Our quality of life is unmatched because of our small town atmosphere and family-friendly environment.

Incorporated in 1883, Cheney's history contains strong ties to education, rail lines, and agriculture.

Schools
-------

Cheney is the home of Eastern Washington University, a comprehensive public university situated on 300-acre park-like campus grounds. The Cheney School District encompasses grades Kindergarten - 12th grade, and is well known for its academic and sports programs.  
  

Recreational Opportunities
--------------------------

Outdoor recreational opportunities abound in the Cheney area, such as fishing, boating, biking, hiking, and camping. Just south of Cheney is the Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge, a unique area of wetlands, grasslands, and forests, where you can see a variety of birds, waterfowl, and other forest dwellers in their natural habitat.  
  
We are proud of our city, and are confident that we truly have something to offer everyone.  
  

Mayor-Council Government
------------------------

Cheney has an elected mayor (elected at-large), who serves as the city's chief executive officer, and a city council (elected at-large), which is responsible for formulating and adopting city policies.  
  
The mayor-council form of government is characterized by a separation of executive and legislative powers and a system of checks and balances patterned after our traditional national and state governments.  
  
The mayor and council members serve on a part-time basis, leaving most of the day-to-day operations to full-time administrative personnel.
