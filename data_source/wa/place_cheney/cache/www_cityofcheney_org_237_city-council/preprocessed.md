City Council
============

The City of Cheney has a "strong mayor" form of local government. This means that the Mayor is elected by the community at large every four years and serves as the City's chief executive officer.

The City Council is the legislative body and consists of seven City Councilmembers, who are elected by the community at large to serve four-year terms. The City Council is responsible for formulating and adopting City policies.

The Mayor-Council form of government is characterized by a separation of executive and legislative powers and a system of checks and balances patterned after our traditional national and state governments.
The Mayor and City Councilmembers serve on a part-time basis, leaving most of the day-to-day operations to full-time administrative personnel.
