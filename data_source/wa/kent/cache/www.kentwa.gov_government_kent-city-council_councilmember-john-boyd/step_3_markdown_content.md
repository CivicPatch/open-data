![Councilmember John Boyd](https://www.kentwa.gov/home/showpublishedimage/24260/638446489711770000)Councilmember John Boyd grew up in Southern California, where he began his career in the U.S. Navy. There, he gained experience by interacting with a diverse group of people from across the country.

John’s first visit to Washington State was in 1978 while he was in the Navy. At the time, he was on Temporary Assigned Duty at the Naval Air Station on Whidbey Island. John says that he loved it so much when he was here that when Boeing came to California in 1996, looking for skilled workers, he did not hesitate to accept their offer. Boyd then moved to Washington with his wife Cheryl and their two sons. He successfully secured a career at Boeing to provide for his family and recently retired.

John takes pride in his work and life story, enabling him to become the person he is today. He is a leader, a provider, a father, and a husband. However, above all, he is someone who cares about his community.

John has lived in Kent for nearly 28 years, during which time he came to know it as home.

Through working and volunteering with organizations like SeaMar and Therapeutic Health Services he has made a difference in his community by helping those dealing with substance abuse issues; and with a degree in Human Services and as a certified Substance Abuse counselor, he feels ready to address our ongoing situations.

John understands that a community is only healthy when its members step up to take care of it, and he uses his time to put his beliefs into practice.

Boyd states that while he sits on the Kent City Council, he is glad to be a part of the decision-makers that shape Kent to address challenges and continued growth so families can comfortably work, live, and play.

John also states that since retiring, his new hobbies have been going to the gym, playing chess, cooking, and spending time with family.

His top priority is coming up with and executing a plan that will decrease homelessness and drug and alcohol dependency in the community. His priorities are improving public safety, attracting new businesses, and helping individuals gain employment.

John says he will ensure that there is fiscal responsibility and that your tax dollars are being accounted for.

John is pro-union, pro-family, pro-gun safety, and pro-choice. As a council member, he aims to keep the City of Kent and its people safe.
