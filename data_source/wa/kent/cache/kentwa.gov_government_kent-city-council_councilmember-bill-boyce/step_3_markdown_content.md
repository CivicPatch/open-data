  [Feedback]()  [Print]()   ![Councilmember Bill Boyce](images/c6e11bbe68275f487ff2a21cfd3bf913d29819e4ac706bdd3d6cbe61b513d79f.jpg) 

Born and raised in North Carolina, Kent City Councilmember Bill Boyce first came to Washington when he was stationed at Fort Lewis as an US Army airborne ranger paratrooper for four years. Bill loved the area so much, he decided to stay. He moved to Kent in 1984, where he and his wife Debbie raised five children. With a bachelor’s degree in business, Bill has been at the Boeing Company for 36 years, currently as a Senior Manufacturer leader. 

Bill has always been passionate about being involved in the community where he lives. Before being elected to Kent City Council, currently in his third term, he served on the Kent School District Board of Directors for 16 years, including four terms as board president. He is a charter member and past president of the Kent Sunrise Rotary Club, and he served as a commissioner of the Criminal Justice Training Center for 13 years. 

Bill currently represents Kent on the Sound Cities Association Public Interest Committee as a member. He also serves on the Harborview Medical Center Board of Trustees.

Bill believes one of the most important roles he plays is ensuring government transparency and accountability. “Making sure the people of Kent have access to their government is crucial,” said Bill. “We need to ensure we get our residents the best bang for their buck, keep taxes low and deliver high quality services that their families can count on.”

Bill is a firm believer that we need to provide a safe and welcoming community that will attract new residents, well-paying jobs and potential development to our city.

“It is so important that we make Kent a place that everyone can call home. Businesses should be proud of not only locating here but the top-quality workforce we provide as well. We must continue to create a wide variety of jobs for the diverse residents who call Kent home,” Bill concluded.

When not at work or doing community service, Bill loves to spend quality family time. He enjoys BBQing and smoking high quality meats for his wife Debbie, his kids and his grandkids. He enjoys watching and participating in sporting events, spending time outdoors and checking out new businesses in Kent. Bill lives on the East Hill with his wife Debbie, and his 5 kids – all KSD graduates – still reside around the region with his grandchildren.

“Having a close-knit family is one of the most important things to me,” says Bill. “We get together every Sunday for a big family dinner. We like going up to the mountains or playing outdoor games, sitting, laughing and having a good time.”
