            "notes": "Lynnwood, Washington operates under a mayor-council government. George Hurst was elected Mayor in the November 2025 general election. The Lynnwood City Council consists of seven members elected at-large. In the November 2025 election, Robert Leutwyler and Derica Escamilla retained their council seats, and Bryce Owings won a council seat. Josh Binda, a previous council member, is no longer in office. The election for one council position (Position #2) was too close to call between Isabel Mata and Ki Sueng Cho as of November 5, 2025, meaning an elected official for this role is not yet confirmed. Another council position (Position #6) is likely vacant as George Hurst, the previous occupant of that position, was elected Mayor. Nick Coelho and David Parshall are listed as current council members on the city's website, and no information from the 2025 election indicates a change in their status. Lynnwood City Council members are elected at-large, so there are no specific ward or district divisions."
