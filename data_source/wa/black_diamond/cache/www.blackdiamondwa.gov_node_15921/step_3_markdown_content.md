[Contact Debbie Page](https://www.blackdiamondwa.gov/user/766/contact)

Councilmember Page grew up in North Central Washington and earned her Bachelor of Arts Degree at Washington State University and the Edward R Murrow School of Communications.

Upon graduation she moved to the greater Seattle area where she has lived, worked and served the causes and organizations she cares deeply about since 1992.

In addition to her city council appointment in April of 2021, Debbie is an internationally recognized and award winning entrepreneur, business coach and advocate for women’s economic independence and is recognized as the leading authority on cash flow and profitability for women in business.

*“My vision for Black Diamond and the community is for it to be the gold standard for responsible and sustainable urban growth while preserving and protecting green spaces, parks and mixed use spaces. To maintain respectful and transparent communication to and with all stakeholders. To be a sought after community to establish and grow successful small businesses and create thriving commerce. To be an inclusive welcoming city that respects diversity. To have thriving retail spaces to be used by our growing community and to be known as a destination for day use outdoor enthusiasts who come to Black Diamond for all the outdoor experiences and stay to enjoy our thriving business community.”*

When not coaching her clients from Sweden to Singapore and across North America, Debbie is a philanthropist, an optimist, a feminist and a decent Cribbage player. She loves a good glass of wine, hours in her garden, great conversation and studying the latest findings and applications in the fields of cognitive psychology and business strategy.

Debbie is the proud pet parent to Mr. Harley Hounderton, her 14 year old Labrador Retriever and doggy love of her life.

- [Budget, Finance, and Administration Committee](https://www.blackdiamondwa.gov/budget-finance-administration-committee)
