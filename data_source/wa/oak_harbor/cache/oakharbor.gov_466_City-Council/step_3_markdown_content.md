# City Council

![cohbm-11B -cropped](https://oakharbor.gov/ImageRepository/Document?documentID=2924 "cohbm-11B -cropped")

## Regular Meetings

The Oak Harbor City Council welcomes your attendance and participation at its meetings. The Council meets on the first and third Tuesday of each month at 5:30pm in the City Council Chambers. You may speak to the Council during the Public Comment portion at the beginning of each meeting and during any Public Hearings.

## Workshops

The Council Workshops take place monthly regarding subjects on which future action may be taken at a regular Council meeting. These Workshops allow Councilmembers to get their questions answered so that when the item comes to Council, members will have the information required to make an appropriate decision. Workshops typically occur on the fourth Tuesday of each month at 1:00pm in the City Council Chambers. Workshops are open to the public; however, there is no public comment period. 

## Executive Session

The Council occasionally meets in Executive Session, which is not open to the public by law. The Council can only discuss certain items of business during Executive Sessions. These topics include personnel matters, property acquisition and disposition, and legal advice on litigation matters.
