## Biography

Eric Marshall was appointed by the City Council and sworn in as Councilmember for Position 3 on February 23.

Councilmember Marshall's family moved to Oak Harbor from San Diego in 1980 when his father was stationed to NAS Whidbey Island. He attended school in Oak Harbor and graduated from Oak Harbor High School in 1992.

At a young age his parents instilled in him the importance of volunteerism and giving back to your community. As a student he volunteered his time with school groups such as Students Against Drunk Driving (SADD) and the National Honor Society. He also volunteered with community events like the Haunted House and Kids' Fishing Derby. As an adult, Eric has been serving as a volunteer board member for the Oak Harbor Football and Cheer League for the past 15 years, the last 10 as president. He is also a North Cascade Youth Football League Vice President and an advisory member of the Washington State Football Coalition. Eric is a past Commissioner on the Oak Harbor Planning Commission, a Coupeville Chamber of Commerce Director, an Oak Harbor Chamber of Commerce Director, the Oak Harbor Main Street president, a United Way of Island County board member and a Whidbey Playhouse board member.

The father of two grown children, Eric and his wife, Michele, were married at Admiralty Head Lighthouse in 1998. Together they own and operate Whidbey Weekly and Printing and feel blessed to call Oak Harbor their home.
