5/15/25 City Council Recap Mayor Reuter initiated and concluded public hearings, on the six-year Transportation Improvement Plan (2026-2031) and the Water System Plan Update. There was no public testimony. Council reviewed Nuisance Abatement code recommendations from Planning Commission as well as proposed language from two of the council members. Council chose to work through the 12 pages of suggested code updates section by section. Mayor Reuter facilitated the discussion, and Council gave the Planner direction based on simple majority consensus for each section. The planner will bring back revisions based on Council‚Äôs directions for final adoption at a later meeting. Council awarded the North 1st Street Chip Seal project to Sierra Santa Fe Corporation, contingent upon the state Transportation Improvement Board‚Äôs final approval. Council authorized two interlocal agreements with Cowlitz County to move city water mains as part of their South Cloverdale and Cloverdale Confer Rd projects. One to allow the County‚Äôs contractor to work on city infrastructure the other to allocate the cost share and grant funding for the project. Council authorized the City Administrator to sign an interlocal agreement for services with the Cowlitz Wahkiakum Council of Governments to facilitate Kalama‚Äôs Internal Transit Feasibility Study. Federal funds were awarded last year to pay for the majority of this project. City Council approved an ordinance amending the city‚Äôs budget, a resolution declaring some police firearms surplus, as well as a resolution adopting the 6 Year Transportation Plan.

üì¢ Public Service Announcement: Understanding Nuisance Abatement Ordinances Hello Kalama! We‚Äôd like to take a moment to clear up a common misconception in our community: What exactly is a Nuisance Abatement Ordinance? Let‚Äôs break it down: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ ‚ùì What Is a Nuisance Abatement Ordinance? A Nuisance Abatement Ordinance is a local city law (ordinance) designed to protect public health, safety, and quality of life. These ordinances help cities respond to properties or activities that create ongoing problems for a neighborhood, such as: ‚Ä¢ Unsafe buildings or structures ‚Ä¢ Chronic loud noise ‚Ä¢ Illegal dumping or accumulation of trash ‚Ä¢ Overgrown yards that harbor pests ‚Ä¢ Persistent criminal activity on or around a property These laws are enforced by the city, and they exist to make sure everyone can live in a clean, safe, and peaceful environment. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ üöì What Happens if a Property Violates a Nuisance Ordinance? If a property repeatedly violates a nuisance ordinance, the city may: ‚Ä¢ Issue warnings or citations ‚Ä¢ Require property owners to fix the issue ‚Ä¢ In serious or ongoing cases, take legal action to abate the problem The goal isn‚Äôt to punish‚Äîit‚Äôs to resolve chronic issues that affect the whole community. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ ü§ù Why It Matters When nuisance issues go unaddressed, they can lead to: ‚Ä¢ Declining property values ‚Ä¢ Unsafe conditions ‚Ä¢ Increased crime ‚Ä¢ Lower quality of life Nuisance abatement ordinances help keep our neighborhoods safe, clean, and enjoyable for everyone. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ ‚ùîWhat's next? If you have concerns about a nuisance property in your area, or want to learn more about the current discussion regarding the updating of Kalama‚Äôs ordinance, read the proposed draft ordinance here: [https://5il.co/3dtcd](https://5il.co/3dtcd) Direct specific concerns or inquiries regarding the ordinance to [cityclerk@cityofkalama.com](mailto:cityclerk@cityofkalama.com).
