The measure sought to increase the City of Brier's regular property tax levy to maintain public safety and other essential city services. Final certification from Snohomish County Elections is expected this week.     "We respect the will of the voters although we were hoping for a different outcome," said Mayor Dale Kaemingk. "The budget pressures that led to this proposal remain unresolved. City leadership will now consider how to address these challenges moving forward, including possibility of a revised ballot measure in the future."     Without additional funding, the City will evaluate potential impacts to service levels across departments, including administration, police, public works and other core functions. The City currently faces an annual deficit of about $500,000, which has been forecasted to result in a negative balance in the General Fund by 2029. |     |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | | --- | --- | | |  | | --- | | **Related Information**      **Documents and Resources**    - [**Ballot Title and Explanatory Statement**](http://www.ci.brier.wa.us/cityhall/levy/explanatorystatement.pdf) - [**Agenda Bill**](http://www.ci.brier.wa.us/cityhall/levy/Agenda%20Bill.pdf) - [**City Council Resolution 608**](http://www.ci.brier.wa.us/cityhall/levy/City%20Council%20Resolution%20608.pdf) - [**Pro/Con Committee Announcement**](http://www.ci.brier.wa.us/cityhall/levy/Pro%20Con%20Committee%20Announcement.pdf) - [**View the April Presentation**](http://www.ci.brier.wa.us/cityhall/levy/prop1presentation.pdf) - [**View the March Mailer**](http://www.ci.brier.wa.us/cityhall/levy/marchmailer.pdf) - [**2024 Brier Police Dept.

If approved, the measure would increase the City's property tax rate from $0.57821 to $1.07821 per $1,000 of assessed value.     The City of Brier currently faces an annual deficit of about $500,000, which has been forecasted to result in a negative balance in the General Fund by 2029. Proposition 1 would generate the revenue needed to maintain the Brier Police Department, support public safety operations, and sustain other vital city services. This measure would support continued responsive, community-focused policing for Brier residents.     **Funding Brier's Independent Police Department**     The Brier Police Department is central to ensuring the public safety of our community. The City of Brier is proud to have a local, independent police department that is closely aligned with the needs of our residents.     **2024 Brier Police Department Statistics:**    * A 172% increase in proactive, officer-initiated activity. * Over 545% increased targeted traffic enforcement and crime deterrence efforts, focusing on areas identified by community concerns. * Achieved full staffing in 2024, eliminating the need for patrol assistance from the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office.  Public safety services, including the Brier Police Department, are primarily funded through the City's General Fund, which relies on property taxes. Public safety costs, including police services, make up approximately 51% of the City's General Fund. Proposition 1 would approve the funding needed to maintain effective, responsive public safety services for Brier residents.     Have questions?

What is Proposition 1?  Proposition 1 asks Brier voters to approve a one-time property tax increase of $0.50 per $1,000 of assessed value, starting in 2026. If approved, the measure would fund public safety services, including the City's independent police department and other essential governmental services, by increasing the City's tax rate from $0.57821 to $1.07821 per $1,000 in assessed value. The levy lid lift would generate about $1.1 million annually to address a funding gap caused by inflation and limited revenue growth, ensuring the City can maintain public safety and other vital services for our community.    2. Why is the City of Brier proposing Proposition 1?  Proposition 1 addresses a funding gap between the City's revenue and the rising costs of public safety and essential services. The City's primary funding source, property taxes, can only increase by 1% annually under state law, which hasn't kept pace with inflation and increasing public safety expenses. The City currently faces an annual deficit of about $500,000, which could lead to a negative balance in the General Fund by 2029. Proposition 1 would generate the revenue needed to maintain the Brier Police Department, support public safety operations, and sustain other vital city services.    3. What is a levy lid lift?  A levy lid lift is a voter-approved measure that allows the city to increase its existing property tax rate beyond the state-mandated 1% annual limit. It is not a new tax. It allows local governments to address rising costs and maintain essential services by adjusting the "lid" or cap on property tax revenue growth.    4. What City services would Proposition 1 fund?  Proposition 1 is a public safety levy designed to fund essential services that protect and benefit the Brier community. The primary focus is to maintain the independent Brier Police Department, which currently accounts for 45% of the City's General Fund. This includes funding for officers, salaries, overtime costs, and collaboration with the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office. Funds would also cover additional public safety needs such as emergency dispatch (Sno911), prosecutor and public defender services, fire marshal services, and emergency management. Altogether, public safety expenses make up about 51% of the City's General Fund.   Beyond public safety, levy revenues would help sustain other vital city services and staffing needs.    5. How is the Brier Police Department currently funded, and why is additional funding needed?  The Brier Police Department is funded through the City's General Fund, which relies on property taxes as its primary revenue source. Public safety costs, including the Police Department, account for approximately 51% of the General Fund budget, with the Police Department alone making up 45%. State law limits property tax revenue growth to just 1% annually, which hasn't kept up with inflation or the rising costs of supporting our independent police force. Without additional funding, the City faces an annual deficit of about $500,000 and a negative balance of the General Fund by 2029.    6. How would Proposition 1 impact my taxes?  If approved, Proposition 1 would increase the City's property tax rate by $0.50 per $1,000 of assessed value, starting in 2026. For the average homeowner in Brier, this would add approximately $37 per month to their property tax bill.    7. What happens if Proposition 1 is not approved?  If Proposition 1 is not approved, the City would face an ongoing annual deficit of approximately $500,000. Without the additional funding from Proposition 1, the City would need to evaluate potential service reductions to balance the budget, which could impact public safety and other critical operations that residents rely on.    8. Is a levy lid lift a new tax?  No, a levy lid lift is not a new tax. It adjusts the City's existing property tax rate to provide additional funding for public safety and other essential services. For Proposition 1, the proposed levy lid lift would increase the City's current property tax rate by $0.50 per $1,000 of assessed value, starting in 2026. The proposed total levy rate will remain well below the limit set by state law of $1.875 per $1,000 assessed property value.    9. If approved, when would Proposition 1 take effect?  If Proposition 1 is approved by voters on the April 22, 2025 ballot, the levy lid lift would take effect on January 1, 2026.    10. Are there property tax discounts for seniors or disabled property owners?  Yes. Seniors and disabled property owners who qualify for property tax discounts under state law (RCW 84.36.381 through RCW 84.36.389) would continue to receive those discounts if Proposition 1 is approved.   If you believe you may qualify, contact the Snohomish County Assessor's Office for more information on eligibility and how to apply.    11. How are my property taxes calculated?  Your property taxes are based on the assessed value of your property, as determined by the Snohomish County Assessor's Office, and the tax rates set by various taxing districts, including the City of Brier.   Proposition 1 would increase the City's portion of your property tax rate by $0.50 per $1,000 of assessed value. For example, this would add approximately $37 per month to the property tax bill for a home assessed at Brier's average value of $865,300.    12. Who is eligible to vote?  Registered voters within the city limits of Brier are eligible to vote. To pass, a simple majority vote (50% plus 1) of qualified Brier voters in the April 22, 2025, special election is needed. There is no minimum voter turnout requirement.    13. Where can I learn more?
