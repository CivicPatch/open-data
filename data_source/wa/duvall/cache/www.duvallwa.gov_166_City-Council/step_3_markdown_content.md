# City Council

## City Council Responsibilities

Holding an elected office requires a solid commitment to the community. City and state codes legally define a Councilmember's role. This outline is meant to describe a Councilmember's role in Duvall. 

The Duvall City Council is an elected body of seven members. Its primary responsibility is to set policies for the City, which is vital to the budget process. The Mayor is responsible for ensuring that policies established by the Council are implemented. Each Councilmember oversees policy issues in some aspect of City government. In addition to staying informed about local policy issues, Councilmembers must also be aware of state and county-level issues that may impact the City.
