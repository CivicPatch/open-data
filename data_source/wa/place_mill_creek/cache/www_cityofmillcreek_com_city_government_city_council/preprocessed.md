The Mill Creek City Council establishes policies through the adoption of ordinances, resolutions, and directives to achieve the City's vision and mission. Through its legislative actions, the Council establishes priorities for the City Manager and staff. The Council consists of seven members elected at-large to four year terms. Every two years, the City Council elects from its members the Mayor, who serves as chairperson, and the Mayor Pro Tem, who assumes mayoral responsibilities in the Mayor's absence. The Council also appoints a City Manager to carry out the policies and priorities that the Council adopts. The City Manager is the Chief Executive Officer of the City.
