 __ * The City of Wenatchee's Vision Statement:*__ 

  *"To create community through responsive leadership and services for the citizens and visitors of the*  *Apple Capital of the World."*  

 The Wenatchee City Council consists of seven members (representing five districts and two-at large positions) who have been elected by the residents of Wenatchee to serve staggered terms.  To find the representative for a district please refer to the district map.  The district map is located in the city's [GIS maps](https://maps.wenatcheewa.gov/portal/apps/experiencebuilder/experience/?id=6a4b4f9f7461498f9d530511b3c6f198).  In general, the Council develops and adopts City policies that govern operations proposed by the Mayor. The Council establishes and outlines goals and priorities, including budgetary framework and personnel policies. The Council does not make personnel decisions or manage the work of City employees. The Council approves all City contracts and expenditures and provides guidance to the Mayor or other City representatives. 

Regular meetings of the Wenatchee City Council are held the 2nd and 4th Thursdays of each month at 5:15 PM.  Work sessions (as needed) are held the 3rd Thursday of the month at 5:15 PM.  Meetings are held at the Wenatchee City Hall Council Chambers, 301 Yakima Street, Wenatchee, WA. Wenatchee City Council meetings are also broadcast live on the city's [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/WenatcheeTV).

 The meetings are open to the public and the City Council encourages public participation. If you are not able to attend the meeting in person, arrangements can be made to participate remotely. Please contact the City Clerk at (509) 888-6204 to arrange remote participation.

  __Sharing Information and Concerns with the Council__ 

The Wenatchee City Council invites citizens to share information or concerns at a Council meeting. You may also contact Council members personally or directly (see "Meet the Council Members" webpage for contact information). 

 Certain issues, however, should be directed to City staff instead of the Council, outside of City Council meetings. These issues include:  

 *   __Complaints about staff members__  - Responsibility for dealing with staff issues should be directed to a specific department manager first, then to the Executive Services Director.  
 *   __Requests for information or services __ - If you don’t know which department to call, contact the Mayor’s Office at (509) 888-6204.  
 *   __Complaints about services__  - If you don’t know which department to call, contact the Mayor’s Office  at (509) 888-6204.  
 *   __Letters__  - Letters may be sent to Council members by hand-delivering or mailing them to City Hall, Mayor’s Office, PO Box 519, Wenatchee, WA 98807. Rarely is any action taken until after the issue has  been researched and reviewed by both Council and staff.  
 *   __Policy issues__  - Policy or legislative issues may be brought before the Council at a regular Council meeting. If a law or policy change is needed, it will be placed on a future agenda for full discussion and consideration. 

  __Quasi-Judicial Proceedings__  

 A quasi-judicial proceeding is an action in which a public hearing is required by state statute or local ordinance. During this process, the decision maker will consider evidence for or against the proposal, and the decision will impact specific parties. Examples of quasi-judicial proceedings include applications for subdivisions, variances, conditional use permits, and small rezones.

If a quasi-judicial proceeding is required, certain "procedural due process" elements must be satisfied. For land use hearings, procedural due process includes appearance of fairness for decision makers, proper notice of the hearing, a proper hearing process, a complete record, and a decision based on the record. Ex parte contact with the decision maker, e.g. City Council members, affects the appearance of fairness of procedural due process. RCW 42.36 is the appearance of fairness statute that establishes guidelines for fairness at land use hearings.
