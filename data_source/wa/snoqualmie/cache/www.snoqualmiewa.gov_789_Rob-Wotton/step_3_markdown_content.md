# Councilmember Rob Wotton, Position 2

![Councilmember Wotton Headshot for website](https://www.snoqualmiewa.gov/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=37574)[Councilmember Wotton](mailto:rwotton@snoqualmiewa.gov)  
Position 2  
Term Expires: 12/31/2027

My wife Julie and I became Snoqualmie residents in 2005 after arriving in the Snoqualmie Valley six years prior. Like so many others, we felt this was the best place to raise our family.

As a local bank manager, I have the privilege of working with businesses, nonprofits and families throughout our community, which provides me a perspective of the challenges we face and finding opportunities to make a difference for others.

Growing up in Shelton, a rural town on the Olympic Peninsula, I spent my free time in Scouting, eventually became an Eagle Scout. I graduated as a Dean’s Scholar from the University of Puget Sound in Business Administration and Political Science. While running my business and teaching at Olympic College, I returned to complete my masters degree in Business Administration at Pacific Lutheran University, specializing in Technology and Innovation Management.

My experience includes being elected to the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business; co-chairing the Community Development Committee for the Western States; serving as a community advisor to U.S. Senator Slade Gorton; and serving as a senior intern to Washington’s Secretary of State Ralph Munro.

Locally, I have served as the treasurer of Encompass NW and The Trail Youth; district chairman for the Boy Scouts of America; on the boards of the SnoValley Chamber of Commerce and the Seattle Lighthouse for the Blind Foundation; and am the founding president of the SnoValley Innovation Center.

After serving on the City’s Economic Development Commission for six years prior to my appointment to the City Council, I continue to advocate for affordable housing, transportation improvements, and local jobs. Additionally, serving on the Public Safety Committee is a fitting way to honor my Dad who was a volunteer firefighter and the fire, police and medics who serve to protect all of us.
