# City Government

##### North Bonneville operates under the Strong Mayor form of Mayor-Council government. The Mayor is responsible to the residents for implementing city council’s policies and for the overall management and administration of the city. The mayor supervises all city staff.

 

##### City Council

##### The North Bonneville city council consists of five members and is responsible to the residents of North Bonneville for broad policy direction, city legislation, and governance of the community. The councilors are elected at large, which means that each councilor represents all residents rather than those in a particular area of the city. Councilors represent the community on various boards and committees, and receive a $25 per meeting stipend with no other benefits. **The North Bonneville City Council meets twice monthly; on the second and fourth Tuesday of each month.**
