 __E-mail__ : [sean.kelly@maplevalleywa.gov](mailto:sean.kelly@maplevalleywa.gov) 

Sean P. Kelly was first elected to Maple Valley Council in 2011. In January of 2015, the Maple Valley City Council selected Kelly as Mayor. Mayor Kelly and the rest of the Maple Valley City Council establish policy direction and provide direction to the leadership of the City through the City Manager.  Mayor Kelly strongly supports maintaining relationships with local, county and state leaders. He continues to serve and enrich the City through supporting economic development efforts and relationship building amongst local leadership groups such as the Chamber of Commerce, Rotary, and the Maple Valley Fire and Life Safety - to name a few. Regionally, he has been an active participant in conversations, workgroups and policy regarding public safety, transportation, homelessness and chemical dependency.

Throughout his career in public service, Kelly has gained extensive experience in developing meaningful local, regional, and statewide partnerships. Kelly has served as a member of the Maple Valley audit committee, public safety oversight committee, and chaired the King County Emergency Management Advisory Committee. He was also the safety coordinator for the Tahoma School District for 10 years.

A graduate of the Tahoma School District, Kelly also attended Green River College from 1993 to 1995 before securing work at The Boeing Company's Everett Plant in the safety department. In 2005, Kelly was hired by Tahoma School District as a safety officer. He now serves as the Supervisor of Operations (Transportation, Maintenance, Custodial services, Safety and Security).

A testament to his commitment to citywide service and engagement, he has been an active member of the greater Maple Valley community for nearly two decades, also serving as the president of the Maple Valley Days Organization for five years.

Kelly resides in Maple Valley, Washington and is an avid outdoor recreationalist. He enjoys crabbing in the Puget Sound with his son, Carson, and visiting the family cabin on Camano Island with his wife, Jen.
