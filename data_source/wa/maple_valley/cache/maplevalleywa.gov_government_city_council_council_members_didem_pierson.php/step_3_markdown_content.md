# Didem Pierson

 

**Position 2**

**First Appointed:** March 2022

**Current Term Expires:**  December 2025

**E-mail**: [didem.pierson@maplevalleywa.gov](mailto:didem.pierson@maplevalleywa.gov)

I was appointed to the Council in 2022 and elected in 2023, and it’s been a honor to serve the place I’ve proudly called home for over 25 years.

I immigrated to the United States from Turkey and found a true sense of belonging in Maple Valley. This is where I’ve raised my three children and built lasting relationships through years of volunteering and local involvement.

My path in public service began with education. I served on the Tahoma School Board from 2003 to 2019, where I worked to support student success, advance educational equity, and foster strong partnerships between schools and families.

I care deeply about our community and believe in the power of service, collaboration, and listening. I’m accessible and always open to hearing from residents, because I believe effective leadership starts with understanding the needs and concerns of the people we serve.

I’m passionate about wellness, public safety, and the arts—and I especially value the open spaces and natural resources that make Maple Valley such a special place to live. I’m committed to protecting and preserving what makes our city unique while working to ensure it remains a welcoming, vibrant place for everyone.

Serving Maple Valley is a privilege I cherish. I welcome opportunities to connect and support residents—please don’t hesitate to reach out.
