|---|

 __First Elected__ : November 2015 

 __Current Term Expires__ : December 2027

 __E-mail__ : [leslie.burberry@maplevalleywa.gov](mailto:leslie.burberry@maplevalleywa.gov) 

My wife Patty and I met at Cincinnati Christian University.  We were married in 1986 and relocated to the Great Northwest in 1989.  Here we have raised our 6 children and have been privileged to have them matriculate through the Tahoma School District.  We were attracted to Maple Valley for many of the same reasons you were, a family friendly community, great schools, and the abundant opportunities to enjoy the outdoors. 

I have been employed for the past 8 years by AAA Washington as a Regional Sales Manager in Insurance Operations.   Previous to that I worked for 18 years for Liberty Mutual as an Agent and Office Operations Manager.  During my insurance career I have earned several professional designations and enjoy the challenge that management affords.

We have been members of New Community Church here in Maple Valley for 18 years and active in community service through the church.  Prior to being elected to the City Council, I served as Vice-Chairman of the Planning Commission for 2 years.  I am a volunteer for Junior Achievement.

It is a time of exciting change that will transform our community.  The new Tahoma High School will be a symbol that “Kids Matter”.  We have the opportunity to build a gathering place and a focal point for the community at large on the Legacy Site.  It is also a time of critical challenges.  How will we cope with the congestion that development in Black Diamond will bring?  What changes to our budget will be necessary to bring it into balance?  How will we diversify our community to attract jobs and economic development? 

I value the trust you have placed in me to be your city councilmember.  And I have a passion to find the answers to our challenges to make Maple Valley even better.  Therefore I will be working diligently over the next 4 years to accomplish the tasks you endorsed in the campaign; accelerate transportation improvements, adopt fiscally responsible budgets,  and attract small to medium sized employers to the city.
