|---|

 __First Appointed__ : May 2018

 __Current Term Expires__ : December 2027

 __E-mai__ l: [syd.dawson@maplevalleywa.gov ](mailto:syd.dawson@maplevalleywa.gov) 

My family and I moved to Maple Valley in 1999, attracted to the natural beauty of the city and surrounding area. Since then my wife, Julie, and I were able to raise our two children in our great community. After living in several locations and regions across the United States, I have now lived in Maple Valley longer than any place previously.

Maple Valley has experienced many achievements over the past 20 years. Since the City’s inception, Maple Valley has become a highly sought-after community to live and raise families. It has retained the close-knit feeling of a small town while continuing to grow. Neighbors see each other wherever they go in town. It is this close-knit atmosphere that makes people want to live here.

I have been fortunate to be able to participate in many different aspects of our community. I have served on The Highlands at Lake Wilderness HOA, President and board member for the Greater Maple Valley Community Center, board member of the Maple Valley Historical Society, adult volunteer for Boy Scout Troop 711 and a Little League coach.

In April 2018, I was honored to be appointed to the Maple Valley City Council. This is an exciting time to be able to serve on the Council. We are at a point in time where we can respect our past while developing the future look and feel of our great community. We will need the input of our residents, business owners and community organizations. It will also require the collaboration at regional and state levels to achieve this.

Your thoughts, ideas and comments are important. Please contact me or any of my fellow council members at any time.
