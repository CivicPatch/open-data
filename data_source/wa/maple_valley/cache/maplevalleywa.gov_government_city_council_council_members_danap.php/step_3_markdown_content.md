# Deputy Mayor Dana Parnello

 

**Position 6**

**First Elected**: November 2015

**Current Term Expires:** December 2025

**E-mail**: [dana.parnello@maplevalleywa.gov](mailto:dana.parnello@maplevalleywa.gov)

By way of background, I earned a BS in Environmental Policy Analysis and Planning from the University of California, and a Masters in Recreation Administration from the University of Northern Colorado. While doing so, I enjoyed the enviable benefit of residing in Davis, CA and Fort Collins, CO. Both of those communities have long been recognized as among the “Best Places to Live” in America. Seeing strong, foundational similarities to those communities, my wife and school age daughters and I began calling Maple Valley home in 2003.

I care about our quality of life and I believe that you care, too. I am certain that many of us want to be involved, but few of us know how we can best use our skills and experiences to keep Maple Valley a community worthy of our numerous accolades as a great place to raise a family. I began my local involvement in a variety of small and important ways. I started co-leading Girl Scout Troop 52864, volunteering at Rock Creek Elementary School, with Washington Trails Association at Taylor and Tiger Mountain State parks, and Maple Valley Make a Difference Days. As I got to know a little more about the opportunities, I put my education to work as I served on Maple Valley’s Planning Commission and as Liaison to Library Advisory Board.  I left the position of Planning Commission Chair only because I was honored to have been able to help out by filling a council seat from 2010-2011.

I will continue working hard to help Maple Valley earn a reputation as a livable, walkable, bicycle friendly community, with a variety of gathering places. I firmly believe these aspects are strongly tied to public safety as well as physical well-being and economic health. Handled well, and working together, we can create an identity that represents and resonates with each of us.

I am eager to hear from you and work with you to shape our community.
