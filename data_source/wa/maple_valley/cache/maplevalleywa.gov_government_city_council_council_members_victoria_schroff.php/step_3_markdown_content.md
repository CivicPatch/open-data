My family and I moved to Maple Valley in 2009 shortly after visiting friends here and falling head over heels for this beautiful place! My husband and I feel beyond fortunate to have raised our daughter, now a UW grad, in the Tahoma School District and this community has exceeded our expectations in every way.

I have been a licensed massage therapist for most of my adult life and have been self-employed in Maple Valley for a number of years where I also have been active in the community, volunteering for a number of local organizations. My flexible schedule allows me to be truly present for our city and serving on the Maple Valley Planning Commission helped provide me with an excellent foundation and education on the inner workings of our local government and the processes and intricacies of coming together as a group to accomplish goals that best benefit the city as a whole.

I pride myself on being a good listener and weighing all sides before rushing to judgement knowing that it is important to learn as much as you can about an issue before weighing in with a final vote.

I am so honored to serve Maple Valley on City Council and promise to always do my best for all of us!
