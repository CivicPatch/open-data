## Councilmember

Ryan Whitten grew up in Grandview and Prosser, WA. His family has a long history of farming in the Yakima Valley. He spent eight years in the Navy as an Avionics Technician working on F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet fighters.  He now works at Energy Northwest as an Instrument and Controls Technician and is a member of IBEW 77. Ryan completed an Associates Degree in Political Science at Columbia Basin College where he enjoyed having meaningful discussions with his professors and peers.

Ryan loves history, philosophy, and motorsports. He often frequents car shows and occasionally does autocross at the Tri-City Raceway. He also enjoys gardening, golf, enjoying local amenities, live music, spending time with family and friends, and hiking with his dog, Frankie. 

Richland has been Ryan's home for eight years, and is where he met his wife in 2017. He has watched this area change dramatically since his childhood and cares deeply about this community. His aim is to promote and protect the best interests of the residents of Richland, and to encourage positive and beneficial changes as Richland continues to grow and evolve. Ryan is very honored to have the opportunity to serve Richland in City Council Position Number 7.
