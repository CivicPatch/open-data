## Background

Council Member Sadalge is the first person of South Asian descent to serve on the Tacoma City Council. Born in India, he moved to America when he was six years old. Like many immigrants and District 4 residents, he grew up in a household whose first language was not English. In college, he chose to become a U.S. citizen. According to the U.S. Census, almost a quarter of District 4 residents speak a language other than English at home. As a Council Member, he leverages his lived experience to build and strengthen relationships with his multi-lingual and immigrant neighbors.

After moving to Tacoma in 2019, prior to joining the Tacoma City Council, Council Member Sadalge dedicated himself to his community as a steering committee member on the City’s award-winning McKinley Hill Neighborhood Plan and as the District 4 representative on the City’s Planning Commission.

Council Member Sadalge also brings over 20 years of experience in the private sector, primarily in data analytics, and has helped relaunch and operate a small business in Tacoma that employed up to 25 individuals. He and his wife are members of the Tacoma-Pierce County Chamber of Commerce, and his wife, Maya, owns and operates a home-based craft business in Tacoma.

Deeply committed to the well-being of youth and children, Council Member Sadalge prioritizes addressing the root causes of youth violence, with a specific focus on gun violence. He is eager to champion data-driven solutions that can prevent the tragic deaths seen too often across the nation, including Tacoma. Committed to families and education, he also seeks to address the childcare desert in District 4 and champion early education options that support young children and provide economic support to women and families. An ardent supporter of our seniors, he also invests in their wellbeing, ensuring they have access to the resources and support they need to thrive in our vibrant community. As a housing champion, he aims to collaboratively address our region’s affordable housing crisis, with a special focus on reducing displacement and increasing housing supply in Tacoma.

Council Member Sadalge lives with his wife, Maya, in the McKinley Hill Neighborhood. He has been an avid player of wall handball since he was a teen in New York City, and was delighted to be able to play regularly with some of the best players in the country right here in Tacoma.
