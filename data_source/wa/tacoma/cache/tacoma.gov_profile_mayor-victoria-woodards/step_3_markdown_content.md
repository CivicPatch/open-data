As a part of these efforts, Tacoma was names one of 16  [Good Jobs, Great Cities](https://www.nlc.org/initiative/good-jobs-great-cities)  leaders to expand green jobs in Tacoma and Pierce County. Additionally, building on the relationships she has built with Tacoma’s local Puyallup Tribe of Indians, she also launched NLC’s Local Indigenous Leaders Constituency group focuses on native issues across the country.

Locally, her leadership roles include positions on the Puget Sound Regional Council Executive Board, Tacoma-Pierce County Economic Development Board, Greater Seattle Partners, South Sound Housing Affordability Partners, Tideflats Subarea Planning Steering Committee, and the WorkForce Central Board.
