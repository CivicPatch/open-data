# Mayor

**DIANE KOHOUT - MAYOR**

The responsibility of the Electric City Mayor is to serve all citizens and business owners fairly and openly.  A commitment to applying these principles in the most professional and timely manner possible is key in guiding our community through continued growth and success.  Mayor Diane Kohout is available to take phone calls Monday through Friday from 8:00 - 6:00 PM. Please feel free to leave a voice mail and she will get back to you as soon as possible.   
**Cell Phone (509) 631-1501**       
**City Hall Phone (509) 633-1510**  
**mayor@electriccity.us**

Diane retired from working in the public sector for 28 years.  She traveled across the state, talking with state employees in their homes about work and legislative issues, then assisting them to voice their concerns to management and legislators.  She has talked and listened to many of the city's residents while campaigning for Mayor and plans to work with the Council and employees to reorganize the city's priorities, focusing on building infrastructure and giving a real voice to Electric City residents.
