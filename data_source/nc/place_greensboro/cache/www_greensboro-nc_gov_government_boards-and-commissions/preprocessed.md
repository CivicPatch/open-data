Serving on a board or commission offers a unique opportunity for meaningful involvement in civic life and a rare opportunity for public service. The responsibility is great, and so are the rewards.

Applications to serve on a board or commission are purged after two years. Consider reapplying at that time if you remain interested in serving.

* + These boards are structured under general laws or local acts of the state. They are self-governing and function independently of any outside control. They report to the City Council and adhere to policies of the City Council that directly affect board responsibilities.
  + These boards develop short- and long-range goals, and make recommendations to City Council. They administer City Council policies within their respective areas of responsibility. In their advisory capacity, the boards act as important sources of information on a variety of activities that affect Greensboro and its residents.



* + Boards and commissions perform a variety of functions and provide a wide range of service to the City Council. Some boards, such as autonomous and quasi-judicial boards, are independent and operate outside the direct control of the Council. Some, such as examining and administrative boards, handle licensing and other specific administrative functions. Others, such as legislative and policy-making boards, are strongly advisory in nature and provide the Council with an important source of resident information and opinion.

    Information related to boards and commissions members that is on file in the City Clerk's Office is a matter of public record. The City Clerk is responsible for the Greensboro City Council's official boards and commissions' records, including data related to appointments, reappointments, resignations, contact information for boards and commissions' members, and other information.

    A staff liaison is assigned to maintain and update his or her own department's board and commission information.
  + Applicants must reside inside the Greensboro city limits to be considered for service on a City board or commission, excluding boards and commissions with exceptions such as: Firefighters Relief Fund, Greensboro Housing Authority, Greensboro Public Library Board of Trustees, Guilford City/County Insurance Advisory Commission, Guilford County Historic Properties Commission, Piedmont Triad Airport Authority, Piedmont Triad Regional Water Authority, and the Greensboro/Guilford Tourism Development Authority.
    Some boards and commissions require members with specific interests or credentials, or members who belong to a specific organization or group.
    City officials are specifically prohibited from serving on some boards or commissions; on others, they are expected to serve. City employees are ineligible to serve.

    Review the
    Boards and Commissions Handbook
    for specific information for each board/commission. Questions? Contact the City Clerk.
  + Once you have submitted your completed interest form and resumé to the City Clerk's Office, the clerk will forward the documents to City Council to make appointments at its discretion.

    If you are appointed to a board or commission, the mayor will send you a letter notifying you of your appointment and ask you to contact the City Clerk's Office to confirm your residence and willingness to serve on the board or commission to which you were appointed.

    Some boards require an oath of office. The City Clerk will schedule a convenient time for you to come to City Hall for the oath.

    The department that oversees the board or commission to which you are appointed will contact you to arrange your orientation prior to your first meeting.
