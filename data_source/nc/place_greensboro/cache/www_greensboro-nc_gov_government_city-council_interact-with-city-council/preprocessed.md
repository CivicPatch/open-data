First elected to City Council in 2011 as an At-Large Councilmember; re-elected in 2013, 2015, 2019, and 2022.

I ran for office to be an advocate for small businesses, as I was a small business owner for 22 years (Mahi's Restaurant), to support our public safety, and to give a voice to ALL of our residents. Constituents feel comfortable reaching out to me and I am always appreciative of their support. I give credit to City staff who are always willing to help me assist residents who have concerns or are facing challenges.

My goals for City Council are increasing the availability of affordable housing, continuing to pursue economic development opportunities in order to bring good pay jobs to Greensboro, supporting public safety and infrastructure, which includes transportation.

* Chair of the Metropolitan Planning Organization TAC
* Chair of the Piedmont Authority for Regional Transportation (PART)
* Human Relations Commission, 2008-2011 (prior to being elected)
* International Advisory Committee, 2007-2011 (prior to being elected)

Some of my favorite things about Greensboro are that I can be a cheerleader for such a wonderful city. I believe Greensboro is the best place in North Carolina to live, work, and play. We have wonderful opportunities with all of our recent job and economic development developments, and we have amazing recreational opportunities with our parks and trails systems.

I have been married to my husband Isa for 46 years and have two adult children, Joey and Michael, and have a rescued German Shepherd, Bella.  I am also a proud graduate of Greensboro College.

First elected to City Council in 2017; re-elected in 2022

I moved to Greensboro in 1975 and instantly fell in love with the community and decided to build my life here. My son and his family also live in Greensboro and I hope that my grandchildren will choose to live here with their families. While I saw Greensboro go through many changes over the years, I was concerned that we were stagnating as a city and would not keep up the quality of life that caused me to stay here. I also felt that the City Council representative for my district did not share my priorities. I could choose to complain about it, or I could choose to get involved. My religion teaches that we bear responsibility for not only our own moral, spiritual and material welfare, but for the welfare of society at large. With that as my background, I decided to step-up, run for office, and work to build a thriving community full of opportunities for all.

My primary goals for City Council include a focus on providing safe and affordable housing opportunities, reducing crime, and attracting great companies that provide quality employment opportunities within our community. Additionally, I want to focus on ensuring we maintain and improve the assets our community offers.

* Jordan Lake One Water Coalition

Some of my favorite things about Greensboro are our sense of community, our parks, the lack of traffic, and that we have four distinct seasons with good weather.

I currently work as a Project Manager for Offit Kurman, Attorneys. Previously in my career, I held positions as Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Operations for small and large family-owned businesses.
