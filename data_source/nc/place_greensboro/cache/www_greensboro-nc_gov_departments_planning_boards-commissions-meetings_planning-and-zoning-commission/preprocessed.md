The Greensboro Planning and Zoning Commission hears and decides requests for amendments to the City's official Zoning Map. The duties of the commission include hearing requests to rezone properties, including conditional zoning districts, reviewing original zoning requests (associated with annexations), and reviewing and recommending boundaries for new or altered zoning overlay districts. The commission also studies the needs and resources of Greensboro and plans for its appropriate development.

Some responsibilities include:

* Reviewing the text of the
  Land Development Ordinance
  and advising City Council on its changes.
* Advising City Council on measures related to annexations and comprehensive planning.
* Advising City Council on issues related to changes in the street network, such as street closings and street name changes.
* Making recommendations to City Council regarding community development activities (plans and financing options to preserve neighborhoods, enhance downtown, create jobs, and expand the supply of safe/affordable housing) and Neighborhood Small Projects program applications.

The Planning and Zoning Commission is composed of nine members appointed by City Council for three-year terms. Regular meetings are held on the third Monday of each month at 5:30 pm in Katie Dorsett Council Chamber of the Melvin Municipal Office Building.
