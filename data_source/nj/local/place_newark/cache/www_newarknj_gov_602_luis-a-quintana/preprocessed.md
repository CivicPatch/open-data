Council Member At-Large
-----------------------

Council Member Luis A. Quintana is a trailblazing public servant with over 35 years of service to the City of Newark. Elected to the Municipal Council in 1994, he became the first Hispanic elected Council Member-At-Large and later the first Hispanic of Puerto Rican descent to serve as Council President and Mayor of Newark.

Throughout his eight consecutive terms, Councilman Quintana has remained a steadfast advocate for the people of Newark, serving in numerous leadership roles including Council Vice President (2006–2010), Council President (2013), and Interim Mayor (2013–2014).

Born in Añasco, Puerto Rico, and raised in Newark from the age of seven, Councilman Quintana overcame early language barriers to become a dedicated student, graduating from Barringer High School and earning a B.A. in Criminal Justice from Seton Hall University. His lifelong commitment to youth and community began as a Youth Counselor and continued through leadership in civic, cultural, and educational organizations.

He is a former Deputy Mayor of Newark, a founding figure in numerous Latino and interfaith leadership coalitions, and an active member of the National League of Cities, Sister Cities International, and the Hispanic Elected Local Officials (HELO) Board, which he chaired from 2002–2003.

Councilman Quintana also founded The Newark Three Kings Celebration, Inc., a nonprofit organization that provides events and resources for children and seniors throughout the year. He currently serves as Vice Chairman of the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission, appointed by the Governor of New Jersey.

A recipient of dozens of civic and humanitarian awards, Councilman Quintana was inducted into the New Jersey Elected Officials Hall of Fame in 2015. His decades of leadership, advocacy, and dedication have left a lasting impact on Newark and beyond.
