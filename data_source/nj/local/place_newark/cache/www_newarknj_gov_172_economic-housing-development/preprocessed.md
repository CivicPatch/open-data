The mission of the Department of Economic and Housing Development is to create economic opportunity for Newark residents and enhance the vibrancy of our city. To this end, the department seeks to position Newark to take advantage of its unique assets, including its strategic location, a diverse and underutilized workforce, a large amount of developable land, a concentration of corporate and business service firms, several major universities, and a wealth of arts and cultural assets.
