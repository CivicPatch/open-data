Mayor's Message - January 2, 2026
---------------------------------

Dear Berkeley Township Residents,

As we welcome the New Year, I want to thank each of you for your continued involvement and commitment to our community. Berkeley Township remains a wonderful place to live because of the people who call it home, and I am grateful for the trust you place in your local government.  The start of the year is always a time for reflection, planning, and renewed commitment. I am proud of the direction our community continues to move forward.

Over the past year, we have made meaningful progress together. From improvements in our infrastructure to continued investments in our community events. Our shared efforts have strengthened Berkeley Township and reinforced the values that make it a great place to live, work, and raise a family. None of this would be possible without the dedication of Township staff, volunteers, local organizations, and engaged residents.

As many residents are aware, Berkeley Township is in the process of a township-wide property revaluation, which is mandated by the State. This process is required to happen every ten years or when the percentage of assessed value drops below 60 percent. The last evaluation occurred in 2010. The average percentage of assessed values is approximately 52 percent. Either of the above triggers a reevaluation. This process is to ensure that property assessments reflect current market conditions and that the local tax burden is distributed fairly and equitably.

Property owners have received notices outlining updated assessments. I encourage you to review this information carefully. If you have questions or believe your assessment does not accurately reflect your property, information regarding the appeal process is available through the Tax Assessor’s Office and on the Township website. Our staff is available to assist residents and help explain the process.

While a revaluation may result in changes to individual assessments, it does not automatically mean an increase in overall municipal revenue. Its primary purpose is fairness and accuracy.

Berkeley Township looks forward to an active start to 2026, with many opportunities for residents to connect and participate. We have our Recreation department that has programs and Senior Activities. Township Council Meetings continue to provide an open forum for public input and community discussion.

As we move through January and February, our focus remains on responsible planning and long-term growth. Berkeley Township departments are actively preparing for the year ahead, reviewing priorities, and ensuring that we continue to deliver efficient and transparent services. Winter months also give us the opportunity to assess upcoming projects and set goals that reflect the needs and voices of our community.

Our Berkely Township Library offers educational, cultural, and family-friendly events throughout the winter as well.

Please visit the Township website and social media pages for updated calendars, announcements, and registration details.

Thank you for your continued support, cooperation, and civic pride. Together, we will make 2026 a year of progress, opportunity, and positive change.

We wish you all a Happy and healthy New Year!

You are always welcome to contact my office, call 732-244-7400, ext. 1203, or [email me, the mayor](mailto:mayor@berkeleytownship.org).

Thank you,

Mayor John A. Bacchione
