------------

Joe Quintero was sworn in to the Hoboken City Council on January 1, 2022. A New Jersey native, Joe moved to Hoboken in 2006 to attend Fordham Law School in Manhattan. Joe has worked in banking/finance as a compliance officer since 2008 where he has focused on banking governance, ethics, and government interactions compliance.

Fluent in Spanish, Joe is the proud son of Colombian immigrants and the first in his family to graduate from college (University of Massachusetts-Amherst)and the first to obtain a graduate degree (JD from Fordham Law). Never one to shy away from hard work, prior to becoming a lawyer Joe has been a dish washer, pizza delivery person, janitor, electrician, salesperson, and software training, amongst other things.

Since 2019, Joe has held leadership positions with the Hoboken Democratic Committee where he has helped advocate for local issues and candidates and in 2020 led local efforts to support swing state Democratic organizations.

On the City Council Joe is looking forward to focusing on the needs of historically underrepresented groups in Hoboken.
