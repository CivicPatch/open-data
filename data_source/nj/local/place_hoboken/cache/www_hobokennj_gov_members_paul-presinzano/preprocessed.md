Paul Presinzano
---------------

Paul is a New Jersey native and has resided in Hoboken since 1996.

Upon moving to Hoboken, he has seen the community improve but also considers some remaining fixable issues. He ran to be your Hoboken City Council representative but came short in 2021. A good leader must be here for their constituents and puts the needs of others before their own.   Paul wants to ensure our quality of life is well looked after as the City embarks on a redevelopment phase, spending tax dollars more wisely, improving our road and sidewalk safety culture, and better maintaining our public assets.

Paul has been married to his wife, Ritu, since 2014, and together have a son Aiden. Taught from a very young age, Paul continually gives back to the communities and people that have made an impact in his life. After starting work at 13 in the restaurant business, he worked his way through college, receiving his B.A from Kutztown University and then built a 25-year career in finance. He was elected to the Kutztown University Alumni Foundation in 2014 and sits on the Executive Board in charge of the university’s endowment. He has been involved in sports all his life; he competed and umpired baseball, competed and coached track and field, and competed and actively coached rugby to date.

In all his experiences, Paul made decisions that impacted the moment and had the foresight of future considerations; that approach is what he wants to bring to the City Council. Giving back to Hoboken, the place and community he and his family call home, has been Paul’s priority. He is committed to being an independent voice on issues most important to you and bringing a future of continuous improvement of the quality of life for all Hoboken residents.
