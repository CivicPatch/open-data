Caitlin Layson
--------------

Caitlin Layson Namin is a lifelong Hoboken resident who grew up in the city’s 4th Ward.

She has served in Hoboken public schools as a special education teacher for several years, working every day and advocating for students of all abilities. She also worked as a direct support provider at a Day Habilitation program, helping adults with traumatic brain injuries develop life skills and independence.

Her professional experience has shaped her understanding of the needs of working families, educators, longtime residents, and individuals who are often underserved. Caitlin brings a compassionate, hands-on perspective to public service, grounded in collaboration, listening, and practical problem-solving.
She attended Wallace Elementary School and The Mustard Seed School and is a graduate of The Hudson School. Caitlin earned her bachelor’s degree from William Paterson University and a master’s degree in Elementary Education from Montclair State University.
Caitlin lives in Hoboken with her husband, Arad, and their daughter. Deeply rooted in the community, she remains committed to strengthening Hoboken’s quality of life through thoughtful, inclusive, and responsive local governance.
