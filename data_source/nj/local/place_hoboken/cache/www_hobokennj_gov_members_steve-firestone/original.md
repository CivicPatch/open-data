Steve Firestone
---------------

Steve Firestone was initially elected to the Hoboken City Council in 2025. He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and grew up in Princeton, New Jersey. Steve currently serves as the Chair of the Department of Business and as an Associate Teaching Professor of Finance at Drew University. Previously, Steve worked for nine years in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury) as a Team Leader and Bank Examiner on the resident teams of Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and UBS. Prior to his tenure in the federal service, Steve was a fixed income portfolio manager, trader, and investment banker at numerous financial institutions.  
  
Steve and his wife, Kerri, bought their first apartment in Hoboken on Bloomfield Street in 1997. While they have traveled the country for different jobs, they have always thought of Hoboken as home. Steve served on Hoboken’s Zoning Board of Adjustment for six years, elected by his peers as ZBA Chairman from 2024-2025. On the Zoning Board, Steve has been an advocate for environmentally resilient and affordable housing development and new public spaces throughout Hoboken. He was also active in Hoboken through the Hoboken Harriers (HOHAs), which encouraged Steve to run two NYC TCS Marathons (2017-2018). Both of Steve and Kerri’s children, Amelia and Matthew, graduated high school from the Hudson School in Hoboken and live in the area.  
  
Steve graduated from Bucknell University in 1994 with a B.A. in Economics, and earned an M.B.A. degree in Finance from Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business in 2000.
