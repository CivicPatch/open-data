Diane Imus
----------

Diane Imus was elected as Hoboken City Council Sixth Ward representative  in a special election to fill out the remaining two years of Councilwoman Jennifer Giattino’s term. Diane was born in Hoboken, lived in Guttenberg and then Lincroft, NewJersey.  She moved back to Hoboken after graduating from Fordham University, with her husband Jay.  Diane worked in professional publishing and spent a good deal of her career working at John Wiley & Sons in Hoboken,where she rose to be a Director in Corporate Marketing and led a global team. After Wiley, she consulted part time for a number of companies, focusing on events,training, technology, and messaging. She and her husband Jay have lived in the Sixth Ward since 1999, in the same house where they raised their three children.

Diane has always volunteered. At Fordham, she co-founded the Mexico Project and worked in the South Bronx with under served children. In college she worked with the Governor’s office (NY) on a special initiative, the Foster Care Youth Independent Project, where she recruited and trained volunteers to teach independent living skills to foster children. She later returned to this calling to serve as a Court Appointed Special Advocate for foster children in Hudson County.  After moving to Hoboken, she became involved in the many open space initiatives,including developments on 1600 park, and for Union Dry Dock. She served as a founding member of the Hoboken Arts Advisory Council and was instrumental in creating the current Garage B Mural, Hoboken’s largest public art installation.

Hoboken will be Diane’s home for life.
