### City of Hoboken Inaugurates Emily B. Jabbour as 40th Mayor

The City of Hoboken celebrated a historic milestone today as Emily B. Jabbour was inaugurated as the 40th Mayor of Hoboken during a ceremony at the DeBaun Auditorium at Stevens Institute of Technology. The auditorium was filled to capacity with residents, community leaders, and dignitaries, and the event was also streamed to City Hall, the Hoboken Library, and viewers at home, marking the beginning of a new chapter in the City’s leadership.

Governor‑elect Mikie Sherrill presided over the ceremonial oath, underscoring the strong partnership between Hoboken and the State of New Jersey. The ceremony also included the swearing‑in of three at‑large members of the Hoboken City Council.

[Councilwoman Caitlin Layson](https://www.hobokennj.gov/members/caitlin-layson)
, and incumbent
[Councilman Joe Quintero](https://www.hobokennj.gov/members/joe-quintero)
, who each took the oath of office and affirmed their commitment to serving the community.

Several speakers offered remarks throughout the program including Congressman Rob Menendez, State Senator Raj Mukherji, and Angela Ferrell-Zabala the Executive Director of Moms Demand Action who highlighted Mayor Jabbour’s early volunteer leadership with the organization and her longstanding dedication to preventing gun violence.

In her inaugural address,
[Mayor Jabbour](https://www.hobokennj.gov/departments/mayor-emily-b-jabbour)
expressed deep gratitude to the people of Hoboken for their trust and support and outlined a forward‑looking vision for a safer, cleaner, more affordable, and more welcoming city. She emphasized her commitment to collaboration, transparency, and meaningful engagement with residents, highlighting priorities such as strengthening public safety and social services, investing in infrastructure and technology, and ensuring that Hoboken’s government remains accessible, and responsive. She also underscored the importance of working closely with the City Council to deliver meaningful progress for all residents.

Mayor Jabbour’s remarks also reflected the experience she brings to the role. A Hoboken resident since 2008, and two term at-Large Councilwoman, she has spent nearly two decades in federal public service with the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, beginning her career as a Presidential Management Fellow and later serving as Performance Officer in the Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation. Born in Boston and raised in Wellesley, she holds a B.A. in Psychology from Boston College and a Master of Science in Social Work with a policy focus and Law Minor from Columbia University. She now lives on Hoboken’s west side with her husband, Peter Jabbour, and their two daughters, who attend Hoboken Public Schools.

Drawing on this blend of professional expertise and deep community roots, Mayor Jabbour also emphasized her commitment to responsive government, responsible fiscal management, and policies that ensure Hoboken remains a vibrant place to live, work, and raise a family during her inaugural address.

Today’s ceremony marked the official start of Mayor Jabbour’s administration. The following are Mayor Jabbour’s remarks as prepared for delivery:

*Thank you to everyone here today, and to those joining us via livestream at City Hall and at the Hoboken Public Library, or on your couch at home. It means so much to see so many people gathered together for this moment.*

*I want to thank Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill for being here today. I am excited to work closely with her and her administration, and grateful for the example she sets for women in leadership.*

*Governor - I am honored to join you on this journey.  And to the other elected officials here today - especially Congressman Menendez, Senator Mukherji, Senator and Mayor Stack, Mayor Solomon, Mayor Grillo, Mayor Turner, Assemblywoman Katie Brennan, Assemblyman Ravi Bhalla, County Executive Craig Guy, Commissioner Chair Anthony Romano, and former longtime Senator Bernie Kenny - thank you. I will tell you this right now - you have a partner in me and you have a partner in Hoboken.*

*Thank you to Mayor Dawn Zimmer for joining us today - as I always joke, you got me into this mess - so I am proud to stand here today as the second woman to serve as mayor, following your example as our first.*

*To Mayor Dave Roberts - thank you for always sharing your thoughts and ideas with me - even when I didn’t ask for them. I appreciate you.*

*I also want to thank Beth McGrath and the entire Stevens Institute of Technology community for welcoming us today. Stevens is synonymous with the City of Hoboken. It is woven into our history, our skyline, and our future. I am incredibly excited to build upon our already strong partnership and continue working together in ways that benefit both the city and the Stevens community.*

*Thank you to Angela for being part of today’s event - my journey here today began in so many ways with my work volunteering as part of Moms Demand Action. You, Shannon Watts, and so many other incredible women have been mentors for me and gave me the courage to believe that I could have a seat at this table.*

*Now, as Mayor, I am proud to work with Moms Demand Action and Everytown in a new capacity - and so today, I am proud to join the Mayors Against Illegal Guns network as a first step to addressing gun violence.*

*I also want to take a moment to thank all of the incredible men and women who work for the City of Hoboken - for embracing this change and helping ensure a smooth transition so that today and the next four years get off to a strong start. After eight years serving on the City Council, I know just how special the people who work for the City are - and as a lifelong federal employee, I appreciate that special role of public service. You do your work without much fanfare, but you are the ones who keep us safe, plow our streets, clean our parks, coach our kids, and keep this city running every single day.*

*My administration will continue to invest in you and elevate your work, because your success is our success. When city staff are supported and respected, residents feel it in their everyday lives.*

*Standing here today is both an honor and a responsibility that I take very seriously. I am grateful for the trust you have placed in me, and I take this oath with humility, optimism, and a deep commitment to serving every resident of Hoboken.*

*I can vividly recall my freshman orientation at Boston College and my introduction to the concept of being “men and women for others.” This short and powerful statement has helped to guide me in both my personal and professional life. From my volunteer work, to my career in social work, and my tenure on the City Council - I have always worked to be a woman for others. I will carry that mission of service as I take on the responsibility of being your Mayor.*

*Hoboken is a special place. It is a city defined not just by its location or its views, but by its people. When 60K people live in one square mile, that can create challenges - and the opportunity to be in such close proximity with our neighbors. Hoboken is a community that shows up for each other, time and time again. It is about Hoboken neighbors checking in on one another after a storm; parents cheering together from the sidelines; small business owners who open their doors early and stay late; a food pantry that started as a small grassroots effort serving one building that now feeds hundreds of families every week.*

*I am honored today that we are joined by some of the amazing leaders that power those social service organizations - people who quietly do the work of connecting with those in need and supporting others: the Hoboken Community Center, the Hoboken Shelter, St Matthew’s Lunchtime Ministry, Streetlife Ministry, 10Reazons Youth Center, Community Lifestyles, the Boys & Girls Club, and so many more.*

*Today represents a transition and an opportunity to move forward together in a new way. Every new administration has a responsibility to ask new questions, to reassess what is working and what is not, and to approach the future with clarity and purpose.*

*My leadership philosophy is straightforward. I believe in public service, humility, and not coming to decisions without listening first. I believe that good ideas are not proprietary to one person, one office, or one party. They come from residents, from city staff, from community leaders, from City Council members, and from people who experience the impact of our decisions every day. They also come from earnest and sincere engagement, beyond a check-the-box exercise.*

*We are also going to radically change the way we communicate with all of you. I promise you a government that is accessible and engages in two-way conversations, because I never want there to be a moment when you feel blindsided about why we are doing something. And that means it will not just be Nixles and press releases. It will be videos, town halls, open office hours, and ward meetings. We are going to engage with you, to show you what we are doing, explain why we are doing it, and we are going to ask for your feedback along the way.*

*Hoboken is a sophisticated and complex city. And we are capable of achieving many different goals if we work together.*

*We can and we will invest in technology and data that make our city more resilient, while also ensuring that our streets are paved, maintained, and cared for on a regular basis.*

*We can and we will do the small things that local government must do well every single day, while also aspiring to be innovative and transformational.*

*A city that is clean and well cared for, where public spaces reflect pride and respect for our community.*

*A city that is safe, where families, seniors, and children feel secure in their neighborhoods and parks, and confident in the services that protect them - now especially, when we are watching news stories of masked federal agents barging into our homes, schools, and stores to separate our families.*

*A city that is affordable, where renters can stay, homeowners can plan for the future, and small businesses can thrive.*

*And a city that is welcoming and transparent, where everyone feels seen, heard, and valued.*

*And a city that invests in its people, its schools, and its infrastructure to ensure that we take care of today while we plan for tomorrow.*

*These are not abstract goals. They are the tenets of a city that works. They reflect the kind of city I want to live in, and the kind of city I know we can continue to build together.*

*I want to take a moment to acknowledge the new city council members who will be serving alongside me.*

*Joe, congratulations on your reelection. Thank you for continuing to step up and serve this city.  You have been a thought-partner and a friend and I am excited to continue to get to work together.*

*Caitlin and Steve, thank you for raising your hands and putting yourselves forward. You each have a unique voice and perspective to bring to the City Council and I look forward to working together on behalf of Hoboken.*

*And Diane Imus, although under very unique and tragic circumstances, thank you for stepping up and helping to move Hoboken forward.*

*To my former colleagues on the City Council: I know how deeply each of you cares about this community. I have served alongside you, debated with you, and worked with you. And I believe strongly that we are going to work together in a new and collaborative way, grounded in mutual respect and trust, powered by a shared commitment to doing what is best for Hoboken.*

*Although I am now Mayor and there will be a number of changes, I can promise that certain things will not change. You will still see me at Fit Foundry working out. You will still see me at the Hive grabbing a cup of coffee. You will see me at the farmers market and out enjoying all that Hoboken has to offer.*

*My passion as a City Council member came from the fact that I am energized by each and every interaction with a neighbor - and a strong sense of purpose in being a woman for others.  That will not change now that I am mayor. If you see me out, please say hello. I want to hear from you.*

*My promise to you is this. I will show up every day ready to listen, ready to work, and ready to lead with optimism and purpose. I will never forget that this job is about service, not a title, and progress, not politics.*

*I am honored to serve as your mayor. I am excited for what lies ahead. And I cannot wait to get to work alongside all of you.*
