Mayor Ravi S. Bhalla today thanked the Hoboken City Council for officially adopting the Hoboken Trust Act, a landmark ordinance that codifies the City’s commitment to being a Fair and Welcoming City for all residents, regardless of immigration status.

The new law makes permanent the protections originally established under Mayor Bhalla’s 2018 executive order, ensuring that Hoboken will not use local resources to assist in federal civil immigration enforcement, will prohibit bias-based profiling, and will guarantee equal access to municipal services for everyone in the community.

The Hoboken Trust Act prohibits city officials from honoring ICE detainer requests or sharing sensitive personal information without a valid judicial criminal warrant. It also limits inquiries into a person’s immigration status by municipal employees, unless explicitly required by law.

“I want to sincerely thank the Hoboken City Council members who voted for adopting the Hoboken Trust Act and officially codifying our Fair and Welcoming City policies into law,”
**said Mayor Ravi S. Bhalla.**
“With this vote, Hoboken reaffirms its unwavering commitment to protecting the rights and dignity of all residents, regardless of immigration status. This law will help preserve trust between our immigrant communities and local government, ensuring that Hoboken remains a safe, inclusive, and welcoming city for everyone.”

Councilmembers Phil Cohen, Tiffanie Fisher, Emily Jabbour, Joe Quintero, Ruben Ramos, Michael Russo voted in favor of adopting the ordinance while Councilman Jim Doyle abstained and Councilman Paul Presinzano voted against the ordinance’s adoption.
