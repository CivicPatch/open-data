Michael Russo
-------------

Dr. Michael Russo, DPT, the longest-serving Council member in Hoboken history, is proudly Hoboken born and raised. A graduate of Hoboken High, Michael earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from Richard Stockton University, Master of Science degree in Physical Therapy from Rutgers University (formally UMDNJ) and Doctor of Physical Therapy degree from Utica College.

Dr. Russo learned the importance of service to his community early in life, first as an Eagle Scout who alwayshelped others, then as a volunteer PAL football coach, assistant scoutmaster,and supplemental education instructor, and then as a physical therapist.  He has provided
physical therapy care for athletes at all levels, including the football program at Hoboken High School and the Israeli national ice dance team.

Originally a member of the Hoboken Zoning Board of Adjustment, Dr. Russo was elected as the Third Ward Council man in 2003, and has served as Council President and Vice President. As a fierce defender of tenants, he was elected to serve as a commissioner of the Hoboken Housing Authority and has fought to revolutionize public housing, expand veteran housing, and ensure equitable rent prices. A staunch believer in transportation and traffic safety, he has introduced legislation to regulate e-bike delivery drivers. Russo's advocacy has also resulted in new parks and recreation spaces in the Third Ward, including are volutionary community and flood detention park that was once doomed to become a DPW garage.

Dr. Russo has also served multiple nonprofit organizations, such as the Madeline Fiadini LoRe Foundation, where he is an advisory board member and raises money to provide cancer screenings for those who lack access.

Dr. Russo married his wife, Lisa, in2009. Lisa is a registered dietitian, certified specialist in pediatric nutrition, and proud mother. Michael and Lisa are raising their four beautiful children: Lia Grace, Jack Anthony, and twins Michele Stella and Michael Dean.

Dr. Russo’s primary drive in lifehas always been the love for his family and his faith in God. He is committed to treating his constituents like family and invites residents tolearn more about the issues that matter most on his website,schedule an office hours appointment via Calendly, send him an email, or text with concerns at
