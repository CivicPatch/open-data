Most of the Council’s legislative work is done in committee. It is there that proposed legislation is initially debated and the members of other government branches and the public are given a chance to comment. Each Council Member serves on at least two (2) of the Council’s seven (7) standing committees. You can view the full list and download the list of the committee members
.

Public Notices will be provided to the local media and posted outside of the City Clerk’s office bulletin boards.

The Council typically meets on the first and third Wednesday of each month at 7 pm in the Council Chambers at City Hall and only once a month in the month of July and August.
