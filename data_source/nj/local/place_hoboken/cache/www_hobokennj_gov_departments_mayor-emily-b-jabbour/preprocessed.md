Emily (Ball) Jabbour was elected to be the 40th Mayor of the City of Hoboken on December 2, 2025. Emily was previously elected to the Hoboken City Council as a Councilmember-at-Large on November 7, 2017, and was re-elected to a second 4-year term on November 2, 2021.

Emily has lived in Hoboken since the fall of 2008. Emily was born in Boston, Massachusetts and grew up in the Boston suburb of Wellesley. For over 19 years, she proudly worked as a civil servant for the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF). Emily began her federal career through the Presidential Management Fellows program and completed a six-month detail assignment with the United States House of Representatives as a Health Fellow for the Committee on Energy and Commerce, Health Subcommittee. During her time at ACF, Emily served as the Performance Officer as part of the Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation (OPRE) and was project officer on a number of contracts.

Emily’s leadership is grounded in collaboration and transparency. She believes local government works best when residents are engaged, voices are heard, and decisions are guided by both data and compassion. Throughout her time in office, she has worked closely with neighborhood groups, small businesses, seniors, parents, and community organizations to deliver meaningful progress. As Mayor, Emily is focused on building a Hoboken that is safe, inclusive, and forward-looking—one that honors its rich history while preparing for the challenges of the future. Her administration is committed to responsive government, responsible fiscal management, and policies that ensure Hoboken remains a great place to live, work, and raise a family.

Emily graduated from Boston College in 2003 with a B.A. in Psychology, and graduated from Columbia’s School of Social Work in 2006 with a Master of Science in Social Work with a policy focus and Law Minor. Emily is the proud parent of two daughters who attend schools in the Hoboken Public School District, and the wife of lifelong Jersey resident Peter Jabbour, Head of Legal for the Americas for Maersk. Emily can be found riding her bike around Hoboken, drinking coffee at any number of local coffee shops, working out regularly at Fit Foundry, volunteering every other Friday at the Hoboken Community Center Food Pantry, and walking her dog.
