Manuel Figueiredo is currently serving his third term as Mayor. Since his election to the Committee, Mayor Figueiredo has focused his attention on a number of initiatives to improve the quality of life of those who live and work within the Township of Union. Past committee assignments include the Department of Public Works, Building, Licensing, Purchasing, Fire Department, Police Department, Recreation and Senior Services.

Mayor Figueiredo was a driving force behind the new Senior Center, an 11,000 square-foot property that has also expanded the number of health, recreational, and wellness activities for those to partake in. The Mayor has also made public safety a priority, and in 2022, introduced S.P.E.E.D. as a traffic enforcement initiative to better protect pedestrians and motorists alike. Mayor Figueiredo has also pushed for more aggressive signage and speed monitoring sensors in key areas around the Township of Union, as well as enhanced truck enforcement crackdowns.

Mayor Figueiredo also worked with key investors for the new Union Public Library, which represents a true investment in the Township. The library, which is slated to open in the Spring of 2025, will be home to classrooms, a business center, an art gallery, a covered patio, sensory rooms, a recording studio, private study rooms, and a black box theater.

Mayor Figueiredo and the Township Committee have also partnered with various local, County, and State officials to improve and beautify the Townships’ many parks and sports complexes. Following a $10M investment, 2023 saw the grand opening of Rabkin Sports Complex, which now includes a multi-use, high-end turf field, new lighting, seating, walking paths, and landscaping. The project also includes a new Rams football building, new turf for the Union High School Football Field, and upgraded lighting and field turf for Conlon Soccer Field.

Mayor Figueiredo is a former Newark public school teacher, and is also a professional singer and pianist. He holds a Bachelor’s and Master’s Degree in Education from Kean University, and has pursued non-degree graduate studies in Education from Montclair State University, and in Computer Information Systems from the New Jersey Institute of Technology.

 Mayor Figueiredo and his wife, Rosa, have four children, who are all products of the Township of Union Public School System.
