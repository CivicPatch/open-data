Responsibilities
----------------

Union operates under a "Township" form of government, consisting of 5 members of a Township Committee, elected at-large for staggered 3-year terms. Elections are held annually. The Township Committee members also act as liaisons to the various departments of the municipal government. The Township Committee elects from its members the Mayor for a 1-year term. The Mayor, in addition to voting as a member of the Township Committee, presides over the meetings of the committee and carries out ceremonial duties. The Mayor can be reached at (908) 851-8500.
