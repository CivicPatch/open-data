BMAC Offers Sports Saturday for Young People
============================================

The Brick Municipal Alliance Committee (BMAC) is proud to once again offer the Sport Saturday program for township boys and girls ages 9 through 12.  The program offers young athletes 90-minute training sessions designed to help them achieve their personal best physically, mentally and emotionally in both sports and life.

Sport Saturday sessions are available every Saturday from March 22 through June 21 at the Brick Civic Plaza.  Sessions are at either 8:30am or 10:30am.  The program is free for participants.  Parents can register their children for one or more sessions.  There is a limit of 30 children at each session.

Each Sport Saturday training session is 90 minutes. Sport Saturday provides enhancement of general fitness levels, sports specific training, and the importance of leadership qualities, problem solving and character development designed to help youth increase self-esteem, awareness and resiliency as substance use prevention strategies.

"This program has been a tremendous benefit to families across Brick," said Mayor Lisa Crate. "Over the years, hundreds of children have taken part, gaining valuable skills that support them both on the field and in life. We’re thrilled to continue our partnership with BMAC to keep bringing this opportunity to the youth of Brick Township."
Trainers are provided by Mentor Academy of New Jersey and are certified physical education teachers as well as youth sports trainers.
BMAC Coordinator Brandi White says programs like this are important in the effort to keep our youth healthy, safe and drug-free.  “The push for greater professionalism in youth sports has led to a rise in overuse-related orthopedic injuries among children aged 12 and older, often resulting in the prescription of opioid pain relievers. Research indicates that young athletes who are prescribed opioids before graduating high school face a 33% higher risk of recreational opioid use in the years following graduation, even among those who previously viewed drug use negatively,” says Ms. White.

Sport Saturday is funded through the BMAC grant provided by the Governor’s Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse (GCADA).

Register for Sport Saturday in the Recreation Office, 270 Chambers Bridge Road, Monday through Friday, 7:30am – 4pm or
