5th Annual Town-Wide Yard Sale to be Held May 17
================================================

Brick Township’s popular Town-Wide Yard Sale returns for its fifth year on Saturday, May 17, giving residents the perfect opportunity to declutter, find new treasures and connect with neighbors.

“The Town-Wide Yard Sale has become a favorite tradition in Brick,” said Mayor Lisa Crate. “This year, we’re making a change by holding the sale in the spring. It’s a great opportunity for residents to do some spring cleaning, clear out items they no longer need and hopefully make a little extra cash in the process.”
With a wide variety of participating sellers, shoppers can expect an extensive selection of items including clothing, furniture, electronics, antiques, toys, books, jewelry and more. Whether you're searching for household essentials or unique vintage finds, there’s something for everyone!
To help buyers navigate the sales, the Township will once again create an interactive Google map, which will be shared on the municipal website along with a list of participating homes.
Residents interested in selling can now register for just $5 per home. Suggested sale hours are 8 am – 2pm. Registration can be completed in person at the Township Clerk’s Office, 401 Chambers Bridge Road, Monday through Friday from 9am to 4pm. Sellers can also register by mail by downloading the registration form from the Brick Township website, including payment and a self-addressed, stamped envelope and sending it in. Participation counts toward the annual limit of four yard sales per address.

There is no rain date for this event. In case of inclement weather, participants may choose to hold their sales the following day. The deadline to register for inclusion in the sale is Wednesday, May 14.
Don’t miss this chance to clean out your home, earn some extra money, and take part in a great community event!
