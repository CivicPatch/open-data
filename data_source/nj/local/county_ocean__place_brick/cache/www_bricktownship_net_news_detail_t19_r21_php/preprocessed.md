Held each February at the Civic Plaza, the Brick Birthday Party is an annual tradition hosted by the Mayor’s Student Advisory Committee, which consists of students from Brick Township and Brick Memorial High Schools. The event originated in 2016 after an elementary school student suggested the idea.

This year’s celebration featured games, activities, and exhibits from local organizations. The Brick Township Historical Society provided a special highlight, showcasing artifacts and stories from Brick’s 175-year history. Members of the society dressed in period costumes, and even Mayor Crate joined in the fun by wearing one herself.
No birthday party is complete without cake! Attendees sang “Happy Birthday” to Brick Township and enjoyed delicious birthday cakes.
Participating groups and businesses included the Mayor’s Student Advisory Committee, Brick Township Historical Society, Brick Memorial High School Art Club, Ocean County Vocational Technical School-Culinary Program, HMH Ocean University Hospital, Ocean County Library-Brick Branch, BTMUA, Brick Township Police Department, Brick EMS, Brick Fire Bureau, Chick-fil-A of Brick, Michael’s, the Brick Garden Club, the Environmental Commission, the Brick PAL and Brick PBA Chapter 230.

Goody bags were generously provided by BMAC, DART, Sundaes of Point Pleasant, Meals on Wheels and Willow Springs.
