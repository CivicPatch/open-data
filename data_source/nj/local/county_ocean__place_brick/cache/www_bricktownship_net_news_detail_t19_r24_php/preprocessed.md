Brick Recreation’s girls’ softball and t-ball leagues provide an exciting opportunity for young athletes to learn and enjoy the game in a fun, supportive and team-oriented environment. Whether they are picking up a bat for the first time or building on existing skills, players will benefit from a well-rounded program that emphasizes teamwork, sportsmanship and skill development.
Designed to accommodate players at different skill levels, the program offers a solid foundation for beginners while also helping more experienced athletes sharpen their abilities and prepare for more competitive play as they grow. The leagues foster a positive atmosphere where players can develop confidence, make new friends and enjoy the sport.
T-ball is for girls in grades K-2. Softball is open to girls in grades 2-12, with player assessments scheduled for March. These assessments are required for new players and those moving up to a different division to ensure fair and balanced team placement. Details regarding the specific date, time and location of the assessments will be sent via email to registered participants. Players in the 2nd and 3rd grade division do not need to attend an assessment, as there are no tryouts for this age group.

The registration fee covers a 12-game season, playoffs, and a team t-shirt. Games will be held on weekday evenings, providing a convenient schedule for families. The season officially kicks off on Friday, April 4.

Don’t miss out on this fantastic opportunity for your child to develop their skills, stay active, and experience the camaraderie of team sports. Register today and be part of the fun!
Register in the Recreation Office, 270 Chambers Bridge Road, Monday through Friday, 7:30am – 4pm or
