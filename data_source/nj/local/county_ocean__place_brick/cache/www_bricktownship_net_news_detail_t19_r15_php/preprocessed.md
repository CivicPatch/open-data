Mayor Discusses Do Not Knock Registry
=====================================

In this Mayor’s Minute, Mayor Lisa Crate discusses Brick Township’s Do Not Knock Registry. This free service allows residents to opt out of door-to-door solicitations. Any business or group that obtains a solicitor’s permit from the Clerk’s Office receives the registry, ensuring they do not visit registered homes.
