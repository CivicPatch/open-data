Brooks **Term of Office:   First Elected To Council: Dec. 2, 2025   Current Term Expires: January 14, 2030** |

Before being elected to the Ward B seat, Joel Brooks had worked in the labor movement for twenty years. He has organized with members of the UAW, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, SEIU District 1199, and, for the last twelve years here in NJ, HPAE, the largest healthcare workers union in New Jersey. Born in Honduras and raised in a Jewish family, he attended New York University, where he attained a BA in American History. He and his partner, Marisol, a registered nurse, along with their newborn daughter, Esme, have made their home on the welcoming, diverse West Side of Jersey City. As a former longtime rent control tenant, Joel will fight to maintain affordable housing for all Jersey City residents, renters and homeowners alike.
