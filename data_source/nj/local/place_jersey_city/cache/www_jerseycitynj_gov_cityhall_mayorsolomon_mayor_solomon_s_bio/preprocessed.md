Mayor James S. Solomon
======================

![Mayor Solomon](https://cdnsm5-hosted.civiclive.com/UserFiles/Servers/Server_6189660/Image/City%20Hall/Mayor's%20Office/Biography%20of%20the%20Mayor/8f545972-e6fd-4bb0-8465-a19b1cb949e6.jpeg "Mayor Solomon")

James Slater Solomon is a father, educator, public servant, and cancer survivor. On January 15, 2026, he was sworn in as the 50th Mayor of Jersey City following a historic election that delivered a decisive mandate for change in New Jersey's second-largest city.
James was first elected to the Jersey City Council in 2017 in an upset victory against the political machine. On the Council, he built a reputation as a tireless advocate for working families, fighting for affordable housing, stable property taxes, and an end to sweetheart deals for developers. His commitment has always been to make Jersey City a place that supports all our families—not just the well-connected.
James met the love of his life, Gabrielle Ramos-Solomon, in graduate school, where they bonded over a shared commitment to making the world a better place. They married in August 2015. Two months later, James was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Today, he is blessed to be completely healthy.
James earned his Master's in Public Policy from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and his Bachelor of Arts from Pomona College. He has proudly served as an adjunct professor at New Jersey City University, St. Peter’s University, and Hudson County Community College, where he has helped prepare the next generation of public servants.
As Mayor, James is committed to turning the page on corruption and delivering a government that works for the people of Jersey City—making the city more affordable, improving public safety, fixing basic services, and creating opportunity for every resident.
James and Gaby are the proud parents of three beautiful daughters.
