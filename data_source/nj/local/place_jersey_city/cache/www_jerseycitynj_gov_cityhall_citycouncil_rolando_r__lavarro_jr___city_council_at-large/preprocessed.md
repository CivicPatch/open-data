Lavarro, Jr. **Term of Office:   First Elected To Council: Dec. 2, 2025   Current Term Expires: January 14, 2030** |

Rolando Lavarro made history in 2011 as Jersey City's first Asian American and Filipino American councilman, going on to serve as Council President from 2013 to 2019. During his decade on the Council, he championed landmark legislation including New Jersey's first earned sick days ordinance, wage theft protections, and the establishment of the state's first local Immigrant Affairs Commission. After breaking with the political establishment over affordable housing and government accountability, Lavarro lost his seat in 2021—but refused to abandon his commitment to Jersey City's working families. In 2025, he joined James Solomon's slate and was the top vote-getter among all Council At-Large candidates, earning a decisive mandate from voters. A 48-year resident of Greenville, Lavarro lives with his wife and daughter and remains dedicated to building a Jersey City where every family can afford to stay.
