Message from the Mayor
======================




**Greetings and welcome to The City of New Brunswick’s website!**

As Mayor, I’m pleased to offer this website as a gateway to all the wonderful resources and opportunities our City has to offer. Known as “The Hub City” and “The Healthcare City,” New Brunswick is a place where paths cross, journeys begin, and purpose is found. Our diverse community welcomes all, whether you’re visiting or calling it home.

New Brunswick is uniquely positioned, offering seamless access to major transportation hubs, world-class healthcare, renowned dining, cutting-edge research, a thriving arts district, and the excitement of a Big 10 university. We’re committed not just to attracting new residents and businesses but also to improving the quality of life for every member of our community.

As the home of Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, along with Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, the Jack and Sheryl Morris Cancer Center, the Helix NJ Health and Life Science Exchange, Saint Peter’s University Hospital, and Johnson & Johnson, our City is a leader in healthcare and education, with a focus on creating even more healthy living opportunities.

The strength and vitality of New Brunswick are rooted in our evolving and dynamic community. I encourage you to take advantage of all our City has become, explore its vast opportunities, and never hesitate to reach out to my office with your questions at (732) 745-5004.

Also, be sure to check the Community Calendar and follow the City of New Brunswick on Facebook, Instagram, and X for the latest news, events, and updates. There is always something new in New Brunswick; we want you to be part of it all!

Very truly yours,
JIM CAHILL
