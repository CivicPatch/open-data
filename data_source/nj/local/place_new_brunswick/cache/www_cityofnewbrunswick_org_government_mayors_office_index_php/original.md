**James M. Cahill is the 62nd Mayor of the City of New Brunswick.** He is a lifelong City resident and has served continuously as Mayor since 1991. During his tenure, New Brunswick has experienced an unprecedented wave of growth and investment that has transformed this once declining industrial city into a thriving 21st century urban center. To accomplish this, Mayor Cahill spurred collaborations among the private sector, the City’s health institutions, Rutgers University, Middlesex County, and the City’s redevelopment partner, the New Brunswick Development Corporation, to propel more than $7 billion in overall investment for the construction of residential, retail, office, educational and healthcare facilities.  
  
**Economic Success**Today, these projects provide significant tax relief to homeowners by generating more than $25 million in annual revenue to support government and community services and public schools. Mayor Cahill also worked to create new housing and homeownership opportunities throughout the City and provide critical funds for low-and-moderate-income residents to make needed repairs to their existing homes. Since Mayor Cahill took office, more than 5000 market-rate and affordable homes have been built or rehabilitated, helping New Brunswick become one of New Jersey’s fastest growing urban communities. These economic successes have fueled tremendous job growth in New Brunswick, with more than 7,000 new jobs created for City residents over the past 10 years. All of this has led to New Brunswick sustaining one of the lowest tax rates in Middlesex County year after year.  
  
**Healthcare**Under Mayor Cahill, New Brunswick has emerged as the State’s premier Health Care City. New Brunswick is home to internationally renowned researchers, practitioners and facilities including Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, Saint Peter’s University Hospital, the Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, the Jack and Sheryl Morris Cancer Center, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Children’s Hospital, the PSE&G Children’s Specialized Hospital and the Helix NJ Health and Life Sciences Exchange. Key partnerships have resulted in a dynamic outreach network that brings its health care services directly into City neighborhoods serving the most vulnerable populations.  
  
**Public Safety**New Brunswick has also experienced an unprecedented drop in crime with the number of crimes cut in half since the Mayor took office. Mayor Cahill has increased the size of the New Brunswick Police Department and expanded its mission by instituting programs such as DARE, GREAT, Crime Watch, National Night Out, Community Policing Units, bicycle patrols, and the Marine Patrol Unit. The New Brunswick Police Department has also achieved accreditation through the New Jersey State Association of Chiefs of Police in 2013, and has been re-accredited every three years since. Accreditation ensures that the police department adheres to the best policies and practices in the nation.  
  
**Parks, Open Space, and Programs**Mayor Cahill has coordinated the preservation of open space and the development of new parks and recreational facilities for all ages such as Recreation Park, the Youth Sports Complex, Alice Jennings Archibald Park, the Raritan River Conservation Area, the HUB Teen Center and the expansion of the New Brunswick Senior Citizen Resource Center. Numerous existing City parks including Feaster Park, Pittman Park, Boyd Park, Joyce Kilmer Park and War Memorial Park have undergone significant renovations and upgrades, along with the addition of Park Rangers who serve as community ambassadors in our parks and recreation system. New Brunswick has also expanded its after-school programming in all its elementary schools. Mayor Cahill received the Community Leadership Award from the New Jersey School Aged Care Coalition for his strong support of after-school programs.  
  
**Public Education**Mayor Cahill has also worked to improve educational opportunities in New Brunswick.  He helped create an innovative school construction strategy for neighborhood redevelopment with the Lord Stirling School, a model for new school construction statewide. Following a similar strategy, the construction of the new New Brunswick High School began in 2007 with the doors opening to students in 2010.

In 2015, working with the state’s School Development Authority and the City’s Board of Education, Mayor Cahill opened the doors of the new 101,000 square foot A.C. Redshaw Elementary School and secured funding for a 60,500 square foot, three-story addition, plus renovations to the Paul Robeson Community School for the Arts; improvements that more than doubled the school’s size. Mayor Cahill was also instrumental in the opening of both the Greater Brunswick Charter School and the New Brunswick Health Sciences Technologies High School, the first school in New Jersey with a focus on training students for careers in the healthcare industry or to pursue an advanced degree in medical fields of study. The Blanquita Valenti Community School, constructed at no cost to taxpayers, provides City students with a modern learning environment.  The state-of-the-art P-TECH Campus continues to offer an opportunity to simultaneously earn both a high school diploma and an associate degree in Engineering or an Engineering-related field.  
  
**Personal Life**Mayor Cahill is a lifelong resident of New Brunswick. He was educated at St. Peter’s Elementary and High Schools and earned an Associate’s Degree from Middlesex County College. He went on to obtain a Bachelor of Science Degree in Law Justice from Glassboro State College (now Rowan University) and a Master’s Degree in Criminal Justice from Rutgers University. He obtained his Juris Doctorate from Seton Hall School of Law.  
  
His professional memberships include the New Jersey Bar Association, the Middlesex County Bar Association and the New Brunswick Bar Association, for which he is a past president. He is a past member of the New Jersey Supreme Court District Ethics Committee, and the New Jersey Supreme Court Committee on the Tax Court. Mayor Cahill’s public service career began in 1980 when he was named Assistant City Attorney for New Brunswick. He served in that capacity until he was sworn in as Mayor in January 1991.  
  
Mayor Cahill and his wife Laura are the proud parents of their daughter Rebecca and grandsons Colton and Harrison, and son Casey and daughter-in-law Lindsay.
