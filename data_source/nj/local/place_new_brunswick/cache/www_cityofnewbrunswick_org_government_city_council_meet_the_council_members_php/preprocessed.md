**Council Member Suzanne M. Sicora Ludwig**
Suzanne Sicora Ludwig was elected to the City Council on January 4, 2017, served as Vice President in 2019-2020, and in her second term was sworn in as President on January 6, 2021.
Having lived in the City of New Brunswick for over 22 years, Suzanne is no stranger to the community.  In addition, her familial ties run deep as her 103-year-old Grandmother Toth grew up on Hartwell Street and was married in St. Ladislaus Church in 1934 and her Great-Grandfather Toth owned Toth's Butcher Shop on George Street in the late 1800s.  Suzanne is not a member of any one parish but instead chooses to enjoy services at the many beautiful, historical places of worship throughout the City.
Educated at Rutgers University with concentrations in philosophy, political science, and religion, Suzanne also received the Anna I. Morgan scholarship in religion for a paper noting the contributions, and sometimes undervalued importance of the role of women in the history of theologies.  Later attending the New York Law School, she earned her Juris Doctor and continued her studies at NYLS toward a Legal Masters in Tax.
Suzanne has a background in corporate finance having worked for AT&T Finance and Merck Pharmaceuticals.  Today she is writing a book based on the experiences and widespread lasting effects of childhood sexual abuse in adults. Upon completion, the piece will serve as the basis for a Foundation which will provide pro bono legal and emotional support to survivors and their families. Suzanne is a firm believer in giving back to the community.  Her late husband proudly served as an EMT and firefighter in the City of New Brunswick for over 23 years until his accidental death in 2008.  Suzanne continued his civic tradition by being elected a Committeewoman in Ward 1 District 4 for the Middlesex County Democratic Organization in 2007 and has been re-elected each term to date.  She was also appointed to the Planning Board of the City of New Brunswick over 10 years ago and elected to positions of Vice Chair and Chair by her peers.
In her role as Planning Board Chair, Suzanne presided over the lengthiest and highly publicized Mine Street application where she was the deciding vote denying the project and forging a path for compromise between the neighborhood residents and the contractor. Applauding both sides for their patience and professionalism throughout the democratic process, she also reiterated, and echoes today, that she appreciates the need for growth within New Brunswick, but explicitly, not at the expense and integrity of the neighborhoods we call our home.
