             The continued planned construction off Riverton Boulevard will quickly translate into more revenue to Sayreville, helping to offset the local tax burden from a redevelopment project this community has waited decades to bear fruit.

             We expect many more groundbreaking events in the coming years.  My office receives phone calls daily from many other major investors across the country looking for opportunities in Sayreville. Everyone who I’ve spoken with about this progress is amazed and proud at how far we have come.

       We carefully balance each and every proposal we hear. We are only interested in projects that create jobs and stabilize taxes for the long-term, making our Borough more affordable for you.
       In short, in reviewing these projects we want to make sure any proposed use is a “good fit” for our community.
       We aggressively seek outside funding – beyond what is raised by taxpayers – to achieve many of the improvement projects you are seeing around town.
       It is amazing to see what can be accomplished  when we work closely with dedicated partners that share our vision for the future of an affordable, yet vibrant and safe, Sayreville.
       To that end, I would like to once again express my deepest appreciation to the commissioners of a reinvigorated Sayreville Economic Redevelopment Agency, which is ensuring that the right type of investment comes to our community.
       SERA and I share a vision when it comes to redevelopment: minimize impact and maximize returns for the people of Sayreville.
       SERA has identified several high-priority areas, one of which is the Hercules property.
       I would also like to provide an update about renovations to the historic firehouse next to this building. You may recall that borough voters approved a special referendum to fund these improvements.
       <p style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom:11px">

            <span style="color:black">
             So far, both an environmental remediation and a structural engineering assessment has been completed, with architectural designs being finalized in the coming weeks. Those plans will be presented to the Borough Council for review and approval, as we steadily move toward returning the building to public use.

       How fortuitous, as the aging trailers that house our construction and health departments have exceeded their useful life, and we must create appropriate space for their support of our community.
       We also continue to invest heavily in public safety, ensuring our emergency responders are equipped with the best tools and techniques available to keep us all protected.
       To that end, the Sayreville Police Department will be deploying an upgraded closed-circuit system that will enhance their ability to detect and prevent crime throughout the Borough.  I’d like to note this tremendous enhancement is being funded through the hefty fines paid by lawbreakers, not taxpayers.

             Allow me a moment to thank the many volunteers who are being appointed to municipal boards and commissions this year, as well as many other important positions around Sayreville. I’ve said it for years – and I will say it again today – volunteers are the backbone of this great community.

             In closing, I would like to once again thank the people of Sayreville for entrusting me in this important leadership role, as your mayor. I remain – and will always remain– deeply honored for your support and trust.
