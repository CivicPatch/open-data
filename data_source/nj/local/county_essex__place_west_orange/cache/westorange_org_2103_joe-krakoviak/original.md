Councilman Joe Krakoviak
------------------------

Joe Krakoviak will serve on the West Orange Township Council from 2025-2028. He can be reached by emailing [jkrakoviak@westorange.org](mailto:jkrakoviak@westorange.org).

### **Biography**

Joe served West Orange residents as a Township Councilman for 10 years, working to improve local government to make West Orange an even better place to live, work, visit, invest and raise a family.

Joe became active in local affairs with his creation of the non-partisan West Orange Grassroots website in 2009. Leveraging his journalism and municipal finance background, he focused on municipal government, particularly redevelopment, property taxes and the budget. The website featured online video of Council meetings along with time-indexing on issues to make it easier for residents to learn about their government – long before the town began posting Council meeting videos online. He subsequently retired the website and moved his prolific commentary to local Facebook pages.

On the Council, he pushed for more transparency and fiscal responsibility -- repeatedly questioning proposed contracts, excessive borrowing, revenue-reducing property-tax tax abatements, redevelopment and non-essential spending. He regularly advocated to solicit more resident input, especially on budget priorities and quality-of-life initiatives such as parks, recreation and open space. He frequently voted against what he considered wasteful or unnecessary actions, including the $12 million purchase of Rock Spring Club and tax abatements for Executive Drive and Downtown Redevelopment projects.

After two full terms, Joe left the Council at the end of 2020, declining to run for re-election due to his belief in the necessity of term limits for better governance responsive to residents. He’s running for Council again because he sees opportunity for further progress.

Among his Council accomplishments, Joe fought to introduce and pass legislation that sets requirements for publishing Council meeting agendas and proposed legislation on the website. A long-time opponent of further development at West Essex Highlands, he served on the joint committee that negotiated a settlement of affordable-housing litigation related to the undeveloped property on the site. That settlement – forced on municipalities by the State Supreme Court’s “Mount Laurel” decisions – significantly reduced the proposed footprint and limited the number of residential units, saves hundreds of trees, required significant environmental-friendly features, and began the process of restoring and protecting forest damaged by deer and improper usage.

Joe helped form a Downtown West Orange Alliance committee to boost the business-friendly nature of local government. He served for several years as the Council liaison to the West Orange Open Space and Recreation Committee, supporting the effort to acquire multiple properties to preserve open space, as well as liaison to the West Orange Historic Preservation Commission. He also advocated for the purchase and preservation of the Mount Pleasant forest as early as 2016 – a proposal opposed repeatedly by the mayor and Council majority. He advocated repeatedly for enforcement and strengthening of the town’s tree-protection ordinance.

A 21-year town resident, Joe is married to Clare Silvestri, who was born and raised in West Orange. They have three adult children. A former award-winning financial journalist who worked at USA Today and for other newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal, Joe extensively covered municipal finance and real estate development for more than a decade. As a marketing and public relations executive, he worked six years for a company that insured municipal bonds, managed municipal funds and provided tax services to the public sector. After seven years with a leading management consulting company, he was an independent marketing and public relations consultant and most recently a technology writer. He earned a bachelor’s degree in journalism, with concentrations in economics and finance, from the University of Georgia.
