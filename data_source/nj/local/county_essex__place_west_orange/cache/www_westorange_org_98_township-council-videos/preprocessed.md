   The Entire West Orange Township Council can be reached in a single email at:

   [council@westorange.org](mailto:council@westorange.org)

   The public should be advised that the following Township officials listed below are also in receipt of emails sent to this address.

   * Mayor
   * Senior Policy Advisor to the Mayor/Chief of Police

   The public should be further advised that all incoming and outgoing email communications can be made available to the public under the Open Public Records Act (OPRA). No assumption should be made that these email communications are private, privileged, or confidential. The safest course of action when communicating by email is to avoid situations that could potentially embarrass the writer if emails were subsequently made public under OPRA.

   Individual emails can be sent to just specific Council members but are subject to the same OPRA conditions as stated above.
