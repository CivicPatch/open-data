### Milady Tejeda, Council President

![image](https://cdnsm5-hosted.civiclive.com/UserFiles/Servers/Server_11204924/Image/Council/Council%20Member%20Milady%20Tejeda/mtejeda_biopic.png "image")
For more than 30 years, Milady Tejeda has called the City of Perth Amboy home. Born in the Dominican Republic, Milady immigrated to the United States at the age of 15 and understood the values of hard work and education. Earning degrees from Middlesex County College and Kean University, Milady has spent the bulk of her career in healthcare coordinating IT systems in addition to overseeing laboratory operations. Currently, Milady supervises 3 departments at RWJ Barnabas Health at Rahway.
Raising her two sons in Perth Amboy, Milady took an active interest in their education which evolved into 8 years on the Perth Amboy Board of Education, a position which started when she was appointed to in 2010 for a year and elected for the rest of her tenure. Following years of advocacy and hard work on the Board of Education, Milady sought to assist Perth Amboy residents in a more expansive way and successfully ran for City Council in 2018 becoming the city's first Dominican woman to be elected to Council. Aside from her public service.
Milady is also President of the Hijos de la Altagracia at Our Lady of Fatima, an active member of the Parish Council and a member of United Dominicans of Perth Amboy. Councilwoman Tejeda feels honored to represent the residents of Perth Amboy, her town and her community.
