### Kenneth Puccio, Council Member

![image](https://cdnsm5-hosted.civiclive.com/UserFiles/Servers/Server_11204924/Image/Council/2023/CM_Ken%20Puccio.png "image")
Born and raised in Perth Amboy, Ken Puccio is a veteran, retired Perth Amboy Police Officer, and current President of the Perth Amboy Board of Education. A proud product of Perth Amboy Public Schools, Ken graduated from Perth Amboy High School in 1974 and then enlisted in the U.S. Army, where he served four years on active duty and spent another eight years in the Army Reserves.
After returning home from his Army Service, Ken became a Perth Amboy Police Officer, who served for 17 years as a Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) Officer teaching and inspiring more than 4,000 students to lead healthy and prosperous lives. Throughout his career as a Police Officer, Ken has been recognized many times as Police Officer of the Year and earned several distinctions and valor awards. Ken has been accredited by other police departments and law enforcement agencies such as the N.Y.P.D., F.B.I., New Jersey State Police, and New Jersey Attorney General's Office.
A fervent believer in community service, especially for our youth, Ken served the Middlesex County Youth Services Commission, as a board member for the Middlesex County Minorities Issues Committee, and on the Attorney General's working group on stationhouse adjustments. Ken served on the School Leadership Committees of Shull, Ceres, and Perth Amboy High School.
Following his passion for public service, Ken was elected to the Perth Amboy Board of Education in 2009, where he served as Vice President from 2010-2013, and was elected President in 2017.
Councilman Puccio represents the best of Perth Amboy, and his dedication to the city as an advocate, officer, and leader is unparalleled.
