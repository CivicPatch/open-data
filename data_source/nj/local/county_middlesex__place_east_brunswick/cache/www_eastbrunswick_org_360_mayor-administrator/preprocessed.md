About the Mayor
---------------

Mayor Brad Cohen was elected to office in November of 2016. The mayor began his public career in 2010 when he was elected to the East Brunswick Board of Education. Working with his fellow Board members, he helped to navigate the schools through difficult economic times in the wake of the Great Recession and the draconian cuts in state aid. He was named Board President in 2014 and helped to select the new Superintendent of Schools. By 2016, the future mayor chose to use his skills to improve the quality of life for all the residents of East Brunswick

The campaign of 2016 focused on property taxes, the abandoned Route 18 commercial corridor, and quality of life issues in the township. Within a few months of taking office, the mayor recruited a professional team and established the Redevelopment Agency with the goal of addressing these needs. To date, redevelopment projects have been able to help stabilize municipal taxes as promised. Over the past five years the municipal portion of property taxes has increased an average 0.55% per year-well below the cost of living over the same period.

While it took time for the redevelopment team to plan its vision and strategy, we have seen the Edgeboro Road project result in a state-of-the-art FEDEX fulfillment center. Legacy Place on Tices Lane has replaced an abandoned and blighted industrial building. This new community features residential units mixed with retail and public space. Construction of the Municipal Ice Rinks are expected to break ground on this public space in the fall of 2024. This community is in stark contrast to the apartment complexes being built across the state. Vermella-East Brunswick-an Ed Russo project, is expected to break ground in the fall of 2024 and will feature a luxury mixed use community on the site that previously housed the Gap, the Wiz, and Loehmanns. Besides the marquis statement the buildings will make, it will feature a community with for-sale and rental residential units, public park space, and higher end retail with Route 18 frontage.

Over the past seven years we have seen a groundswell of community engagement. This has resulted in all our Boards and Commissions being filled with members of our diverse community. This has helped to fuel a record rise in recreation programs in the arts, athletics, and educational sectors. We have provided repairs and repaving of a record number of roads in the township’s 180 miles of highways. This year the township introduced a new solid waste and recycling contract that provided an increased level of service. This service combined with our convenient Recycling Center should all help to keep our community clean and adhere to higher sustainability goals.

The mayor is a 30-year resident of East Brunswick. He is a practicing gynecologist and is part of St. Peter’s Physician Associates with an office in East Brunswick and Somerset. He lives with his wife, Penny-herself a Dermatologist in Somerset. He has two children, Rachel and Daniel, who are both graduates of the East Brunswick Public School System (2006 and 2008).

As a graduate of Muhlenberg College, Allentown, PA, UMDNJ (now Rutgers) New Jersey Medical School and Rutgers Business School, the Mayor holds an MD and MBA degree. The mayor is an active member of Congregation B’nai Tikvah, North Brunswick and East Brunswick Jewish Center here in East Brunswick.
