Every year my administration and I take a fiscally conservative approach to developing our annual budget and this year was no exception. This year’s proposed budget represents the goals and priorities expressed during our budget planning sessions and align with our goals of continued high standard of residential services and operational items that our citizens have come to rely on. This is the core function of municipal government and despite the significant challenges we’ve faced, I am proud of the diligence and commitment of our municipal staff to assist Wayne Township residents and businesses through these trying times.

The development of the fiscal year 2023 budget was made more difficult due to levels of inflation not seen in this country in more than 40 years. Our Township continues to feel the impact of inflation and the ongoing supply chain crisis through spikes in material costs, increases in fuel prices and long delays for equipment purchases. These uncertainties were realized as we constructed the budget for the upcoming fiscal year. That being said, I am committed to continuing our investment in infrastructure, public safety and economic development.

As we are finally able to put COVID-19 behind us, I am proud to announce that our Township programs are up and running. Once again, the Township and the Wayne School System, are working collaboratively to present the “Wayne Community Forum”. This anti-drug initiative is specifically designed to provide parents and guardians of Middle and High School students with updated information about the most current drug trends in our community. I believe that effective communication and education can help Township residents to overcome this most challenging issue.

Additionally, our Parks and Recreation department continues to offer many exciting and entertaining programs for our residents including the community garden, tennis and pickle ball lessons, various trips throughout the year and our wonderful summer concert series. Likewise, the Township’s Health Department provides various services which insure the health and well-being of our residents. Programs such as the adult immunization clinics, the “Well Child Clinic” and the dental health clinic are just a sampling of what is available.

I am excited to announce that our economic development also continues to grow with the influx of several new businesses including BJ’s Wholesale Warehouse, Car Max, Tesla Automotive Company, Genesis of Wayne/Hyundai and FOGO DE CHAO CHURRASCARIA Steakhouse to name a few. I am pleased to say that Wayne Township continues to grow and thrive as a family friendly community that anyone would be proud to call their home!

Accordingly, my administrative priorities focus on the needs of our residents, working efficiently and economically for the good of the Township. I would not be able to achieve this goal without the diligence of the Township’s Municipal Council. Through our collaborative working relationship, we are able to ensure the best, possible services for our residents and I would be remiss if I did not express how extremely appreciative I am of this partnership. Additionally, I wish to thank the brave members of our Police Department, First Aid Squad and Fire Department for keeping our citizens safe and secure. Likewise, I extend my gratitude to all the members of Township Boards and Commissions, youth coaches and the dedicated employees of Wayne for their continued support and assistance in achieving these objectives. Wayne continues to prosper and our government continues to work because we all work together.

Lastly, I would like to thank you for allowing me to serve as your Mayor for the past 15 years. Please feel free to contact me at 973-694-1800, ext. 3200 or at
