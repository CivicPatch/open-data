![Hydrant Flushing Program Notice](https://www.edisonnj.org/Residential%20Water%20Repair%20Notice%206.11.25.jpg?t=202506111232030)

Beginning
**June 16, 2025,**
residents’ water will have a temporary decrease and/or total loss of pressure between the hours of
to allow the Township to perform its Hydrant Flushing Program for proper maintenance of our water distribution system and to test and evaluate the condition of the fire hydrants as well as remove any accumulated sediment. Hydrant Flushing will begin in the areas of Michelle Cir. and move south towards Meadow Rd.

Once water service is restored to full pressure, residents may experience discolored water. Running the cold-water tap will help clear up this condition. Residents are advised not to do laundry if the water is discolored. This work will take place weather permitting.

Discolored water is a common occurrence during annual hydrant flushing. Discolored water may also occur during water main breaks or any other occurrence where the watermain is disturbed.

With any questions, residents may contact the Edison Water Utility at (732) 248-6400 option 2.

[27 Dec 2024

New Jersey American Water continues to work closely with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJ DEP) to manage the impacts of a leak that occurred on Dec. 16, 2024, from a repackaging facility in Branchburg, N.J. into a tributary of the Raritan River. According to the NJ DEP, the material of the spill consisted of compounds, most notably alpha-pinene, which are commonly used as fragrance and food additives.
New Jersey American Water is continuing to collect sampling results, modify our treatment process and perform targeted hydrant flushing. As of Dec. 26, the company has observed no odor detections in the source water or in the water leaving its treatment plants. We are also continuing to coordinate with the New Jersey Water Supply Authority, which has been releasing additional source water into the river.
As the DEP continues to direct remediation efforts at the leak site and in anticipation of expected precipitation this weekend, New Jersey American Water will continue its monitoring, flushing and treatment efforts.
As a reminder, while the presence of alpha-pinene may still potentially be identified by its odor, the compound has not been detected using advanced analytical chemistry testing in the finished water leaving our treatment facilities or in the water distribution system. The water leaving New Jersey American Water’s two Raritan system treatment plants meets state and federal primary drinking water standards established by NJ DEP and US EPA, and no risk to public health has been identified by the NJ DEP.
We will keep working with the NJ DEP until this issue is resolved. We appreciate our customers’ continued patience, cooperation, and trust. As additional information becomes available, the company will provide updates at njamwaterwaterquality.com.
