**About Mayor Samip Joshi**

Born and raised in Edison, Mayor Samip Joshi began his tenure on January 1, 2022.  His second term began on January 1, 2026.

Since he became Mayor, Mayor Joshi focuses on stabilizing taxes, improving infrastructure, neighborhood preservation, and more. His administration prioritizes important initiatives that serve Edison youth, families, seniors, and businesses throughout the community.

Mayor Joshi takes pride in the transformation of all 32 municipal parks, the opening of the very first Splash Park, and the arrival of Comcast/Xfinity as a second internet provider in the municipality. Additionally, Mayor Joshi championed a statewide crime law to combat home invasion and burglaries. His administration also re-instated the Fix-It Program to assist Edison seniors and disabled people to help with home repairs.

Mayor Joshi’s commitment to infrastructure, public safety, community engagement and inclusivity aims to foster a thriving and diverse environment for residents of all ages and backgrounds in Edison.

Prior to becoming Mayor, he served on the Edison Township Council for four years, with two of them as Council Vice President. Mayor Joshi also served on the Fair Rental Housing Authority for over four years appointed by Mayor Antonia Ricigliano (served 2010-2013), the Edison Zoning Board for two years, and also worked as a 9-1-1 telecommunicator for the Edison Police Department.

Mayor Joshi’s roots in government go back to his first internship in Edison Township at the age of 14, under Mayor George A. Spadoro (served 1994-2005), and later Mayor Jun Choi (served 2006-2009).
