![ North Bergen Secures NJDOT Action to Improve Traffic Conditions at 91st Street & Tonnelle Avenue ](https://www.northbergen.org/_Content/img/news/traffic-light.jpg)


The Township of North Bergen announced today that the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) has agreed to adjust traffic signal timing at the intersection of Tonnelle Avenue (Routes 1 & 9) and 91st Street following formal action by Mayor Nicholas Sacco and the Board of Commissioners and coordination with state officials.

“Public safety and quality of life are always our top priorities,” said Mayor Sacco. “This intersection had become a serious problem for residents and for our first responders. I am pleased that NJDOT has listened to our concerns and is taking steps to correct the signal timing so traffic can move safely and efficiently again.”

At the most recent January 7th Board of Commissioners Meeting, Mayor Sacco and the Board adopted a resolution requesting that NJDOT reevaluate traffic patterns at the heavily traveled intersection, citing severe congestion and public safety concerns. Vehicles were experiencing delays of more than 45 minutes to travel just a few city blocks, preventing residents from leaving or returning to their homes and creating obstacles for emergency responders.

Following the meeting, Public Safety Commissioner Allen Pascual, Police Chief Robert Farley and EMS Chief David Prina met with NJDOT engineers to review conditions at the intersection. State engineers agreed to recalibrate the signal timing to provide additional green time for westbound downhill traffic, a change expected to significantly reduce rush-hour congestion.

“Tonnelle Avenue is controlled by the New Jersey Department of Transportation, and after months of communication we are pleased that action is finally being taken,” said Commissioner Pascual. “We remain committed to improving quality of life in North Bergen and thank our residents for bringing these concerns to our attention.”

The Township will continue to monitor conditions at the intersection and will keep residents informed as adjustments are implemented and evaluated.

![FY 2025-2029 Five-Year Consolidated Plan & FY 2025 Annual Action Plan for CDBG Program](https://www.northbergen.org/_Content/img/news/public-notice.jpg)


The Township of North Bergen is considered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as an Entitlement Community. Entitlement Communities are comprised of central cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs); metropolitan cities with populations of at least 50,000; and qualified urban counties with a population of 200,000 or more (excluding the populations of entitlement cities). As an Entitlement Community, North Bergen receives an annual Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) allocation from HUD, based on a formula comprising of several measures of community  
need, including the extent of poverty, population, housing overcrowding, age of housing, and population growth lag in relationship to other metropolitan areas.

In accordance, the Township of North Bergen, NJ has prepared an updated FY 2025-2029 Five-Year Consolidated Plan and FY 2025 Annual Action Plan. The 2025-2029 Consolidated Plan covers the upcoming five-year period, from July 1, 2025 – June 30, 2030. The 2025 Annual Action Plan covers the first year of this five-year period, from July 1, 2025 to June 30, 2026. For the 2025 Annual Action Plan, the Township has been allocated $741,207 in CDBG funding.

The Consolidated Plan is carried out through Annual Action Plans, which provide a summary of the actions, activities, and resources that will be used each year to address the priority needs and specific goals identified by the Consolidated Plan. The Consolidated Plan is intended to serve the following functions: 1) A planning document for the Township, which builds upon a citizen participation process; 2) An application for federal funds under HUD's formula grant programs; 3) A strategy to be followed in carrying out HUD programs; and, 4) An action plan that provides a basis for assessing performance.

CDBG funds are intended to support community development activities to build stronger and more resilient communities. The overall goal is to develop viable urban communities for low- and moderateincome persons, through decent housing, a suitable living environment and expanded economic opportunities. CDBG-funded activities may address needs such as infrastructure, economic development projects, public facilities installation, community centers, housing rehabilitation, public services,  
clearance/acquisition, microenterprise assistance, code enforcement, homeowner assistance, etc.
