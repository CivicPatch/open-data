### Mayor Nicholas J. Sacco

  

NICHOLAS SACCO has dedicated his life to serving the public and bettering his community. From his earliest days as a teacher, throughout his career as an educator and school administrator, and in elected office, he has been driven by one guiding principle: working hard to improve the lives of his neighbors and give back to his community.

Elected mayor of North Bergen in 1991 following six years as a commissioner, Mayor Sacco has turned North Bergen around during his tenure. His administration has worked to keep the community affordable for both homeowners and renters with stable property taxes and the state's strongest rent control law.

Under Mayor Sacco’s leadership, North Bergen’s municipal services have become a model for neighboring communities. In winter, the Department of Public Works makes sure the township’s steep hills are safe and drivable regardless of weather conditions. The Recreation Department provides the township’s children with a vast array of sports and activities on state-of-the-art fields and playing areas. North Bergen’s Police Department provides an outstanding level of service and proactively works to prevent crime.

Mayor Sacco helped create the North Hudson Regional Fire & Rescue, and also serves North Bergen in the New Jersey State Senate, where he was elected in 1993. As senator, he has continued to benefit the township by creating the Urban Enterprise Zone program that helped revitalize North Bergen and turn it into a shopping destination.

A graduate of Rutgers University, Mayor Sacco earned his master’s degree from Seton Hall University.
