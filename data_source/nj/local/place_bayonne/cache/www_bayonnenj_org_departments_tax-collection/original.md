[Bayonne Third Quarter Property Taxes Due by Grace Date of Thursday, August 10](https://www.bayonnenj.org/News/View/11592/bayonne-third-quarter-property-taxes-due-by-grace-date-of-thursday-august-10)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted Tuesday, August 1, 2023

![](https://www.bayonnenj.org/_Content/img/news/taxbill.jpg)


The Bayonne Tax Collector’s Office announced that third quarter property tax payments are due on **Thursday, August 10**. The nominal legal due date for the tax bills was Tuesday, August 1.  The City Council authorized a grace period through the close of business on Thursday, August 10.  Payments made by that date will avoid a late fee.  Property owners may pay their taxes by mail or in person at City Hall, 630 Avenue C, or at Bayonne branches of BCB Bank, or online through the City of Bayonne website, [www.bayonnenj.org](http://www.bayonnenj.org).

By state law, quarterly payments received after the close of business on Thursday, August 10, will incur interest charges dating back to Tuesday, August 1, the nominal, legal due date for the third quarter.  For anyone making payment in person on August 10, the Tax Collector’s Office strongly recommends paying in person at City Hall before the close of business that day at 4:30 p.m.  You can pay at the Tax Collector’s Office.

Those who handle their property taxes through their monthly mortgage payments should have received advice copies of the property tax bills in the third quarter tax mailing.  They should continue paying their property taxes through their mortgages.

The third quarter tax bill is an estimated one, because Hudson County did not set a 2023 tax rate before the bills were mailed.  This estimated bill has the same status as a regular tax bill and may be paid without interest through Thursday, August 10, the date specified as the end of the grace period.

A final, reconciled tax bill for the year will be issued to taxpayers prior to Wednesday, November 1, 2023.

At its meeting on February 17, the Bayonne City Council approved Mayor Jimmy Davis’s nomination of Rosemarie Martinez to serve as Tax Collector for the City of Bayonne.  She will assume the office effective March 1, 2021 for an initial period through December 31, 2021, and then for a four-year term effective January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2025.  Ms. Martinez will replace Interim Tax Collector Kenneth Bosotina.  The last permanent Tax Collector was Joanne Sisk, who served from 2002 until her retirement in 2019.  Ms. Martinez has worked in the Tax Collector’s Office since July 2019 with the title of Assistant Tax Collector.  As she prepared to assume the title of Tax Collector, Ms. Martinez said, “I am grateful to Mayor Davis and the City Council for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” Mayor Davis said, “The City of Bayonne is happy to have a Tax Collector who is already a highly experienced professional in government service.  From her years in county and municipal government, Rose is very familiar with economic development, municipal finance, and the other issues that we face. We wish Rose the best as she begins this new period of service to the people of Bayonne.”
