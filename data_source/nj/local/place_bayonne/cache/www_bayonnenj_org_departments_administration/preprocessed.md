[Mayor's Statement on Covid-19 Testing](https://www.bayonnenj.org/News/View/10053/mayor-s-statement-on-covid-19-testing)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello, this is Mayor Davis.  Across the nation, COVID-19 testing labs are having problems providing PCR test results in a timely fashion. In Bayonne, we have people who tested just prior to and just after Christmas who have still not received their PCR test results.   THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. Every lab in this area is currently faced with staffing issues and they simply cannot process the tests that continue to be sent to them daily.

As of right now and for the foreseeable future, PCR testing is not a viable option.  We need to pivot immediately and take a different approach to testing so that our citizens can be properly prepared, informed, and protected.  To that end, the City of Bayonne is no longer going to offer PCR testing.  Instead, we are going to move to Rapid Testing.  We are canceling PCR testing at the Korpi Ice Rink effective immediately. THERE WILL BE NO TESTING OF ANY KIND AT THE KORPI ICE RINK ON WEDNESDAY THE 5TH.   We will offer Rapid Testing at the Korpi Ice Rink on Thursday the 6th, Friday the 7th and Saturday the 8th from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm.

We have a limited number of rapid tests available, however, so we are forced to limit the number of tests we can offer to 500 per day. Additionally, much like we did when we first started testing and vaccines, all rapid testing will be done by appointment only and we ask that you only schedule a test if you are symptomatic or if you know you have had a direct exposure to someone who has a confirmed COVID-19 test result.  You can schedule your appointment by calling 201-537-4818.

I want to thank you all for your cooperation and understanding throughout this health emergency.  Be well and I will provide you with more information about additional testing in the very near future.

Located at 424 Avenue C in Bayonne, the Mi Lindo Mexico Restaurant is owned and operated by Jose Manuel and Minerva Castro.  They wanted to bring the authentic Mexican food that they grew up with to Bayonne. They offer pickup and delivery service. Mayor Jimmy Davis, First Ward Council Member Neil Carroll, Council Member At-Large Juan Perez, and Second Ward Council Member Sal Gullace were present to celebrate the grand opening.

Hello, this is Mayor Davis. As we have been speaking about over the last week, Bayonne is now vaccinating people who are in Phase 1A.  This process started yesterday and we are vaccinating well over 100 people a day at the Bayonne Medical Center as we work to get to the thousands of seniors over 65 and anyone who has a serious medical condition.  As you can imagine, scheduling this many people is a very challenging task, however, our teams are up to the challenge and the vaccination process is going very smoothly.  I do need to ask you all for a few things.  First, please be patient.  There are thousands of people who need to be scheduled and YOU WILL hear from us, so please be patient and await our scheduler to call you.  Also, DO NOT call the Hospital or city hall.  The only number to call to be scheduled is 201-858-6088 or you can email us at
[**bayvax@baynj.org**](mailto:bayvax@baynj.org)
, but you only need to contact us once.  Do not continue to leave messages or send numerous emails.  Do Not show up at the hospital without an appointment, as you will be sent home.  If you do not want to wait for a call to be vaccinated at Bayonne Medical Center you can go to the County site in Kearny.  You can register for that site by visiting hudsoncovidvax.org.  Keep in mind that wherever you get your first shot, you must go to the same location for the second shot.

Bayonne is a large city, and we have great and cooperative people.  Please work with me on this and BE PATIENT.  We will call you and you will be vaccinated, just be patient.  Thank you all so very much for your understanding and cooperation.  We will talk again soon.
