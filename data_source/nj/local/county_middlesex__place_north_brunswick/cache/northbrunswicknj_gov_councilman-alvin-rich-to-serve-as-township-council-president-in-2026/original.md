Councilman Alvin Rich to serve as Township Council President in 2026
====================================================================

January 6, 2026  
  

Councilman Alvin Rich was sworn in as Township Council President at the January 5 Council Reorganization Meeting.

“As we begin this new year, I am truly honored to step into the role of Council President,” he said. “I admit that I feel a mix of nerves and excitement tonight because I understand the responsibility that comes with this position. It’s a responsibility I embrace with gratitude, humility and a deep commitment to serve in this community.”

Council President Rich said the “role is not about the title” but service.

“It is about collaboration, trust and making thoughtful decisions that strengthen our community today and in future generations,” he said. “I am ready to get to work.”

Council President Rich and Councilwoman Amanda Guadagnino were sworn in to their respective terms by Mayor Francis ‘Mac’ Womack.

“I am incredibly grateful to the residents of North Brunswick for the trust and confidence that you have placed in me once again,” Councilwoman Guadagnino said. “It is an honor to continue serving this community that we all love so much. I take that responsibility very seriously every single day.”

The reorganization meeting was meaningful for Councilwoman Guadagnino as it marked the beginning of her 10th year on the Township Council.

“Over the past nine years, I have seen North Brunswick adapt, face challenges and grow stronger,” she said. “I have learned the values of steady leadership, clear priorities, transparency and thoughtful decision making.”

Also sworn in at the reorganization meeting were Township Attorney Ronald Gordon and Fire Chief Leo Whalen, First Assistant Chief Rich Rivelli and Second Assistant Chief Stephen Chaszar.
