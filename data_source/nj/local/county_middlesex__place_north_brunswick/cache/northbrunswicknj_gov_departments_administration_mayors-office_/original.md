**\*\*\*MESSAGE FROM MAYOR WOMACK REGARDING THE NORTH BRUNSWICK FOOD BANK\*\*\***

North Brunswick residents join Americans across our nation in experiencing heavy impacts of the ongoing government shutdown. Many of our neighbors are facing sudden financial strain as paychecks are delayed, federal programs are paused, and assistance systems are stretched thin. Food insecurity is growing rapidly among families who have never before needed help.

I am reaching out to ask for your partnership and compassion during this difficult time. Your kindness and humanity can make a profound difference for families in need.
