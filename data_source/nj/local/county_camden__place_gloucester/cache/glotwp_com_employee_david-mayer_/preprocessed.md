Since taking office in 2010, David Mayer has been re-elected in 2013, 2017, and 2021. David has worked on improving the Township’s finances and stabilizing taxes. He introduced eight budgets which each held the line on the municipal tax rate. He has also implemented many sustainable and green initiatives including solar installations like Timber Creek Solar Park and over 20 acres of solar panels on the old Municipal Landfill with all projects yielding 17,264,651 kWh annually.

He created new community policing programs and significantly enhanced policing capabilities and public safety that have resulted in year-after-year crime reduction.
David has worked hard to promote economic development and job creation in Gloucester Township, opening one of the largest economic development projects in the South Jersey region, the Gloucester Premium Outlets, that alone created over 400 construction jobs and 600 permanent positions.

David began his public career in 1989 as an aide for Robert E. Andrews, who was Freeholder Director then. He continued working in Andrews’ successful congressional campaign and became Director of the Congressman’s district office. From 1995 to 2004, David served as Chief of Staff to Camden County Clerk, James Beach.

David’s service as an elected official began in May of 2002 when he was elected to the Gloucester Township Council. It was David’s strong opposition to dual office holding that made him resign from the council position and enter the race for State Assembly in the Fourth District in 2003.

David was elected to the State Assembly both in 2003 and 2005, where he served on the Assembly Transportation and Education Committees and sponsored many pieces of legislation including the New Jersey Stars Program.

David earned a B.A. in Psychology from Rutgers-Camden, a Masters Degree in Public Policy and Administration, Rutgers-Camden, and a Law Degree from Rutgers School of Law-Camden. He has been teaching courses in political science, public administration and public policy at Camden County College, Rutgers-Camden and Rowan Universities.

David currently serves as Director of Government Affairs for New Jersey American Water. He also serves on the Board of Trustees for the Chamber of Commerce of Southern New Jersey and is Chairman of the Rowan University/ Rutgers Camden Board of Governors.
David and his wife, Michelle, the Surrogate of Camden County, have five children and live in the Sicklerville section of Gloucester Township.
