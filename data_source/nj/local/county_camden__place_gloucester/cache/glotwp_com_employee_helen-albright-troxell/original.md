Helen Albright Troxell has made Gloucester Township her home since 1976, both in the Blenheim section and now in Laurel Springs. She has raised her son in Gloucester Township and was an enthusiastic soccer mom.

Helen has an A.A.S degree and a certificate in Management from Camden County College. She also holds a B.S. in Administration from Widener University along with a Certificate from Rutgers New Brunswick Labor Education Center in Leadership. Helen is a graduate from the State of New Jersey Government Internship Program at Rutgers, New Brunswick, and serves as secretary of the class.

She is retired after 30 years of service from Camden County College and has been a Board of Trustee Member for 14 years. She has been active at Chews United Methodist Church over the past 45 years and is also a member of the Kiwanis Club. She supports Mainstage and is especially grateful for our Fire and Police Departments.
