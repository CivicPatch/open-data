Posted on [July 30, 2025](https://glotwp.com/employee/ciri-castro/ "Ciri Castro Jr.") by [![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6cc2d473aa7461f919aff0381803e6d133105808c15df0c34947e51c8b3e435a?s=32&d=mm&r=g)webdevral](https://glotwp.com/author/webdevral/ "View all posts by webdevral")

Ciri Castro Jr., born in Camden, New Jersey, is a proud son of Puerto Rican heritage and the eldest of three siblings. Strong family values are the core foundation he and his wife Beatriz have instilled in their children. Inspired during high school, he enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve in 1992, transitioning to active duty where he served in Germany and Georgia, gaining invaluable experience.  
After his five years of military service, he returned home to coach youth sports and joined the Camden City Fire Department in 2004. Rising through the ranks, he became a union State Delegate, advocating for firefighter safety and wellness, and was elected in 2020 as President of Camden City Firefighters Local 788.  
His commitment to service continued with his previous role as a Peer Support Coordinator for the Professional Firefighter’s Association of New Jersey and his promotion to Fire Marshal in 2021, where he leads fire prevention efforts and community engagement. Throughout his journey, Ciri’s unwavering dedication to his community, service and family has defined a life of purpose and impact.
