Michael Mignone has been a resident of Gloucester Township since 2000. An avid fan of baseball and community involvement, he is a firm believer in getting off the sidelines and on the field to make a difference. He is committed to Gloucester Township and is passionate about continuing its growth. Mr. Mignone received an Associate’s Degree in Radiology from Hahnemann University and is currently the Radiology Administrative Director at Lower Bucks Hospital in Bristol, PA. He is married to his wife Tara, and together they have two children, Luke and Isabella. Mr. Mignone’s personal time is spent residing as the Vice president of Erial Little League, where he also coaches. One of Mr. Mignone’s shining moments as a coach was when his all-star team won a New Jersey State Championship in 2013! Mr. Mignone enjoys every moment on the ball fields with his children Luke and Isabella, where he gets the opportunity to teach the game of baseball and softball, sportsmanship and motivate the children of the Erial section in Gloucester Township. Mr. Mignone can also be found lecturing Scripture at St. Charles Borromeo church.
