— New Jersey State Assembly Majority Whip Carol Murphy (D- Mount Laurel) this evening administered the oath of office to Mount Laurel Mayor Nikitas Moustakas.  2025 will mark a historic year for Mount Laurel Township, as for the first time Township Council will be represented by black, Hispanic, and South Asian descent.

“I’m proud of the tremendous leadership in our township from Mayor Fozia Janjua and Deputy Mayor Nikitas Moustakas, and have the utmost confidence in Deputy Mayor Moustakas stepping forward in his new role as Mayor,” said State Assembly Majority Whip Carol Murphy. “Deputy Mayor Moustakas, throughout his time on Council, has proved to be a champion for small businesses and continues to lead with a community-first approach. Mount Laurel Township continues to be the best place to live, work, and raise a family and I look forward to working with Mayor Moustakas and Deputy Mayor Steglik in 2025.”

In 2023, under the leadership of Mayor Fozia Janjua, the Township continued to provide new exciting events for residents, including the Township’s first Fourth of July and fireworks celebration. This event brought together 15,000 residents and community members to celebrate our nation’s history. The Township continues to provide a high quality of life, and was honored with the #6 spot on the hottest zip codes in America by Realtor.com.

Mayor Nikitas Moustakas said, “It is a great privilege to serve as your Mayor for 2025. I am so proud of the progress Township Council has made over the past four years, and we will continue to push forward policies that improve infrastructure, help our local economy and businesses thrive, and bring leadership that is transparent, thoughtful, and community driven. Working together with Deputy Mayor Stephen Steglik and Township Council members, we will continue to provide leadership that works for everyone, grow our town’s economy, and bring events together to celebrate everyone.”

Senator Troy Singleton administered the oath of office to Deputy Mayor Stephen Steglik. Deputy Mayor Steglik commented on the success of 2024, “I am proud to continue to be part of a Township Council that empowers our businesses, creates events for our residents and brings our community together to celebrate, and continues to maintain a high quality level of services.”

In 2021, a number of record successes took place. Under Stephen Steglik’s term as Mayor, the Township saw the formation of a new Environmental Commission Board and the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Board. Both these boards have provided guidance in a number of different Township programs, including the Diversity Board’s involvement with Juneteenth, one of the Township’s biggest events. Despite 2021 being a time right out of the pandemic, the Township saw a number of new businesses open and new events including the Township’s annual Food Truck Festival.  Township Council has continued to deliver on its commitment to its community by maintaining high quality level of services, new exciting events for residents, a growing business community, and being the best town to raise a family with a number of different parks and recreation areas.

Senator Nilsa Cruz Perez administered the oath of office to newcomer Silvia Catalan-Culnan, who joins Township Council as the first Latina Councilwoman. Silvia brings a fresh perspective and has a rich background of working to solve problems for residents by connecting them with state and county government services. “I am honored to join Township Council and help build on the progress that council has made over the last four years. Mount Laurel is a town rich with diversity, history, and continues to be a place I am proud to raise my family.”

Mayor Nikitas Moustakas, Deputy Mayor Stephen Steglik, Councilwoman Silvia Catalan-Culnan, and Township Council will continue to work for the Mount Laurel community and build on the progress created.
