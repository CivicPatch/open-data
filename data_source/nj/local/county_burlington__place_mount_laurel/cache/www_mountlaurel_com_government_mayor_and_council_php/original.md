Fozia Janjua is a civic leader, educator, and nonprofit founder who made history in 2024 as the first Muslim and South Asian woman to serve as Mayor of Mount Laurel Township. A first-generation Pakistani American, she was born and raised in San Francisco, CA by immigrant parents who instilled in her a deep respect for education, service, and community responsibility, values that continue to shape her public and personal life.

 

An educator at heart, Fozia has years of experience teaching and developing curriculum, most recently as a first-grade teacher in a Quaker school. While currently taking a pause from the classroom, she continues to teach Sunday school, mentoring students in faith, character, and community values.

 

Fozia’s lifelong commitment to volunteerism led her to co-found Community SJP, a nonprofit dedicated to bringing people together in service. Through initiatives that provide meals to families in need, school supplies to students, blankets and hygiene kits to hospitals and shelters. 

 

A proud mother of four boys, Fozia brings both the perspective of a parent and the experience of a public servant to her work.
