           Fozia Janjua is a civic leader, educator, and nonprofit founder who made history in 2024 as the first Muslim and South Asian woman to serve as Mayor of Mount Laurel Township. A first-generation Pakistani American, she was born and raised in San Francisco, CA by immigrant parents who instilled in her a deep respect for education, service, and community responsibility, values that continue to shape her public and personal life.

          <span style="font-family: Montserrat;">
           An educator at heart, Fozia has years of experience teaching and developing curriculum, most recently as a first-grade teacher in a Quaker school. While currently taking a pause from the classroom, she continues to teach Sunday school, mentoring students in faith, character, and community values.
          </span>
         </p>
         Fozia’s lifelong commitment to volunteerism led her to co-found Community SJP, a nonprofit dedicated to bringing people together in service. Through initiatives that provide meals to families in need, school supplies to students, blankets and hygiene kits to hospitals and shelters.
         A proud mother of four boys, Fozia brings both the perspective of a parent and the experience of a public servant to her work.
