During the next year, I will work to ensure our growing township pushes forward smart policies to help our local economy, ensure our residents feel safe and fight for critical infrastructure improvements we need to improve our roads, water quality and improve our quality of life. And, most importantly, we will continue to build upon a responsive, open and transparent government that will work hard for all residents.”

Deputy Mayor Steglik stated “The challenges we faced were unprecedented during the past year and I could not be prouder of my colleagues, as we worked together to ensure that Mount Laurel would see the progress we promised on reorganization day nearly a year ago. It was not always easy as we faced complex issues that we knew needed to be addressed to improve our township and when faced with even more difficult issues last summer we brought the community together to usher in a new day of progress in Mount Laurel.”
