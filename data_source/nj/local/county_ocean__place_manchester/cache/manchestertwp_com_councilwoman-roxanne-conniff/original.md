Councilwoman Roxanne Conniff[ManchesterTWP](https://manchestertwp.com/author/adminmt/ "Posts by ManchesterTWP")2023-01-03T14:33:53-05:00

Mrs. Roxanne Conniff won her seat on the Manchester Township Council in the December 2022 runoff election and assumed office on January 3, 2023. Her term will expire on December 31, 2027.

Roxanne “Roxy” Conniff is a life-long resident of Manchester, growing up in Pine Lake Park with her parents and older sister, and settling in Whiting with her husband, Sean, also a life-long resident. She is an experienced leader who has spent her career working on behalf of local communities just like Manchester.

She is a proud Manchester Hawk who graduated from The College of New Jersey with a Bachelor’s in Political Science and has been a dedicated public servant, working to help residents across New Jersey through constituent relations, solve local problems with elected officials, and assist in the development of state policies throughout her time working in the Governor’s New Jersey. Roxanne plans to use her experience to maximize the benefits that Manchester receives from the state and reduce property taxes. Currently, Roxy works in business development for a mid-size technology firm.
