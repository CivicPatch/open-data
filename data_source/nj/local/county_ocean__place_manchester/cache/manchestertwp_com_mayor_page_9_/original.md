Mayor of Manchester Township, New Jersey[ManchesterTWP](https://manchestertwp.com/author/adminmt/ "Posts by ManchesterTWP")2025-01-14T09:57:29-05:00

Meet Mayor Joseph Hankins
-------------------------

[![](https://manchestertwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_2072-1-1024x908.jpg)](https://manchestertwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_2072-1.jpg)

The Manchester Township Council on January 13, 2025, accepted nominations for Mayor and voted to appoint Councilman Joseph Hankins to the leadership role, following the resignation of former Mayor Robert Arace.

Mr. Joseph Hankins initially won his seat on the Manchester Township Council in the December 2022 runoff election and assumed office on January 3, 2023. His term will expire on December 31, 2026.

Joe is a life-long resident of Manchester, raising his family with his wife, Carol Ann here in Pine Lake Park. As a dedicated public servant, Joe has served 25 years as a Manchester Police Officer, keeping our town safe and protecting our community. Their son followed in his footsteps, becoming a Manchester police officer and starting his own family in Manchester.

As a Manchester Police Officer, Joe served our town as a Patrolman, Detective, and Patrol Sergeant. He also served as Fire Chief, Emergency Medical Technician, and SCUBA Captain and is currently the Vice President of the New Jersey State Fireman’s Association. Joe holds a Master’s degree from Fairleigh Dickinson University in Public Administration. Having an ancestor who fought in the American Revolutionary War and resided in near-by Jackson Township, Joe is also an active member of the Sons of the American Revolution.

A special election to serve the remainder of the Mayoral term, which expires on December 31, 2026, will be held in November of 2025.

With your support, Mayor Hankins looks forward to preserving the quality of life for all Manchester residents and continuing to make our town a great place to live for both retirees and new families, alike.
