Michele Zolezi was appointed and sworn in on July 26, 2021, to assume the Manchester Township Council vacancy created when Robert Hudak resigned his seat to accept his appointment as Mayor on June 28, 2021.

Ms. Zolezi is a life-long resident of Manchester Township who has served on the Township Planning Board for nearly a decade, leading it as Board Chair since 2017. She called her experience on the Planning Board and various municipal bodies, including the Open Space Committee and Master Plan Committee, “extremely fulfilling and rewarding.” These roles have prepared Ms. Zolezi for her next endeavor, joining the Township Council.

“Continuing my public service in the role of a Township Council Member would be the perfect forum to utilize my experience, knowledge, and talents for the betterment of our community,” she said. “I’m very honored and humbled to be here.”

Professionally, Ms. Zolezi is an Environmental Division Manager and Corporate Environmental Affairs Executive, currently employed by Earle, with over 25 years of environmental consulting, material management and regulatory compliance experience. She has comprehensive experience in local, state and federal regulatory compliance in a host of issues related to environmental issues surrounding real estate. She holds a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Sciences from Stockton University, and attended NJIT for postgraduate studies.

Having watched Manchester Township grow, develop and diversify, Ms. Zolezi knows the “wonderful place” that her hometown is. “There is no better place to raise a family,” she said. “With my two children, we have been involved in Pop Warner Football and Cheerleading, school academics and sports, clubs, Veterans Day ceremonies, holiday tree lighting and a host of wonderful events over the years.”

The Township Council solicited resumes for the appointment of a new member to fill the remainder of Mr. Hudak’s un-expired term, which ends on December 31, 2024. Following an extensive review of candidates, Ms. Zolezi was appointed to the position until December 31, 2021. She will be required to run in the November 2, 2021, general election should she wish to fulfill the remainder of the unexpired term.
