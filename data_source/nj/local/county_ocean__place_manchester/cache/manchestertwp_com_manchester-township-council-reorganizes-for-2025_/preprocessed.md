The Manchester Township Council on January 2, 2025, voted to retain Roxanne Conniff as its President, and James A. Vaccaro Sr. as Vice President for the new year during the governing body’s Reorganization Meeting held in the Municipal Complex Courtroom.

Prior to the public meeting, Councilmembers Craig Wallis, Michele Zolezi, and Vice President Vaccaro, took their Oaths of Office, all having won re-election during the November 2024 general election.

Mayor Rob Arace, who previously announced that he will resign his position following his election to the Ocean County Board of Commissioners, addressed those in attendance, thanking Manchester’s residents for the opportunity to serve them.

“We’ve done really amazing work. In the last two years, I’d like to say we’ve done more work in town than we’ve done in many years prior,” he said. “This is not goodbye, but rather a continuation of our shared mission to create a brighter future for Ocean County. Thank you so much.”

The Township Council will select a new mayor from its members to serve Mr. Arace’s term, which has two remaining years, through the end of 2025. An election for the remaining one year of the term then will be held this upcoming November.

The selection of mayor is anticipated to take place at the January 13, 2025, regular Township Council meeting. The Council will then consider qualified candidates to fill the unexpired term of the councilmember who vacates their seat to serve as mayor.

The current composition of the Township Council for 2025 is: President Roxanne Conniff, Vice President James A. Vaccaro Sr., Councilwoman Michele Zolezi, Councilman Joseph Hankins, and Councilman Craig Wallis.

In addition to township employees and department heads, special guests at the meeting included State Senators Brian E. Rumpf and Carmen Amato, who presented Mayor Arace with a proclamation in recognition of his service to the residents of Manchester Township.

Other items at the Reorganization Meeting included the appointment of Manchester Township’s professional services and establishment of meeting dates for 2025.
