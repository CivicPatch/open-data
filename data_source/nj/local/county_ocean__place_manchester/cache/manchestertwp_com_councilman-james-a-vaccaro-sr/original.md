Councilman James A. Vaccaro, Sr., was first elected to the Township Council in 2012, where he has served as both the Council President and Vice President. In addition to his service on the Township Council, Councilman Vaccaro continues to serve as a Manchester Township Planning Board member.

Councilman Vaccaro is also Manchester Township’s alternate designee to the Pinelands Municipal Council, a position he has held for the past seven years.

Council Member James A. Vaccaro, Sr., takes his Oath of Office.

Councilman Vaccaro has lived in the Renaissance section of Manchester Township for more than 16 years with his wife of 33 years, Karen. They have four children and eight grandchildren. Having earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Economics (Accounting Major, Cum Laude honor) from Villanova University, Councilman Vaccaro was employed as a Manager for the United States Treasury Department-Internal Revenue Service for 36 years. He also works as a self-employed Forensic Tax Accountant and is an Enrolled Agent for the Internal Revenue Service.

As a member of the governing body, Councilman Vaccaro has been a proponent of exploring revenue-enhancing projects, increasing the Township’s tax ratables, implementing a [No Knock Registry](http://www.manchestertwp.com/no-knock-registry/), creating the [Shop Manchester](http://www.manchestertwp.com/departments/department-of-administration/purchasing/shop-manchester/) property tax reward program, and bringing a registry for abandoned and vacant properties to fruition.

Councilman Vaccaro’s record of distinguished public service predates his time in Manchester Township. He proudly served as a member of the Long Branch Fire Department for 36 years, was an elected member of the Long Branch Board of Education for 11 years (Board President for three years and Vice President for two years), and served on the Board of Governors for Jersey Shore Medical Center.

Councilman Vaccaro is the current President of the Renaissance Italian-American Club, and the former Finance Chairman of the Renaissance Homeowners Association. Among his honors, Councilman Vaccaro was awarded the U.S. Congressional and N.J. Senate Recognition for Distinguished Community Service.

In 2016, Councilman Vaccaro was re-elected to the Township Council for his second term, which expires on December 31st, 2020.
