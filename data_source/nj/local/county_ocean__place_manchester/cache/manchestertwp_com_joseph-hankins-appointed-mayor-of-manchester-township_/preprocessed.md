Joseph Hankins Appointed Mayor of Manchester Township
-----------------------------------------------------

The Manchester Township Council on January 13, 2025, accepted nominations for Mayor and voted to appoint Councilman Joseph Hankins to the leadership role, following the resignation of Robert Arace.

Mayor Hankins then took his Oath of Office before family, friends, Township employees, and honored guests inside the Municipal Complex Courtroom.
“I’d like to thank everyone who supported me, from the Council, to the staff and department heads,” said Mayor Hankins, adding that he is eager to continue working for the residents of Manchester Township. “It’s very important that we move forward.”

Mayor Hankins is a lifelong Township resident who served 25 years as a Manchester Township Police Officer, retiring as a Sergeant. He also serves as the Vice President of the New Jersey State Fireman’s Association and holds a Master’s degree from Fairleigh Dickinson University.

Mayor Hankins was elected to the governing body in the December 2022 runoff election, and began his four-year term as Councilman in January of 2023. A special election to serve the remainder of the Mayoral term, which expires on December 31, 2026, will be held in November of 2025.

Mayor Hankins received the votes of Council President Roxanne Conniff, Council Vice President James A. Vaccaro Sr., Councilwoman Michele Zolezi, and himself. Councilman Craig Wallis was absent and thus did not cast a vote.

The Council is now accepting resumes through January 21, 2025, for those residents interested in assuming the Council seat previously held by Mayor Hankins. Resumes may be emailed to clerk@manchestertwp.com or dropped off at the Office of the Municipal Clerk located in town hall. Anyone with questions regarding the process may call 732-657-8121, ext. 3200.
A special election to fill the remainder of Mr. Hankins’ Council term, which expires on December 31, 2026, will be held in November of 2025.

On January 2, 2025, Ms. Conniff was selected as the Council’s President, and James Vaccaro as Vice President for the new year during the governing body’s Reorganization Meeting.
