Mayor &  City Council
---------------------

The City operates under the New Jersey Municipal Manager Law of 1923. This form of government separates policy making (the work of the Mayor and City Council) from the execution of policy (the work of the City Manager). This maintains professional management and a City-wide perspective through: nonpartisan election, at large representation, concentration of executive responsibility in the hands of a professional manager accountable to the Mayor and Council, concentration of policy making power in one body – a five-person Mayor and Council.​
