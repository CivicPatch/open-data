The City of Hackensack officially welcomed its newly elected Mayor and City Council at the July 1st Re-Organization Meeting, following a record-setting election that achieved the highest voter turnout in fifty years—as well as the largest electoral margin of victory and most diverse leadership team elected in the City’s history.

Among the night’s highlights, former Mayor Marlin Townes Jr., who served as the City’s first Black Mayor in 2005, administered the oath of office to Mayor Caseen Gaines. A lifelong Hackensack resident, Gaines is recognized for nearly two decades of service as a public-school educator, as well as for his roles as an author, labor union leader, and co-founder of the City’s resident theater company. He has long been a driving force for arts, education, and community engagement in Hackensack.

Agatha Toomey, an Italian immigrant who has called Hackensack home for nearly six decades, whose commitment spans almost forty years in leadership with the City’s Human Services Department, was sworn in as Deputy Mayor. Toomey, a small business owner and tireless advocate for social services, has shaped policy and improved the quality of life for countless Hackensack families while also leading regional associations and service organizations.

The Hackensack Unites team also includes Roberto Diaz, who made history as the City’s first Dominican American Councilman. A leader in higher education administration, Diaz focuses on building organizational efficiency and connecting Hackensack’s diverse neighborhoods. Councilmember Philip Carroll, a Hackensack resident for nearly fifty years, brings decades of experience in law enforcement, community policing, and local education. Rounding out the team, Sonya Clark-Collins, a lifelong Hackensack resident, is recognized for her IT and administrative expertise, along with her passionate advocacy for affordable housing and tenant rights.

The July 1st ceremony, billed as “a celebration of Hackensack’s future,” drew nearly five hundred people who represented a true cross-section of the City: residents, family, business leaders, local dignitaries and former Mayors, as well as elected leaders from Garfield, Englewood, Bergenfield, Bergen County, and throughout the State. Congressman Josh Gottheimer additionally honored the new Council, presenting each member with a flag that he had flown over the U.S. Capitol celebrating their victory.

Public comments echoed the evening’s sense of unity. Police Chief Mike Antista remarked, “Your victories represent the trust and confidence our community has placed in your leadership. Today marks an important day for our city. It’s time to turn the page and work together as one team, one family. The work ahead won’t always be easy, but I’m confident that together we can build a safer, stronger, and more connected community.”

The event’s success was due to the dedication of City employees, especially the Clerk’s Office led by City Clerk Deborah Karlsson, along with the Hackensack Police and Fire Departments.

The City also extends its deepest gratitude to the staff of Hackensack High School for providing a welcoming venue, and to the many educators, Board of Education members, and students in attendance, whose presence underscored Hackensack’s enduring commitment to education.

Mayor Gaines closed with the spirit that defined the Hackensack Unites campaign: “Our role as your city council is to restore and build upon that sense of community.”

“We ran as Hackensack Unites,” Mayor Gaines said. “That’s ‘unites.’ That’s active. That’s ongoing. That’s not done. It’s what we must continue to do to make progress, and together I know we will.”
