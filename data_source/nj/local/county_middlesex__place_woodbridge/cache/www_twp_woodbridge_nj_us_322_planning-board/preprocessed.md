The Planning Board has 9 members who are selected from 4 different classes. The Class I member is the mayor or the mayor's designee. His/Her term of office is the same as his/her official term as mayor. The Class II member is an official (non-elected) from the town, appointed by the mayor. His/Her term of office is 1 year. The Class III member is a member of the town council and is appointed by the governing body. His/Her term of office is 1 year unless he/she completes his/her term as councilperson.

The rest of the Board is made up of Class IV members. These are citizens of the town who have been appointed by the mayor. Their term of office is 4 years. Their terms are staggered so that not all are up for reappointment in any one year.


The Planning Board is responsible for reviewing and approving applications for development and subdivisions in permitted zones, reviewing the Master Plan and any amendments thereto, conditional use applications, review capital improvements, bond ordinances and changes in land use ordinances.
Special meetings and executive sessions of the Planning Board will be scheduled at the call of the Chair.
