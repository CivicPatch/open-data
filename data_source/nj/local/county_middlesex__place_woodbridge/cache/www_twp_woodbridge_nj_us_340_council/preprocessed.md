The Municipal Clerk and his staff serve as secretary to the governing body, secretary to the municipal corporation, election official and administration official. Additionally, the office handles requests for copies of information for the public required to be kept on file, and records birth and death certificates, processes marriage licenses, voter registration forms, etc. The office also receives all applications for bingo and raffle licenses and issues permits required by Ordinance for garage sales, parking, etc.
Formal action will be taken at a Council Meeting / Work Session. Executive Session may also take place in accordance with state statutes.
