====================

**New Mayor Office Hours**

**Jennifer L. Kuhn, Mayor**

As part of our continued effort to promote transparency, accountability, and accessible leadership, the Mayor’s Office is pleased to introduce
**“Meet the Mayor” sessions**
, giving residents more opportunities to engage directly with the executive branch of Jackson Township's government.

Under Jackson’s Faulkner Act “Mayor-Council” form of government, the Mayor serves as the chief executive officer, overseeing the day-to-day operations of the township, implementing policies adopted by the Council, and ensuring the effective delivery of municipal services. These sessions will provide residents a direct channel to discuss administrative matters, township operations, and community concerns.

Residents will be able to attend scheduled Office Hours or sign up for one-on-one meetings with the Mayor at Town Hall. These meetings are designed to give residents a voice in how services are delivered, how local departments are functioning, and how the administration is meeting the community’s needs.

Additionally, “Meet the Mayor” events will be hosted periodically in an informal, public setting offering a chance for candid conversation about current initiatives, township priorities, and everyday challenges impacting our neighborhoods.

These sessions are open to all Jackson residents and aim to foster a collaborative environment where questions are welcomed, feedback is encouraged, and solutions are explored together.

More information including a full schedule of office hours and the first “Meet the Mayor” dates will be available soon on the official Jackson Township website and social media platforms.

Together, we’re building a more responsive, engaged, and forward-thinking Jackson Township.
