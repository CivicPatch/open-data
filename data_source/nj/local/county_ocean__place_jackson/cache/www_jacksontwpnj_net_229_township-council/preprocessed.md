**From the desk of Council President Mordy Burnstein:**

The Jackson Township Council is pleased to announce the launch of new
sessions and
, providing residents with additional opportunities to engage directly with their elected officials.
These sessions are designed to strengthen communication between residents and local leadership by providing residents with an opportunity to share their concerns, ideas, and feedback directly with council members.

Each council member will soon have dedicated “Council Hours” at Town Hall, allowing residents to schedule one-on-one meetings. A full schedule of available times will be published on the Jackson Township website in the coming weeks.

The “Meet the Council” sessions will take place in the Town Hall main meeting room and will feature two council members at each event. These sessions will provide a casual, small-group setting for open discussion about current township issues, projects, and community initiatives.

Meetings will be held regularly throughout the year to foster ongoing dialogue beyond formal council meetings.

These will be open, public meet-and-greet events. Residents can bring up any topic—parks, policing, housing, development, or even the rumors that often circulate on social media. The agenda will be set by the people, not the council.”
Further details, including dates and times for the first sessions, will be announced soon on the official Jackson Township website and social media channels.

**-Council President Mordy Burnstein**
