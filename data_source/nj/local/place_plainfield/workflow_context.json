Hockaday's previous term ended in December 2024, but he is listed on the '2026 Plainfield City Council' as Vice President & Councilman-At-Large, implying re-election for a term likely ending December 31, 2028. Robert Graham is identified as the First Ward Councilman in 2025, but his specific term end date was not found."
