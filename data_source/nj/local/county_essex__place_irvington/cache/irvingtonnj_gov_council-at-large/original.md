Darlene Brown, Council At-Large
-------------------------------

Darlene Brown, a resident of Irvington for 39 years, is very active in her community. I am a mother of four and a grandmother of four beautiful and wonderful grandchildren. She is currently employed at Irvington Public Schools as Chief of Security.

I currently serve as South Ward District Leader and President of Campfield Block Association for over 7 years to current. In 2014, I was a Commissioner for the Irvington Housing Authority and was appointed Chairwoman from 2017 until 2022. I also served as an Aide to Assemblyman Ralph Caputo in the 28th Legislative District.

As a resident of Irvington, I am constantly looking for solutions to make a difference in the lives of stakeholders in the Township of Irvington. I love the fact that our children and seniors are very important characters and actors in our lives and the development of our town; I call them the beginning and the future.  
I am a proud member of Jehovah Jireh Praise Worship Church Center in Newark, NJ.  
Bishop Rudy V. and Lady Carlton have been a member for 20 years.

I look forward to working with a team of individuals committed to the well-being and growth of the Township of Irvington. Together with the current leadership and members of the Irvington Municipal Council.  
Finally, I feel my energy will support every endeavor that would promote the well-being of the Township of Irvington and the community.

Again, thank you in advance for considering this vital tool for growth as Councilwoman At-Large.  
Proverbs 18:16 is a powerful statement that reveals the answer: “A man’s gift makes room for him and brings him before great men. What you were designed to be known for is your gift. God has given every person a gift or talent that the world will make room for.
