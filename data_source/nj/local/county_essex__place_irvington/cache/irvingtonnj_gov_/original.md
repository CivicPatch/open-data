--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<https://irvington.newjerseytaxsale.com>  
TAX SALE WILL BE HELD DECEMBER 18, 2025 AT 9:00 AM
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Friendly Reminder

Friendly Reminder
-----------------

Please be reminded that all outstanding municipal charges will be included in our annual tax sale.

On November 11th, all properties with delinquencies (due November 1st and prior) must be included in the accelerated tax sale and will be subject to additional fees as required by State law. For all delinquent payments received after November 10th, certified funds payable to the Township of Irvington (**certified check, money order, or cashier’s check**) will be required. No online payment options, no cash and no personal checks will be accepted. Please call 973-399-6613 for updated interest amounts due.

Pursuant to N.J.S.A 54:4-64, taxes are valid whether or not the taxpayer (or their authorized agent) receives a bill. The statutes indicate that the taxpayer is “put on notice to ascertain from the proper official” the amount of their tax or assessment liabilities. This statute applies to **All Municipal Charges**.

If you are having problems with receiving your bills, please notify your local Post Office.

Online payment options are suspended as of the **close of business hours** (4:30 pm) on November 10th due to the township’s annual tax sale process and will be reactivated after the tax sale is complete.

Please be advised that should your payments be returned for nonpayment for any reason (including rejected online payments, stop payments, NSF, etc.) you will be required to remit payments via certified funds only for a minimum of 1 (one) year.

**Tax Sale: December 18, 2025**

The Township of Irvington is an accelerated tax sale municipality.

It is the obligation of the tax collector to collect all property taxes, sewer, and other municipal charges in the year that they are due. This helps greatly reduce the reserve for uncollected taxes, helping to keep the tax levy flat.

As a courtesy, the Tax Collector mails delinquent “reminder” notices throughout the year. Due to limited timing, delinquent notices are not mailed for outstanding charges as of November 10th. Helpful information is also printed on the back of all tax bills.

To avoid the tax sale process, property owners must pay all municipal charges in full by November 10th. Unfortunately, postmarks cannot be honored.

The tax sale list will be published in a local paper, posted on the township’s website, and posted in 5 public places. (N.J.S.A. 54:5-26)

Once the tax sale is generated, a fee of $65-$150 is added to each delinquent account as required by state law and **cannot be waived**. The fee is comprised of a 2% cost of sale charge, with a minimum $15 and a maximum $100, and the cost of 2 tax sale mailings at $25 each. (N.J.S.A. 54:5-38, N.J.S.A. 54:5-26)
