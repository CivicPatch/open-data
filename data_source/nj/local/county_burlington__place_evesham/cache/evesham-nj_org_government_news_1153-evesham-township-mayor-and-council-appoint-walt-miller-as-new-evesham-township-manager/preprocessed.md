Evesham Township Mayor and Council’s search for a new township manager has concluded with the appointment of Walt Miller – a nearly 30-year resident of Evesham Township and a name well known and highly respected by those across a wide swath of the Evesham community.

Many residents and other members of the community will know Miller from his time serving with the Evesham Township Police Department, where he began as patrol officer in 1997 and would go on to hold supervisory ranks in each of the agency’s command bureaus before earning the rank of Captain in 2013 and eventually become Chief of Police in 2022.

Miller announced his retirement from the department this past December, ending his tremendously accomplished 28-year career in law enforcement.

Among his many certifications and trainings in and out of his policing career, Miller holds a Master of Administrative Science Degree from Fairleigh Dickinson University, with Certificates in Law Enforcement Executive Studies & Global Leadership.
Miller also graduated the Certified Public Manager (CPM) program through Rutgers University School of Public Affairs & Administration, after which he joined the faculty as a part-time professor for the University, teaching Organizational Communication, Leading Change, Managing Teams, Problem Solving & Decision Making, Project Management as well as Risk Management.
Miller also serves as a part-time professor for Fairleigh Dickinson University, School of Public and Global Affairs teaching Executive Leadership.
In Miller’s new role as Township Manager for Evesham Township, he will serve as the municipality’s chief executive and administrative official in all day-to-day operations.

With Evesham ranking as the most populated municipality in Burlington County, Miller will oversee multiple departments with hundreds of employees who work every day to serve the township’s nearly 50,000 residents.

Miller will also be responsible for working to carry out any policy decisions approved by Mayor and Council.

Mayor Jaclyn Veasy spoke to Miller’s dedication to the community and willingness to always do whatever he can to serve others.

“Walt Miller’s willingness to serve the Evesham community is without question,” Mayor Veasy said. “He’s a natural leader, who also values the importance of working with others to ensure everyone’s unique skills contribute to the best outcomes possible. He has repeatedly demonstrated his ability to anticipate the needs of future and plan accordingly. His appointment as township manager will bring a level of continuity and experience that ensures Evesham Township has steady and forward thinking leadership.”

Walt Miller shared, “I am very grateful for the opportunity to continue my service in this community.  I know that I have much more to contribute, that will have a positive impact on our municipal services, our residents and our staff.   I want to thank Mayor Jaclyn Veasy and Council for trusting me to serve as the Township Manager, here in this great community, a place I am proud to call my home.  I know the future of this community is bright, and together we will accomplish some great things.”

Beyond his professional career, Miller is also regarded in the community for his role in youth sports and volunteer efforts.

He served as a trustee for the Marlton Recreation Council, which oversees youth sports for more than 6,500 children each year. Miller previously served as the organization’s president for four years and has held coaching and other roles for nearly two decades. He also previously served on the Evesham Township Human Rights Advisory Council as a representative for youth sports.

Miller also founded the nonprofit Evesham Heroes Fund, which supports fundraising efforts for families of local fallen first responders. He and his family also established the non-profit “Hands Uniting Generations – HUGS” organization to run local collection drives and other fundraising efforts for charitable causes.

Mayor and Council proudly and unanimously appointed Miller to the township manager role at a Special Council Meeting on May 28.

Miller will replace Acting Township Manager Kevin Rijs, who regularly serves as Director of the Office of Community Development and who had been simultaneously serving as Acting Manager on a temporary basis. Mayor and Council thank Mr. Rijs for his efforts as Acting Manger during the search to permanently fill the role.

Congratulations again to Evesham Township Manager Walt Miller on behalf of Mayor Veasy, Deputy Mayor Dr. Krystal Hunter, Councilwoman Heather Cooper, Councilman Joe Fisicaro, Jr. and Councilman Christian Smith.
