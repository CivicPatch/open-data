Evesham Township Council created the township’s first-ever Disability And Veterans Affairs Advisory Committee in 2019.

This committee consists of mayoral appointees who research programs and other opportunities for the township to better serve its veteran populations and populations who experience disabilities.
Members of the committee include residents who experience disabilities, residents who are veterans, residents who are caregivers to veterans or those who experience disabilities, members involved with service providers for disabled persons or veterans, members who are health-care practitioners for disabled persons or veterans, members of advocacy groups and elected officials.
The committee ensures the voices, concerns and ideas of Evesham’s veteran and disabled communities are heard.
