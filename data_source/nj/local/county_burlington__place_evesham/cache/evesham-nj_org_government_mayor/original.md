Under her leadership, the township has also been able to secure millions of dollars in county, state and federal grants for road improvement projects, open space preservation, park improvements and other additional services, thereby freeing up more local funding for other projects across the community.

### Deputy Mayor Heather Cooper

Evesham Township Deputy Mayor Heather Cooper is currently serving her second term on the Township Council. A proud resident of Evesham since 2013, Heather, along with her husband and boys, is deeply committed to building a vibrant, inclusive community where all residents can thrive.

With over 25 years of experience in the Human Services field, Heather brings a wealth of knowledge and dedication to her role on the council. She holds a Master’s degree in Public Administration from Rutgers University through the Center for Executive Leadership in Government, a testament to her passion for public service and leadership. She also holds a certification through the Society of Human Resources Management (SHRM).

Heather has spearheaded many initiatives for Evesham residents through community partnerships on both the local and state level. She continues to advocate and bring forward the ideas from residents on policy issues that impact her community. Her career has been dedicated to helping people connect to the resources and services they need to empower and support autonomy, investing in youth leadership and development to secure a positive outlook for Evesham into the future.

From the expansion of the townships Disability & Veterans Advisory Committee and the first Human Rights Advisory Council in Evesham, raising awareness through the first of many cultural events and educational awareness for citizens who experience disabilities has been paramount to remain an inclusive community.

In collaboration with the Mayor and Council, she's worked to ensure the township secured millions of dollars in grant opportunities to supplement funding for the needs of Evesham, including, roads, parks, preserving opens space and many other environmental projects and initiatives; while maintaining fiscal responsibility as stewards of the townships resources.

Additionally, serving on the Municipal Alliance, she's worked to ensure the township expanded its support families that have lost loved ones to substance abuse disorders as well as programs to support those in recovery. These resources continue to expand and connect all underserved and under represented groups in our community. Areas include Anti-bullying  and stigma free efforts, along with public safety and mental health training to First Responders, promoting mental health awareness for our most vulnerable population, our youth and seniors.

She's also proud to support efforts on behalf of Evesham Township to obtain the Governor’s “We Value our Veterans” Award and a certification from the NJ State Veterans Chamber of Commerce to be a “Veteran Friendly Municipality” in 2019. The ongoing efforts to provide recognition and support and most importantly, share the stories of our Veterans is a continued focus.

In addition, she's worked to spearhead the preservation of Evesham Township’s history, including historic areas of our black history and the many Underground Railroad stops; a historic black community enclave from the 1800’s, and a historic burial ground that includes black Americans and Veterans. This also encompasses areas that are a historic part of the Indigenous ancestors to  the Lenni-Lenape Tribe in our community. This work stems from a goal of "Celebrating Diversity as our strength here in Evesham."

Heathers inspiration comes from spending time with our future leaders including her own boys and working collaboratively with the voices of our residents. Heather’s public service begins most early mornings starting her day in the gym or on her yoga mat, as she begins the day with gratitude and hope for the future.
