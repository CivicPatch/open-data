She continues to advocate and bring forward the ideas from residents on policy issues that impact her community. Her career has been dedicated to helping people connect to the resources and services they need to empower and support autonomy, investing in youth leadership and development to secure a positive outlook for Evesham into the future.
From the expansion of the townships Disability & Veterans Advisory Committee and the first Human Rights Advisory Council in Evesham, raising awareness through the first of many cultural events and educational awareness for citizens who experience disabilities has been paramount to remain an inclusive community.

In collaboration with the Mayor and Council, she's worked to ensure the township secured millions of dollars in grant opportunities to supplement funding for the needs of Evesham, including, roads, parks, preserving opens space and many other environmental projects and initiatives; while maintaining fiscal responsibility as stewards of the townships resources.

Additionally, serving on the Municipal Alliance, she's worked to ensure the township expanded its support families that have lost loved ones to substance abuse disorders as well as programs to support those in recovery. These resources continue to expand and connect all underserved and under represented groups in our community. Areas include Anti-bullying  and stigma free efforts, along with public safety and mental health training to First Responders, promoting mental health awareness for our most vulnerable population, our youth and seniors.

She's also proud to support efforts on behalf of Evesham Township to obtain the Governor’s “We Value our Veterans” Award and a certification from the NJ State Veterans Chamber of Commerce to be a “Veteran Friendly Municipality” in 2019. The ongoing efforts to provide recognition and support and most importantly, share the stories of our Veterans is a continued focus.

In addition, she's worked to spearhead the preservation of Evesham Township’s history, including historic areas of our black history and the many Underground Railroad stops; a historic black community enclave from the 1800’s, and a historic burial ground that includes black Americans and Veterans. This also encompasses areas that are a historic part of the Indigenous ancestors to  the Lenni-Lenape Tribe in our community. This work stems from a goal of "Celebrating Diversity as our strength here in Evesham."

Heathers inspiration comes from spending time with our future leaders including her own boys and working collaboratively with the voices of our residents. Heather’s public service begins most early mornings starting her day in the gym or on her yoga mat, as she begins the day with gratitude and hope for the future.
