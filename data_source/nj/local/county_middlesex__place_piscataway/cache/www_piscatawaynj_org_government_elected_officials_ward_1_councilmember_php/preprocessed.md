Councilmember Frank Uhrin (Ward 1)
----------------------------------

* Ward 1 Councilmember Frank Uhrin


For boys growing up in Westfield in the 1960s, being a part of the Boy Scouts and the Sons of the American Legion seemed to be as common as going to school. A young Frank Uhrin was raised always busy and always volunteering, both of which made him happy and still do.
The middle child of Frank, Sr. & Helen with two sisters, Frank would very much look forward to Memorial Day when he and other neighborhood boys would get up at 5 a.m. to place American flags throughout the town and on the gravesites of deceased veterans. The highlight of Frank’s day was marching in the town parade with other boys behind the American Legion color guard in which his father served. When the color guard twice shot their rifles in salute – once on the parade route in the middle of town and the other at the cemetery – Frank and the other boys would quickly scrounge around the ground to pick up the shell casings.
Despite his and his father’s activism in veteran issues and patriotic events, Frank did not learn until the year 2000 that Frank, Sr. had served on Normandy Beach in World War II, a story told by Frank’s uncle on the day Frank’s father died. Frank, Sr. was a person of humility, work ethic, community, and service – traits that Frank would very much assume himself.
On his way to becoming an adult, Frank would also play Little League baseball and serve as an altar boy at Holy Trinity Church. As a teenager he was lucky to get a part-time job at the A&P supermarket in Clark because that is where he would meet his future wife Kathy.
After graduating from Holy Trinity High School, Frank would rise the A&P manager ladder and marry Kathy in 1975. The young couple rented an Edison apartment for a short while, then, prompted by one of Frank’s sisters living in Piscataway, would buy their home in the Township in 1977 – the same house they still live in today.
Frank & Kathy would raise three sons in Piscataway: Frank III, Thomas, and Robert whom would all share their father’s passion for boy scouting and each achieve the rank of Eagle Scout. Frank enjoyed serving in scout master positions, taking the neighborhood boys of Piscataway on camping trips each month and well-enjoyed annual June canoe trips on the Delaware River. Even though all of Frank & Kathy’s sons are all now adults, Frank still volunteers with the Boy Scouts, serving as a merit badge counselor for the Patriots Path Council for the Boy Scouts of the Raritan Valley area.
Frank also returned to his Little League roots. As his sons all played and Kathy worked as secretary and challenger division to then Little League President and Councilmember Jim Bullard, Frank would volunteer as a coach and equipment manager. Eventually, Frank would be put on the Little League Board as President as well as the Township’s recreation commission.

What greatly endeared Frank to public service was dealing with the aftermath of a 2006 fire that destroyed the Piscataway Little League building. With a group of Little League volunteers, Frank went to Mayor Brian C. Wahler to seek help in rebuilding it. The response was unexpected and fantastic: the Township would take responsibility for the facilities, reconstruct the building with a modern kitchen and bathrooms, as well as replace the old fencing and light poles.
In 2007, former Mayor Ted Light encouraged Frank to join the Piscataway Democratic Organization as a Committeeman. When Councilmember Mark Hardenberg decided to retire, Frank ran to succeed him in 2014 and was elected to represent Ward 1 on the Township Council. Since then, he has won both of his re-election bids in 2018 and 2022 and was named Council President in 2019 and 2023 by his colleagues.
Frank still dedicates much of his time to youth sports, not only as the current President of Piscataway Little League, but also as a Commissioner of Piscataway Pop Warner and a member of the Central Jersey Pop Warner Board. In fact, Frank was inducted into the Central Jersey Pop Warner Hall of Fame for years of dedication and devotion to the youth of central New Jersey and Piscataway Pop Warner.
Complementing this work for the youth is his service as a member of the Township's
Community Outreach Advisory Board
which helps prevent substance abuse. He also serves on the
Senior Citizen Advisory Commission
, taking the place of the late Councilmember Jim Bullard after his passing in 2023, and hosted an awesome
Family Fun Night with the Somerset Patriots
. In 2023-2024, Frank received the distinguished Citizenship Award from the Elks Lodge.
Having retired from his professional career after 47 years, Frank remains busy with public service and volunteering, and as always, couldn't be happier.
Councilmember Frank Uhrin was elected to his third 4-year term in November of 2022. His current term expires on December 31, 2026.
