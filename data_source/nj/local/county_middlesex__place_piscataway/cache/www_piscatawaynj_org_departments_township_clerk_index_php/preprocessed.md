In New Jersey, the Clerk occupies one of the most important and exacting positions in municipal government. In many instances, it is the hub of municipal operations. The Clerk, by virtue of his or her position, serves as a liaison officer between the governing officials and the taxpayers and between the executive and the general body of municipal personnel. The Municipal Clerk is an important public relations figure in municipal personnel.
The Core Duties of the Municipal Clerk include:

* Serving as the chief administrative official in all elections held in the municipality, subject to the requirements of Title 19 of the Revised Statues.
* Serving as the chief registrar of voters in the municipality, subject to the requirements of Title 19 of the Revised Statues.

In addition to the core duties, the Municipal Clerk's is responsible to perform a variety of other functions such as receiving and forwarding Notice of Claims, researching requests, updating Municipal Officials lists, Code Book maintenance, disclosure statements, oaths, tax appeals, stream encroachment permits, contracts, custodian of bonds, and receipt of single family dwelling notices. Purchase orders are completed for necessary supplies for the Council members and for the Clerk's Office. Applications for Bingo, Raffle and Liquor Licenses need to be approved. Each year, work is done for multiple dwelling registrations, limo and taxi services, and directories for various companies. Also numerous phone calls and helping the public with various questions take up most of the day's time.
The Municipal Clerk's Office is now responsible for two elections: the Primary Election, which is held in June, as well as the General Election, which is held in November. In preparing for these elections, the Municipal Clerk's Office must provide various certifications, prepare District Workers' bags and provide payment to the District Workers. The office must be staffed prior to the opening of the polls until the closing of polls and tallying of results.
There are many responsibilities involved in working as the Council's Secretary. Before each meeting an Agenda is prepared. After each meeting various letters are typed and advertisements made. Minutes must then be prepared. Resolutions of Recognition are done for almost every meeting, and various originals need to be made.
The Municipal Clerk's Office is always willing to develop public good will and inform the public. In our busy schedule we will always direct your inquiry to the appropriate department and/or help in any way we can with your needs.
