The applicants must comply with all applicable laws and [requirements](https://www.nj.gov/health/vital/registration-vital/marriage-licenses/).  
  
Applicants must appear before the Licensing Officer and make the application.

On 7/10/2004 became effective the Domestic Partnership Act of NJ, amended by the Civil Union Act on 2/19/2007, allowing the registration of Domestic Partners to couples 62 or older of either same-sex or opposite-sex. For registering a domestic partnership, the couples must meet the [eligibility requirements.](https://www.nj.gov/health/vital/registration-vital/domestic-partnerships/)

The applicants, along with a witness, must sign the application, under oath, before the Licensing Officer. ID required.
