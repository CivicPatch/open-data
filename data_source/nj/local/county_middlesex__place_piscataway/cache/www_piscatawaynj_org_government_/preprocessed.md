In 1967 Piscataway residents voted to form a Mayor-Council form of government, authorized under Plan F of the “Faulkner Act of 1950.”  It provides for the direct election of the Mayor, who acts as the Chief Executive and Administrative Officer, and seven (7) Council members, who act as the municipal legislature. In Piscataway, the Council is made up of seven (7) members - four (4) ward members each representing one ward each as well as three (3) at-large members who represent the entire Township - and serve in staggered four-year terms.
The Mayor-Council form of government also establishes the separation of legislative power from administrative functions and provides for the employment of full-time professional personnel to perform governmental functions relating to administration, finance, public safety, engineering, public works, health, recreation and law. This system requires constant consultation between the Mayor and Council, as each acts as a check-and-balance on the other.
