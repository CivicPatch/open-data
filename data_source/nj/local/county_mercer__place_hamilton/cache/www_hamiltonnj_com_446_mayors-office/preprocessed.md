Message From Hamilton Township Mayor Jeff Martin
------------------------------------------------

Greetings and welcome! Thank you for visiting the Hamilton Township website. It is the perfect place to get to know our great hometown.

Hamilton Township is filled with great parks, more than 60 in total, including the amazing Veteran's Park which covers 350 acres of woods, athletic fields, skate-park, dog park, tennis courts and miles of walking and biking trails. We also have the beautiful Sayen Gardens, recognized by the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, with its strolling gardens and fountains. In addition to the public parks, we're also home to the "must-see" Grounds for Sculpture, with over forty acres of contemporary sculpture-filled gardens that draw visitors from all over the world.

If you're shopping for a home, Hamilton has something in everyone's price range and in any type of neighborhood from urban, suburban or rural. With our outstanding schools, an "A"-rated hospital and our nationally accredited senior center, Hamilton has it all!
Hamilton is a great hometown community made up of many neighborhoods, each one with its own charm, but all Hamilton Proud. It is a big municipality with a very small-town feel. Whatever your reason for visiting, Hamilton welcomes you.

If you don't find what you're looking for on our website, please give us a call through our
[HAMStat contact center](https://www.hamiltonnj.com/hamstat)
at 609-586-0311 or stop by any Township office. Hamilton's employees and I are always here to serve you. If you have any ideas, suggestions, or feedback, please contact me. I am always glad to listen and happy to hear from everyone.

Sincerely,
Jeffrey S. Martin
Mayor
