Message From Hamilton Township Mayor Jeff Martin
------------------------------------------------

Hamilton Township is filled with great parks, more than 60 in total, including the amazing Veteran's Park which covers 350 acres of woods, athletic fields, skate-park, dog park, tennis courts and miles of walking and biking trails. We also have the beautiful Sayen Gardens, recognized by the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, with its strolling gardens and fountains. In addition to the public parks, we're also home to the "must-see" Grounds for Sculpture, with over forty acres of contemporary sculpture-filled gardens that draw visitors from all over the world.

If you don't find what you're looking for on our website, please give us a call through our
[HAMStat contact center](https://www.hamiltonnj.com/hamstat)
at 609-586-0311 or stop by any Township office. Hamilton's employees and I are always here to serve you. If you have any ideas, suggestions, or feedback, please contact me. I am always glad to listen and happy to hear from everyone.

Sincerely,
Jeffrey S. Martin
Mayor
