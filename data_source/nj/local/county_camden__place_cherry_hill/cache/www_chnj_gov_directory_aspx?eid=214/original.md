Mayor Dave Fleisher is an experienced community and business leader dedicated to serving Cherry Hill and ensuring the Township is the best place to live, work, play and raise a family.

He is committed to fiscal responsibility, public safety, open and accountable government, preservation of parks and open space, and sustainability.

Prior to his election as Mayor in November 2023, Dave served for many years as president of Cherry Hill Township Council. He was the youngest member ever elected to Council when he began his first term at age 27.

Dave has been a driving force for open space preservation throughout the Township, including Holly Ravine Farm and the Kingston Swim Club property. While on Council, he also successfully led the passage of a comprehensive ordinance that protects Cherry Hill’s prized trees from being lost to development.

Dave is the co-founder of the Cherry Hill Human Relations Advisory Council and was instrumental in the building of the Cherry Hill Library.

He has held numerous community volunteer positions, including coach for the Cherry Hill Atlantic Little League, a Cherry Hill East Soccer Booster, and a trustee for the Jewish Family and Children’s Service of Southern New Jersey.

He also served as a member of the State of N.J. Government Records Council, which ensures government transparency statewide.

Raised in Cherry Hill, Dave is a graduate of Cherry Hill High School East and Ithaca College, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in finance. He is president and managing partner with a successful financial planning firm in the Delaware Valley.

Dave and his wife, Jen, are proud parents of three children.
