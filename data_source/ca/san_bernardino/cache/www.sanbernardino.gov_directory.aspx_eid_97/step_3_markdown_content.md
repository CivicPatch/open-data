## Biography

Sandra Ibarra was elected to the Second Ward City Council Member seat on November 6th, 2018. Prior to running for office, Sandra volunteered in several capacities:

Sandra Ibarra served the Second Ward as a City Commissioner on two different Commissions: Community Development Citizen Advisory Committee and the Fine Arts Commission. Sandra has been heavily involved with Neighborhood Watch, Neighborhood Associations, and CERT (Community Emergency Response Team).

This community involvement pushes Sandra to be a transparent and accountable councilwoman for her constituents in the Second Ward. Her top priorities for the Second Ward, and the city as a whole, are public safety, community engagement, and the beautification of San Bernardino, CA. She seeks to empower the San Bernardino citizens and welcomes new businesses to come into our region. She is a first-time homeowner and works for a local non-profit that values and encourages homeownership.

Sandra Ibarra was born and raised in Santa Ana, CA. As the oldest of six children and a first-generation student, she was detected as a GATE (Gifted And Talented Education) and Honors student at a very young age, resulting in her getting accepted and graduating from UCLA in 2003. She highly believes it is time to set higher standards for our city and our leaders in order to make change happen for the good of all.
