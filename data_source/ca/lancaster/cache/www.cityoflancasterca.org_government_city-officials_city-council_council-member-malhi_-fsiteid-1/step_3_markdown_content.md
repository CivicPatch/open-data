Raj Malhi has been a resident of the Antelope Valley for decades. He was born in the Punjab state, in India. His parents moved their family to America when he was 15 years old, in order to seek their American Dream in the Antelope Valley.

As a Planning Commissioner, Raj's business experience helped in job creation and economic development efforts. He was appointed to City Council in 2015.
