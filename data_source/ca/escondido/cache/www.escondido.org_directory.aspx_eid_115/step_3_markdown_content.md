Christian Garcia is a San Diego native. He was raised in North County San Diego and has always called this area home. He is the son of Mexican parents and the fourth of five children. His family has always taught him to love this country, take advantage of the opportunities that are presented, and in return, serve the community which has offered him so much.

After graduating high school, Christian attended UC Irvine where he received his bachelors degree in political science and international relations. He was a full time student, served as president of his college club and worked his way through college as a server. After college, Christian served in the United States Peace Corps in Cambodia for two years where he served as a teacher for two years. Here he learned humility by serving others with love and compassion.

After coming back home, Christian received his masters degree in public policy from USC. He worked for two years through grad school in international logistics, then worked in data and supply chain for several years after. He returned to North County San Diego in 2015, where he has worked as a teacher.

He has become an active member in the community looking to expand on the lessons he learned in the Peace Corps. He has served as president of his HOA, has been active in a local Latino political organizations, served as a trustee at Palomar Community College and now serves as a city council member.

He loves serving his community, is passionate about improving the lives of his family and neighbors, and plans to continue serving in anyway he can.
