## Office of the Mayor / [About The Mayor](https://www.fresno.gov/mayor/)

![Mayor-Dyer-2-10w603-(1)](https://www.fresno.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mayor-Dyer-2-10w603-1.jpg)

Jerry P. Dyer is the City of Fresno’s 26th Mayor, sworn into office on Jan. 5, 2021.

On March 5, 2024, he was overwhelmingly elected to a second four-year term. With his “One Fresno” vision, Mayor Dyer continues to seek an inclusive, prosperous, beautiful city where people take pride in their neighborhoods and community, as well as a government that listens, keeps its promises, and is owned by the people.

Since taking office, Mayor Dyer has led several successful initiatives that reflect his vision, including “Project Off-Ramp,” which relocated more than 650 unhoused individuals from Fresno’s freeways. Of that total, more than 80% accepted services and shelter.  In 2023, the City of Fresno was one of the only cities in California to reduce homelessness and continues to see 95% of those exiting homelessness remaining in housing and living productive lives years later.

Another successful initiative is Beautify Fresno, which has greatly enhanced the city’s curb appeal while inspiring an unprecedented level of community involvement. Volunteers from all corners of Fresno regularly come together on weekends to clean up trash, beautify neighborhoods, and restore a sense of pride- not only in their own neighborhoods but also in parts of the city far from their homes.

Under Mayor Dyer’s leadership, the City’s core is undergoing an unprecedented transformation. With nearly $300 million in public infrastructure funding, major improvements to Downtown Fresno’s and Chinatown’s water and wastewater systems are already underway. In addition, he recently introduced a free trolley service connecting downtown to Fresno State via the Mural and Tower Districts, Fresno City College and the Blackstone Corridor.  This represents part of Mayor Dyer’s broader vision for a vibrant, walkable downtown with full-time residents, thriving businesses, cultural venues, and a lively entertainment scene.

A champion for housing, Mayor Dyer continues to prioritize diverse solutions through his One Fresno Housing Strategy.  This comprehensive plan aims to meet the needs of all residents, from low-income and workforce to market-rate developments, with the goal of ensuring a stable housing market.

Mayor Dyer also has a long history of investing in Fresno’s youth.  He has launched several initiatives, including the 2021 renovation of Camp Fresno, a transformative project offering youth a chance to connect with nature and create lifelong memories.   Another key initiative is the One Fresno Youth Jobs Corps Program, which offers hundreds of hard-to-employ young adults the opportunity to overcome barriers and gain skills through a City-paid internship designed to lead to full-time employment and, ultimately, pathways to homeownership.

Before becoming Mayor, Jerry Dyer served 40 years with distinction in the Fresno Police Department, including the final 18 as the City’s longest-serving Police Chief. This experience provides him with unique insights into the City’s operations and drives his belief that government exists to serve the people, which is reflected in his One Fresno motto: “We Work For You.”

A proud Fresno native, Mayor Dyer grew up in the Fowler area and graduated from Fowler High School. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Criminology from California State University, Fresno, and a master’s degree in management from California Polytechnic University, Pomona. Mayor Dyer’s commitment to service extends beyond the office.  In 2018, he was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Fresno County Office of Education and was named a Paul Harris Fellow for Rotary International.

Mayor Dyer’s life story is one of service, leadership, and a deep commitment to family and community.  He and his wife, Diane, were married in 1980 and have been blessed with two children and five grandchildren.

As Mayor Dyer embarks on his second term, he remains dedicated to giving Fresno a brighter, more dynamic, and more unified future.
