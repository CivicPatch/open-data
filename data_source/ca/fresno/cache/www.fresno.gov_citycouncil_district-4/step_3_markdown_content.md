### Welcome to District 4!

To My District 4 Friends and Neighbors,

These past three years as your Fresno City Councilmember have been a true privilege. I am honored to have the opportunity to serve your family and our community as we work to build a Fresno we can all be proud of.

We have accomplished so much together these past few years and I will continue to work to deliver a better Fresno going forward.

Hiring record numbers of police officers, cleaning up our neighborhood parks, working to house our unhoused population, and fixing our broken roads have been, and will continue to be, some of my top priorities.

Have a question or a comment regarding your neighborhood? Please don’t hesitate to contact me and my staff.

Thank you again for the opportunity to serve you and your families at City Hall.

Sincerely,  
Tyler Maxwell

### Catalytic Converter Ordinance

![CATCONV](https://www.fresno.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CATCONV-1024x745.jpg)

As your council member, I am proud to have passed an ordinance that protects our residents from the rising problem of catalytic converter thefts. The victims of these thefts often face costly repairs, inconvenience, and insecurity.

The ordinance makes it illegal for anyone other than a licensed core recycler to possess a detached catalytic converter without valid proof of ownership. This proof can include a bill of sale, documentation from an auto-body shop, or verifiable electronic communication from the previous owner. Anyone who violates this ordinance can face a fine of up to $1,000, jail time of up to 12 months, or both. The ordinance also allows the city to revoke the permit of any core recycler who is found to be in violation of any applicable law.

This ordinance will help protect our residents from the costly and inconvenient consequences of catalytic converter thefts, as well as deter criminals from engaging in this activity. By requiring proof of ownership, we can help law enforcement identify and prosecute thieves, and prevent them from profiting from their crimes.

### Wage Protection Program

The City of Fresno’s Wage Protection Program is committed to fostering a fair and equitable working environment within the city, safeguarding the rights and livelihoods of all workers, and promoting fair business practices.

The City of Fresno’s Wage Protection Program is a city-led initiative designed to combat and prevent wage theft, ensuring that workers within the City of Fresno receive the compensation they are legally owed. Led by Councilmember Tyler Maxwell and the City Attorney’s Office, this comprehensive program combines education for both workers and businesses, policy advocacy, and enforcement to address and rectify instances of wage theft across various industries within the city.

To educate the public and businesses on common forms of wage theft, the City Attorney’s Office will conduct informational workshops for both workers and employers  
beginning August 20th. These workshops will provide information on how the program works, how to file a complaint, and best practices to avoid wage theft claims.

**For any general questions call 559-621-7500**

### Eviction Protection Program (EPP)

**WHAT IS EPP?**

The Eviction Protection Program (EPP) protects tenants renting apartments or homes from *unlawful* evictions. If the City determines you are potentially facing such an unlawful eviction, you may be eligible to receive a City-sponsored attorney or legal services to assist you in the judicial process at no charge.

This program is open to any City of Fresno resident who is facing an unlawful eviction regardless of financial or documented status. Common reasons for unlawful evictions include the inability to pay rent because of income loss from COVID-19, retaliation for reporting code enforcement violations, discrimination, unlawful rent increases, and many more.

Once your case is reviewed, the City Attorney’s Office will determine if you need an Attorney or Legal Mediation Services.

**WHO QUALIFIES?**

This program is for residential tenants renting in the City of Fresno.

**HOW CAN EPP HELP?**

Once your case is reviewed, the City Attorney’s Office will determine if you need an Attorney or Legal Mediation Services.

**ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:**
