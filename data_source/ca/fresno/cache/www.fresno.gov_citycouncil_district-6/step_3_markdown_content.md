### Welcome to the Fresno City Council, District 6 website

Born and raised locally, Nick Richardson (Major, USMC Reserve) is a graduate of Buchanan High School (2009) and The Virginia Military Institute (2013), where commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps in May of 2013. A combat helicopter pilot by trade, Nick left the aviation world to join the infantry as a combat aviation liaison and continues in that role today. He has served our nation all over the world on active duty, and has now come home to serve our City. Majoring in Political Science and Modern Languages, Nick is always excited to practice foreign languages, visit diverse cultural events, and lead his Marines on new missions every year to far-off countries. Nick is engaged to his beautiful fiancée (local attorney Kelsey Schulteis, Esquire), and is the oldest of five siblings (Alyssa, Sydney, Dane, and Kai). A lifetime compassionate conservative, Nick has been quick to put party politics aside to focus on a “big tent, small government” platform that prioritizes fiscal responsibility, public engagement, and removing barriers for entrepreneurs to pursue their American dream. Nick is a seasoned water polo player and coach, a registered substitute teacher, a licensed commercial airplane and helicopter pilot, a fitness enthusiast, and a lifetime Mensa member. Nick has no plans to continue a political career after City Hall.
