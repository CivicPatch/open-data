### Welcome Northwest Fresno Residents to your District 2 webpage.

As your city councilmember, it is my honor to serve you. Being born and raised in District 2 and a second-generation small business owner, my family is personally invested in our community. I cherish our neighborhoods in northwest Fresno.

As your councilmember, my priorities are public safety, economic development, and maintaining neighborhood infrastructure and quality of life.

We must do more to ensure the safety of our community. That’s why public safety is my number one priority. Our Police and Fire departments must have the resources necessary to keep us safe.

As a small business owner, I’ve had to balance a budget, hire employees, and deal with bureaucracy. I strongly support fiscally responsible policies and balanced budgets. Government cannot be an impediment to economic expansion. I pledge to fight red tape so we can create more jobs and increase opportunities for small businesses and working families.

Fresno also needs to reinvest in our infrastructure. We need synchronized traffic signals, safer routes to schools, and to complete Veteran’s Boulevard.

These are just some of our office’s priorities. We welcome your input. Your ideas and suggestions will go a long way to help us support policies and actions that will increase the quality of life for northwest Fresno’s residents and businesses. We are here to serve you.
