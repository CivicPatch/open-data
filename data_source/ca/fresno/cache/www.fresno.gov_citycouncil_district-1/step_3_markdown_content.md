Annalisa Perea is a dedicated public servant and urban planner, currently serving as the Fresno City Councilmember for District 1. Born and raised in Fresno, she has deep roots in the community and a lifelong commitment to its development.

Annalisa’s academic journey began at Fresno City College, followed by earning a Bachelor of Science in City and Regional Planning from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. Her professional career as an urban planner has been marked by a focus on expanding park spaces, designing roadway improvements to enhance traffic flow, and building communities that reduce crime and improve pedestrian walkability. She has also been a strong advocate for increasing affordable housing options throughout the Central Valley.

In 2018, Annalisa was elected as a Trustee on the State Center Community College Board of Trustees, where she gained valuable experience in educational policy and community service. Her dedication to public service led to her unanimous appointment to the Fresno City Council on December 9, 2022, filling the seat vacated by Esmeralda Soria. She was sworn into office on December 14, 2022, and subsequently elected as Council Vice President on January 3, 2023. In 2024, she was elected as Council President, serving with distinction throughout the year.

As a councilmember, Annalisa has championed safer neighborhoods, government transparency, affordable housing, and equitable treatment for all residents. She has been particularly active in supporting the LGBTQ+ community and working families, ensuring their voices are heard in city governance. Her policy initiatives include declaring a state of emergency to address affordable housing and homelessness, supporting the Tower District Farmers Market, implementing a local job creation incentive program, and championing the Sidewalk Vending Ordinance to provide opportunities for small entrepreneurs while ensuring public safety and accessibility.

During her tenure as Council President in 2024, Annalisa emphasized a “three-legged stool” approach focusing on public safety, housing, and economic development. She prioritized community-based policing to build trust between neighborhoods and law enforcement, worked on modernizing zoning ordinances to increase affordable housing, and achieved a historic tax-sharing agreement with county partners to unlock potential for economic growth in Fresno.

Annalisa’s leadership is characterized by her proactive approach to community engagement and her commitment to listening to her constituents. She believes in acting on projects and programs that benefit her district and the city at large, embodying the qualities of a bold thinker and natural leader. Her lifelong connection to District 1 deepens her understanding of the issues affecting those living and doing business in the area, driving her dedication to the betterment of the district and the broader Fresno community.

### Lawn to Garden Rebate

**A $1.00 per square foot rebate** is available for the removal of existing lawns when replaced with water-efficient landscapes. The rebate amount is based on the square footage of lawn removed and replaced, up to a maximum of 1,500 square feet.

Many people believe that stunning gardens and beautiful yards are only possible through extensive watering, fertilization, and pesticide application. However, eye-catching gardens and landscapes are easily achieved by employing water-efficient landscaping. These landscapes can help to save water, protect the environment, and require less maintenance than traditional landscapes centered around large lawns.

The Water Conservation Program requires that customers request a Water-Wise Landscape Consultation prior to removing a lawn for the Lawn to Garden rebate. This free service is provided by the Water Conservation Program and includes recommendations for water-wise plants suitable for the Fresno area, irrigation installation, and lawn removal. Customers may request this service through the FresGO app or by calling the City of Fresno’s 311 Center at (559) 621-CITY or by dialing 3-1-1 within City limits.

**Lawn to Garden Application**
