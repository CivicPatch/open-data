## Councilmember / [Brandon Vang](https://www.fresno.gov/citycouncil/district-5/)

![Welcome to District 5! Proudly Representing Southeast Fresno](https://www.fresno.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3D0A3107-10w806-scaled-e1751556209622-896x1024.jpg)

### Welcome to District 5! Proudly Representing Southeast Fresno

I was born in Laos during the Vietnam War. In 1979, my family fled war-torn Laos and resettled in Southern California before making our home in Fresno. I graduated from McLane High School and later earned my degree from UCLA.

Before entering public service, I worked as a probation officer. I was then elected to the Sanger Unified School Board, representing the Sunnyside area, and was re-elected in both 2020 and 2024, each time unopposed. During my tenure, I prioritized increasing graduation rates and expanding equity and access for all students. Under my leadership, the district successfully developed a $250 million junior high and high school education complex in southeast Fresno.

As your Councilmember, my top priorities include strengthening public safety, improving infrastructure, fostering economic development, and supporting small businesses. I am deeply committed to serving the diverse and vibrant communities of District 5.
