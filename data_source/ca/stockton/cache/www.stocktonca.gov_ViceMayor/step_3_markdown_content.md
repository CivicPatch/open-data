## Biography

Jason Lee is a seasoned entrepreneur, media innovator, and community advocate, recently elected to represent District 6 on the Stockton City Council. Known for his role as the CEO and founder of *Hollywood Unlocked*, a leading multimedia entertainment platform valued at over $50 million, Jason’s multifaceted career spans labor relations, business development, and civic engagement.

Jason’s professional journey reflects his versatility and dedication. After working in education and probation for six years, Jason transitioned to labor relations in 2006, joining the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). There, he rose from a union representative and organizer to Staff Director within the Kaiser Permanente division. In 2009, he became a Labor Representative for the California Nurses Association, where he negotiated contracts for registered nurses across private hospitals, earning a reputation for his strategic approach and ability to resolve complex issues.

In 2015, Jason founded *Hollywood Unlocked*, which has since become a major force in entertainment and cultural commentary. The platform’s rapid growth, combined with his launch of *The Jason Lee Show* in 2023, has positioned Jason as a key figure in media and a voice for underrepresented communities. Beyond entertainment, Jason spearheaded *Healthcare Unlocked*, a healthcare initiative designed to provide affordable coverage to one million Americans, reflecting his ability to combine business innovation with meaningful social impact.

In 2024, Jason embarked on his campaign for Stockton City Council’s District 6, a diverse and vibrant community facing challenges such as economic inequality, public safety concerns, and limited access to youth opportunities. Running on a platform of transformative leadership and pragmatic solutions, Jason focused on addressing these issues head-on. His campaign highlighted his commitment to improving public safety, expanding economic opportunities, investing in youth programs, and advocating for affordable housing.

Jason’s message resonated with voters, culminating in a historic victory that reflected District 6’s desire for a leader with both a deep understanding of their struggles and the strategic vision to bring about meaningful change.

Jason’s roots in Stockton give him a unique perspective on the city’s needs. Having grown up in challenging circumstances, he understands the importance of creating opportunities for residents to thrive. His *I Am Ready* initiative, launched in 2023 through his non-profit Hollywood Cares, exemplifies this commitment. By offering internships and workshops for young people, the program fosters skill development and career readiness for Stockton’s next generation.

As a councilmember, Jason is leveraging his extensive experience in labor, media, and business to tackle pressing community issues. His approach emphasizes collaboration, accountability, and actionable solutions to ensure a brighter future for all Stockton residents.

Jason Lee’s election to the Stockton City Council marks a new chapter in his career and a significant moment for District 6. With a focus on delivering tangible results, Jason is committed to improving the quality of life for his constituents while fostering sustainable growth for the city he has long called home.

**Vice Mayor Jason Lee Calls for Urgent Action On Fire Safety Gaps and Port Vulnerability**

STOCKTON, Calif. – Vice Mayor Jason Lee has formally issued a call to action regarding the City of Stockton’s fire preparedness, citing aging infrastructure, hydrant failures, and the lack of a dedicated fire service at the Port of Stockton.

“Our city cannot afford to wait. We have infrastructure failing, hydrants in disrepair, and no fire protection plan for one of our largest economic assets,” said Vice Mayor Lee. “We need immediate solutions.”

**Port of Stockton at Risk**

- The Port lacks a dedicated fire service and currently relies on the City Fire Department—with no reimbursement or formal agreement.
- Vice Mayor Lee raised the issue during City Council meeting, urging formal talks with Port leadership.
- No plan has been presented to date.

**Hydrant Failures Spark New Urgency**

Following the April 4 fire at a South Stockton recycling facility, major issues surfaced:

- Multiple hydrants failed during suppression efforts.
- One hydrant broke and could not be shut off.
- The City identified chronic tampering and aging infrastructure – some hydrants are over 50 years old.

City officials, including the Interim City Manager, Fire Chief, and MUD leadership, have since coordinated to assess the system and explore long-term fixes.

**Immediate Actions Requested**

Vice Mayor Lee has called for:

1. A formal report from the Fire and Municipal Utilities departments.
2. A cost and timeline plan for hydrant repairs and replacements.
3. A fire service strategy for the Port, including a reimbursement model.
4. Review of hydrant audits, tampering reports, and water pressure monitoring.

“This is about public safety, accountability, and making sure our infrastructure doesn’t fail when we need it most,” said Lee.

Fire preparedness and Port protection will be addressed at the next City Council meeting: Tuesday, April 15, 2025, City Council Chambers, 425 N. El Dorado St., 2nd floor, Stockton, CA 95202. The public meeting is scheduled to begin at 5:30 p.m.
