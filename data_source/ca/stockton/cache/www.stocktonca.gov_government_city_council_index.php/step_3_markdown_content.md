City Council Tobacco Retailer/Smoke Shop Moratorium

On Tuesday, March 4, 2025, the Stockton City Council took action, with a unanimous vote of 7-0, approving an urgency ordinance enacting a moratorium on any new, relocation, or physical expansion of tobacco retailer business, also known as smoke shops. The moratorium takes effective immediately for a period of 45-days, while the Council considers what changes are needed to the City’s existing ordinance, such as increasing the distance from sensitive uses like schools, parks, and playgrounds, and potentially establishing a limit on the number of businesses permitted to sell tobacco products. For additional information, please see the [full News Release](https://www.stocktonca.gov/Documents/Community/News%20&%20Information/2025/March/News_2025_03_05_SmokeShopMoratorium.pdf) or call (209) 937-8212.

The Urgency Ordinance (2025-03-04-1509) was extended by action of the City Council on Tuesday, April 15, 2025, to allow for the completion of necessary research, community engagement, interdepartmental coordination, and preparation of permanent regulatory changes. The moratorium has been extended until March 2, 2026.
