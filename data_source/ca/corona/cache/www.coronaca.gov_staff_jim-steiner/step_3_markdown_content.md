# Jim Steiner

Mayor

Jim Steiner was elected to the Corona City Council in November 2018. This was the first election under the City’s change to a By-District voting system, making him the first individual elected to represent residents in District 4.

A resident of Corona for nearly 40 years, Councilman Steiner served as a member of the Corona Fire Department from 1986 when he was a Firefighter Apprentice until his retirement in 2017 as a Ladder Truck Captain. He provided leadership to the department and to the Corona Firefighters’ Association throughout his years of service. In addition to an associate degree and various certifications in Fire Science and Emergency Response, he has completed a certificate program in Leadership and Ethics.

Councilman Steiner has been an active member of the Corona community advocating on behalf of underprivileged kids and children struggling with illness. He feels honored to have been recognized for these efforts to bring awareness and support for community needs. His many recognitions include the Corona Chamber of Commerce “Citizen of the Year,” the American Diabetes Association “Father of the Year,” the Corona-Norco Day of the Child “Champion of Young Children,” a UNITY award for community service, Distinguished Citizen recognition from the YMCA, and recipient of Circle City Kiwanis “2018 Heart of a Hero” award. Jim was also a 2-time Firefighter of the Year with the Corona Fire Department and received the 2015 William “Dallas” Jones Political Leadership award from the California Professional Firefighters. Jim was elected to the Santa Ana College Alumni Hall of Fame in 2020. And most recently, Jim was honored with a “Community Hero” award from the Assistance League Riverside Corona -Norco Branch for his efforts to bring “happiness through music” to students at Orange Grove High School.
