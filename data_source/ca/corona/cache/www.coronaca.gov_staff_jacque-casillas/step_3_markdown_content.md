# Jacque Casillas

Vice Mayor

Jacque Casillas is a dedicated public servant, community advocate, and lifelong resident of Riverside County. A proud first-generation American, Jacque was born and raised in Corona’s historic downtown circle by parents who immigrated from Mexico in pursuit of a better life. She attended local public schools and grew up with a deep appreciation for community, resilience, and the belief that government can—and should—improve people’s lives.

As a councilmember, Jacque has prioritized transparency, accountability, and access. She led the reopening of Griffin Park, established open office hours, launched the city’s first-ever Youth Town Hall, and co-created the committee that laid the groundwork for term limits. Her policy work is grounded in real-life impacts—and a deep commitment to building inclusive systems that serve everyone.

Jacque currently serves as:

· President, Riverside County Division, League of California Cities

· First Vice Chair, Western Riverside Council of Governments (WRCOG)

· Chair, Bedford Coldwater Groundwater Sustainability Authority

· Member, WRCOG Administrative &amp; Finance Committee

· Member, Norco College President’s Advisory Council

She previously served on the CNUSD-Corona Joint Schools Committee, McKinley Grade Separation Ad Hoc Committee, City Council Term Limit Ad Hoc Committee, and the Inland Regional Energy Network of WRCOG.

In addition to her public service, Jacque is a relationship-driven leader who brings heart and humor to her work. She’s a fan of clever wordplay, competitive board games, and trying new foods. Jacque lives in Corona with her husband Zach, their daughter Eleanor, their son Rowen, and their spirited black Labrador, Xiao Mei. She currently serves as Donor Relations Manager for Planned Parenthood of the Pacific Southwest, where she continues her lifelong commitment to equity, access, and self-empowerment.
