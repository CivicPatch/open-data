# Tom Richins

Council Member

Tom Richins was elected in November of 2020 and is currently serving as the first councilman for Corona’s 3rd District.  Arriving in Corona in 2003, it was in 2010 that he purchased the first Mayor’s house on Grand Blvd and became actively involved in Corona’s governmental affairs.

In 2006, Tom and his wife Sunny started their architecture firm specializing in the design of clean rooms, biosafety labs, and general commercial architecture.

After spending a career as superintendent for a large tenant improvement General Contractor based out of Orange County, it was in 2016 that Tom and his business partner established a C-10 licensed electrical construction company.  Both businesses are located in Corona.

Over the years, Tom has developed a passion specifically for Corona’s history.  From 2014-2015 served as the President of the Corona Historic Preservation Society.  Currently writes and preserves Corona’s history through the medium of Facebook’s History of Corona page.

As social media has become more prevalent, Tom was an early member and administrator of the Facebook Group Citizens 4 Corona (C4C), a large group of citizens dedicated to the political activities of the city.

Tom and his wife Sunny have been married for 17 years and are the parents of 3 children.  Upon deciding to run for office, the campaign goals that still remain in place are to bring about the revitalization of the downtown area, assure that developers do not place undue influence on elected officials and the encouragement of the city to be transparent in all things.
