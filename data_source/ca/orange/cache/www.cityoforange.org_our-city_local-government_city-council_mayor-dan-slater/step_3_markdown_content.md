**Term: 2024-2026**

Dan Slater is a third generation Orange resident. In fact, he can trace his family roots in Orange back to the 1880's!  Dan attended Immanuel Lutheran School in Orange from Kindergarten through the 8th grade and graduated from Orange Lutheran High School in 1977.

He received a Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration from Cal State Fullerton in 1985.

His concentration was in finance with an emphasis on real estate. He immediately embarked

on his career of residential real estate brokerage at Orange Realty, Inc., Orange.

Dan Slater is extremely knowledgeable about all of Orange's unique communities and neighborhoods. Dan lives in Old Towne in a 1923 California Bungalow he restored.

Dan's community involvement is extensive and includes eight years on the Orange City Council (1994 – 2002), including serving as the City's Mayor Pro-tem. In 2022 he was elected mayor of Orange.

Dan has been a long-time member of the Orange Rotary Club, served as President of the Old Towne Preservation Association, and President of the Orange Chamber of Commerce. He currently serves on the Measure S Citizen’s Oversight Committee, appointed by the Orange School Board to oversee school bond expenditures.  On Sundays, you will find him ushering at his church, St. John’s Lutheran in downtown Orange.  His dedication to the City of Orange is a testament to practice of Servant Leadership in everyday life. 

Dan is very involved in the "reforestation" of Orange. He is proud of the Tree Hero award from California RE-LEAF and the Orange County Environmental Award.  On two Saturday mornings a month, he is either picking up trash in Santiago Creek or on the 55 freeway.

In his "spare time" he enjoys gardening, skiing, outdoor adventure, tending to his chickens and traveling. Most recent trips include China, South Africa, and Antarctica
