Debra was first elected to the Ontario City Council in December of 2008 after serving the community in various capacities during her 45 years as a resident of Ontario.

As a registered nurse, she understands the importance of community and employee disaster/earthquake preparedness, and she encourages residents and employees to include a 2-week supply of food and water in their home emergency kits.

Debra is active throughout the city. Revitalization of Downtown continues to be important to her as the area is the historic heart of Ontario. Her engagement is reflected in the development of the “Arts and Culture District,” where the city boasts both the “Ontario Museum of History and Art” and the “Chaffey Community Museum of Art.” Downtown has several new restaurants and coffee shops, contributing to its economic activity. The Ontario Ranch area gained a New Stater Brothers shopping center with support retail and specialty restaurants. Also of note is the area around the Toyota Sports Arena. Luxury apartments and retail are currently under construction.  Debra supports helping the unhoused. Ontario has begun construction on the Wellness Campus. This will be a city-owned facility aimed at helping homeless residents by providing them with short-term housing, resources, and mentoring.  And the best news of the year, especially for baseball fans, is that Ontario will host the Dodgers class A team. The new stadium is being built across from Whispering Lakes Golf Course and is set to open in April of 2026. This 190-acre sports park will have a 6000-seat baseball stadium with youth baseball/softball/soccer and football fields.
