Hello HB,

My family arrived here in 1962 and I have always had a genuine love for Huntington Beach. I attended the local public schools including Dwyer and HBHS (Class of 79 ~ let's go Oilers!). I am raising my family here as well. All 3 of my kids attended our public schools. My twins are thriving in our University system (UCSB &amp; UCSC) and my oldest graduated from UCSB and is making a positive impact in the private sector.

I am a Husband (30 years), Father (x3), homeowner, animal lover as well as a guitar enthusiast.  My favorite charity is Big Brothers, Big Sisters and I am a man of Faith. I have decades of Executive Leadership in business and spent over a decade volunteering as a Coach in local youth sports. I have always been active in our city.

Growing up in Huntington Beach I immediately fell in love with our city. Clean air, beautiful beaches, uncrowded wide open spaces, (population ~25,000 in 1962). It's always been the place I knew I wanted to live and raise my family.

Things are changing here in HB, some for the better and some things need oversight. It's these reasons that I want to represent the citizens of Huntington Beach as your Councilman. I will use my decades of executive leadership in business and my genuine love of HB to strategically help guide our city with the will of our residents always in mind.

Previously, I served as the Vice Chairman of the Huntington Beach Planning Commission (appointed by Mayor Pat Burns) and I will strive to earn your respect as a Councilman. I will be accessible by email, phone as well as in person.

I look forward to meeting as many residents as possible.

Sincerely,  
Don Kennedy  
*Huntington Beach City Councilman*
