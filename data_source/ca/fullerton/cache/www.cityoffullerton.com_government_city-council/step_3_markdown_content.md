**About the Fullerton City Council**

The City of Fullerton operates under the council-manager form of local government. The five members of the City Council are elected by the citizens as the legislative, policy-making branch of City government; and the City Manager is appointed by the City Council to implement policy and manage day-to-day operations.

Each year the Council selects one of its members to serve as Mayor and one member to serve as Mayor Pro Tem. The Mayor presides over all Council meetings and is the ceremonial head of the City for official functions.

As Fullerton’s elected representatives, the City Council expresses the values of the electorate in keeping pace with community needs and establishing the quality of municipal services. The Council determines service levels and revenue obligations through the adoption of an annual budget, authorizes City contracts and expenditures, establishes City service and operating policies, and adopts such regulatory measures as may be necessary for the mutual protection of the community.

Regular meetings of the City Council are held on the first and third Tuesdays of each month at 5:30 p.m. in the City Council Chambers at Fullerton City Hall.
