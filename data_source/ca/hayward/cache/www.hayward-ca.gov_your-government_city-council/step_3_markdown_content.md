## City Council

The City Council is responsible for the legislative function of the City, such as reviewing public policies and adopting policies responsive to the community. All of the council members serve at large, which means that each member represents the entire city.

[**Learn More About How Local Government Works ⇒**](https://www.hayward-ca.gov/your-government/how-your-local-government-works)

### The move to district-based elections:

The Hayward City Council gave final approval on October 8, 2024, to legislation moving the City to a geographic district-based system of electing all City Council members except the City’s mayor.

The action established the boundaries of six new Council districts and the sequence of when elections in those districts will take place starting in November 2026. Under the new system, the mayor is the only member of the seven-person Council who will continue to be chosen through at-large, citywide elections.

The first district elections for Hayward Council are scheduled to take place in November 2026 in Districts 1 and 6. Council elections in Districts 2, 3, 4 and 5 are scheduled to take place two years later in November 2028.
