# Bill McReynolds

 

[City Council](https://www.cityofventura.ca.gov/Directory.aspx?DID=74)  
Title: Councilmember - District 5  
[Email](mailto:bmcreynolds@cityofventura.ca.gov)

Bill McReynolds was born in Ohio, while growing up he moved across the country several times with his family. His parents ultimately settled in Southern California. After graduating from Long Beach State Bill started working for several municipalities in Orange County. He worked in the City Manager’s Office, Park &amp; Recreation, Police, Human Resources and Finance departments. Bill left the public sector when presented with an opportunity to work as a homebuilder. Over the years Bill became a leader in the homebuilding industry.  He was recognized as the Homebuilder of the Year in 2019 by the Los Angeles/Ventura Counties chapter of the Building Industry Association and served as President of the chapter in 2022. He also had the privilege to serve on the Board of Directors of VC HOME (Housing Opportunities Made Easier) an affordable housing advocacy non-profit. 

In 2007 Bill had the opportunity to relocate his family to Ventura and never looked back. Once here, Bill jumped into becoming part of the community, starting with becoming a Cub Master and assisting in various youth sports.  As his sons got older, Bill shifted his focus to serving his community at the municipal level.  He has served on the city’s Parks &amp; Recreation Commission, Street Tree Advisory Committee, and the General Plan Advisory Committee. He was elected to serve on Ventura City Council in November 2022.

Bill lives in a house he built with his wife, Megan, and their three sons, Will, Tom, and Matt.
