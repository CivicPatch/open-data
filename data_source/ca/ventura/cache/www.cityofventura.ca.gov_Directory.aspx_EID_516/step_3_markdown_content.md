Title: Councilmember - District 7  
[Email](mailto:amangone@cityofventura.ca.gov)

Alex Mangone is a Ventura native and lifelong resident.  Alex was raised in VUSD public schools, graduated from Buena High School, and attended Ventura Community College. He is a small business owner and President of T&amp;M Machining Inc.

After graduating high school in 1998, Alex attended Ventura Community College to receive his Associate Degree.  Having grown up spending free time after school and summers working in his father’s machine shop, he soon recognized his love and respect for the trade and decided to continue on his father’s legacy as a Mold Maker.  For the past 25 years, his career focus has been on the design, engineering and manufacturing of precision molds and tooling for premier aerospace component and commercial casting manufacturers in the U.S., Canada, Germany, Australia, and India. As an advocate for the small business community, especially those in the trades, Alex has been involved in programs locally the offer trade specific courses, and served on the Technical Advisory Committee for the Center for Employment Training (CET).

He lives in Midtown Ventura with his wife and two children, who also attend VUSD public schools.  His family is active in various charity organizations and regularly volunteer hours for local foundations and non-profits.   Alex and his family are involved in multiple youth sports organizations locally and spend many weekends on the soccer field and in basketball gyms. Alex has been an avid surfer since the age of 10.  In his free time, you’ll find him surfing, enjoying our beaches, and spending time in the ocean with his family.   

As City Councilman for District 7,  Alex is looking forward to representing Midtown residents, along with residents of our beach neighborhoods, including Pierpont, the Keys, and the Harbor.
