### Personal Goal Statement

I believe that municipal government should provide the same value of service I provide to my patients. For me, that means taking a common-sense approach to tackle issues head-on, asking insightful questions, renegotiating bad contracts, and holding our City accountable to all residents and businesses. I am known for doing my homework, listening to people, addressing their concerns, researching the issues, and getting pragmatic results.    

My Priorities Include:

- Advocating for Financial Accountability, Budget Management
- Ensuring a Safe Community
- Mitigating Traffic and Congestion
- Supporting the Growth and Development of Old Town Murrieta
- Advocating for Small Businesses
- Improving the ability to attract new businesses and jobs
- Enhancing Economic Development
- Providing Transparent/Accessible Leadership
- Supporting the community as the effects of COVID-19 continue to impact residents and businesses.
