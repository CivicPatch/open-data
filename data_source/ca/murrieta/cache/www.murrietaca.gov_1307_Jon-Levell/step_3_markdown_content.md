Personal Goal Statement

I have spent most of my adult life here in Murrieta and have watched this amazing city grow over the almost 20 years I have been here. I love the small-town feel and I have also enjoyed the progress that the city has made with development and infrastructure. I look forward to being part of the future growth and prosperity of this city for the residents and businesses that will continue to make this such an amazing place to live. I am happy to represent and serve this community. 

My Priorities Include: 

- Supporting ALL public safety initiatives
- Supporting the growth and development of Murrieta
- Small business support
- Healthcare expansion and growth
- Economic development
- Advocating for Murrieta's progress regarding physical, mental, and spiritual health

### Biography

My wife and I have been married for 15 years and have two amazing daughters and two rescue dogs that fill my household with joy. I am the Director of Business Development for one of the largest employers in the city, Loma Linda University Medical Center-Murrieta, a faith-based, not-for-profit hospital. For the last seven years, my wife and I have been the owners and operators of the longest-running CrossFit in Southwest Riverside County. I served on the Murrieta Planning Commission as a Commissioner and past Chairman, serving a total of four years. Additionally, I sat on the Board of Directors for the Murrieta/Wildomar Chamber of Commerce. 

I look forward to the many great things in store for this amazing city. My hobbies include anything motorcycle related, CrossFit, reading, dogs, and learning new things through adventure and exposure.
