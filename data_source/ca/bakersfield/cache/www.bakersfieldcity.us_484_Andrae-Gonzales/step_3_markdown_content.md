## Biography

Councilman Andrae Gonzales was elected to represent Bakersfield Ward 2 in November 2016. Known as the "Downtown ward," Ward 2 is the most urban, diverse ward in the City of Bakersfield, extending as far as Ming Avenue to the south and Bernard Street at its northern border; and from Mohawk Street to the west and Sterling Road on the east. Born and raised in East Bakersfield, Councilman Gonzales' life has been shaped by a deep commitment to public service and care for others - especially the most vulnerable. He is a proud graduate of East Bakersfield High School and UC Berkeley. In 2023 he was elected by his City Council colleagues to serve as the City's Vice Mayor, the first Latino to serve in that capacity in Bakersfield's history.

Before his election to the Bakersfield City Council, Councilman Gonzales served as a trustee on the Bakersfield City School District Board of Education (December 2010 to December 2016), the largest elementary school district in the State of California, with more than 30,000 students.

## Focus as Councilman

As a Councilman, Mr. Gonzales has focused on:

- Completing the Thomas Roads Improvement Projects
- Revitalizing Downtown Bakersfield and Old Town Kern
- Reducing homelessness in a systematic way
- Preserving Bakersfield's historic neighborhoods
- Improving the quality of life for residents throughout the City of Bakersfield

He currently serves as Chairman of the City Council's Budget and Finance Committee; is a member of the Legislative and Litigation Committee; is a member of the Water Resources Committee; and is the Chairman of the Housing &amp; Homelessness Committee.

## Community Involvement

Beyond his role as a Bakersfield City Councilman, Mr. Gonzales is deeply involved in community change through nonprofit organizations. Since 2010, he has served as: 

- The CEO of Stewards, a Bakersfield-based nonprofit
- The founder of four Kern County-based nonprofit organizations and collaboratives: 
  
  - Faith in Action Kern County (2006)
  - Children First (2010)
  - Kern Alliance of Nonprofits (2016)
  - Hub of Bakersfield (2018)

He has also served as the Chairman of the Tree Foundation of Bakersfield; as a board member of Bike Bakersfield; as a board member of the Kern County Black Chamber of Commerce; and as a board member of the Kern Council of Governments. While the City Councilmember position is not a full-time job, Andrae is happy to work nearly full-time hours to address the challenges and meet the hopes of a growing city. He welcomes the opportunity to talk with community members. Feel free to contact him on his personal cell phone at 661-808-4929.
