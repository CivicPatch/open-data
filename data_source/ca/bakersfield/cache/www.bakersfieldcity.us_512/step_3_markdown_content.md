## Biography

Born and raised in Ward 7, Manpreet Kaur is proud to call Bakersfield her hometown. Her parents immigrated to the United States from Punjab, India. She was born at Kern Medical Hospital and attended Greenfield and Panama Buena Vista Union School Districts. Manpreet graduated from Ridgeview High School where she was an active community member as the Student Body President, member of Ford Dimension DreamBuilders, and Latina Leaders of Kern County. After high school, Manpreet went on to obtain her Bachelor’s degree in Political Science and minor in Law and Society from UC San Diego. Manpreet earned two Master’s degrees from the University of Wisconsin- Madison: one in Urban and Regional Planning and one in Public Affairs.

In 2016, Manpreet founded the Kern County chapter of Jakara Movement, a youth leadership development organization focused on the health and wellness of the Punjabi Sikh population anchored in California’s Central Valley. The organization educates Sikh youth about their heritage, explores challenges facing them like gender equality, and prepares them to be leaders in their communities. Today the organization has 70 registered high school clubs and 25 college chapters spanning 15 California counties.

Manpreet was appointed to serve on the [Keep Bakersfield Beautiful Committee](https://www.bakersfieldcity.us/426) and appointed by the Kern County Board of Supervisors to serve on the Early Childhood Council of Kern. She also serves on the ABC 23 Community Advisory Board. A few years back, Manpreet was honored to be awarded Bakersfield Life Magazine’s 20 under 40 People to watch.

In November 2022, Manpreet became the first Sikh Punjabi woman elected to the Bakersfield City Council.
