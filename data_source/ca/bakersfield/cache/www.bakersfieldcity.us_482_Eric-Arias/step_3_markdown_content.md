## Biography

Councilmember Eric Arias was elected in November 2020 to serve Ward 1, Southeast Bakersfield. Ward 1 includes the culturally diverse communities of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Casa Loma, Southgate and parts of Greenfield. 

Eric was born and raised in Bakersfield where his Veteran father instilled the value of service and hard work. Working in the family’s party rentals business, retail jobs, and delivering pizzas, Eric saved for college. After attending local public schools, he balanced several jobs, paying his way to graduate from UC Santa Barbara. 

After college, Eric put his education and experience to work by serving the community. Since 2014, Eric has served our community through the offices of County Supervisor Leticia Perez and State Assemblyman Rudy Salas as a field staffer. As a Councilman, Eric has prioritized fighting for the challenges facing hard-working families in Ward 1. Eric brings real life experience and understanding of issues critical to our community, such as jobs, fair pay for essential workers, and public health and safety. 

Beyond his role on the City Council, Eric spends his free time volunteering for Leaders in Life, a local youth leadership mentorship program, and We the People, a civics education program that teaches high school students about the importance of public service and civic engagement. Councilmember Arias proudly calls Southeast Bakersfield his home and is honored to represent the hardworking residents of Bakersfield City Council Ward 1.
