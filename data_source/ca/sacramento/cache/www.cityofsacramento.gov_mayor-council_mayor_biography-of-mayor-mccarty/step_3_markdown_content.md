Kevin McCarty was elected as the 57th Mayor of the City of Sacramento in November 2024.

From 2014 to 2024, McCarty served in the State Legislature, representing the 6th Assembly District, which includes the majority of the City of Sacramento.

McCarty served as Chair of the Assembly Public Safety Committee, working to combat some of the state’s most pressing public safety issues, such as retail theft, gun violence, and drug abuse. In addition, McCarty served as the Chair of the Assembly Budget Subcommittee on Education Finance, overseeing historic increases in public education and expanding college access and affordability.

As an Assemblymember, McCarty authored over 90 measures that became law, including the Universal Preschool Act, the American River Parkway Conservancy Act, Independent Investigations in Police Shootings, HOPE California – Drug Treatment for Repeat Felons, Voting Rights for Formerly Incarcerated, and the High School Financial Literacy Act.

A lifelong Sacramentan, McCarty began his career as a Housing and Redevelopment Commissioner and then served on the Sacramento City Council for a decade.

After receiving his high school diploma through adult education, he attended American River Community College and earned degrees from CSU Long Beach and CSU Sacramento. McCarty and his wife Leticia live in Sacramento with their twin daughters Victoria and Barbara.
