![Hector Sosa](https://www.downeyca.org/home/showpublishedimage/4813/638061981793070000)Hector Sosa is a leader, problem-solver, and community volunteer who has built a reputation for advocating for Downey and always doing what is right. For over 15 years, he dedicated his time as a coach and board member for the West Downey Little League and Downey Junior Athletic Association. He is the immediate past President for Gangs Out of Downey and the President-Elect for the Downey Los Amigos Kiwanis. Having served in various community organizations, he understands the true meaning of volunteerism and how collective efforts can bring a magnitude of change for the better. He feels that volunteering is not only a responsibility but an obligation. It serves as a way to give back to the city that has given so much to its residents and it is our moral responsibility to pay it forward to the next generation of stakeholders. 

Hector was born in Los Angeles to immigrant parents from Mexico and Peru who came to the US in search of the American Dream. He moved to Downey during middle school and has been a resident of his much loved city for over 37 years. He is a product of our excellent Downey Unified School District, and while at Warren High School, he met his high school sweetheart, Daisy. They have been married for 24 years and have two teenage boys, Lucas and Joshua. 

Hector graduated from Cal State University Los Angeles, earning a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration with an emphasis in Finance and a minor in Economics. As a Financial Services Professional with New York Life, he works with clients daily to help ensure their financial future and provide peace of mind.

Hector is known for being soft-spoken and even-keeled, but behind that quiet demeanor stands a man who is determined to do what is best for his city and its residents. His initiatives while serving on the city council are:

- Bring back stability to City Hall by recruiting and maintaining the most qualified and professional city staff.

<!--THE END-->

- Implement solutions to assist the homeless with compassion and effectiveness.

<!--THE END-->

- Address the rising crime rates in our city by working with the Downey Police Department and other elected officials at all government levels.

<!--THE END-->

- Identity measures to reduce the rising rates of speeding occurring citywide.

<!--THE END-->

- Create support for small businesses.

<!--THE END-->

- Ensure equitable access of its fields at city parks for Downey youth sports programs.

<!--THE END-->

- Continue to work collaboratively with the Downey Unified School District to build strong strategic partnerships to ensure the most optimal opportunities for our city's youth.
