## Council Districts

The City of Downey is divided into five Districts, with District 5 containing the entire geographical area of the City.

On April 12, 2022, the City Council adopted a new district map as part of the [2021 Redistricting process.](https://www.downeyca.org/residents/downey-redistricting-2021) under Elec. Code 21626(b), new district boundaries do not start to apply to Council seats until their terms naturally expire and are up for regular election for a new four-year term.  District 2 and 4 seats naturally expire in November 2022, and the new boundaries will start to apply to those districts at that upcoming regular election.  District 1, 3, and 5 seats naturally expire in November 2024, and the new boundaries will start to apply to those districts at that upcoming regular election.  

 To view the **OLD** District map (which remain in effect until the next regular elections as stated above) and to see which City Council District you live in, view [this interactive map.](https://downeyca.maps.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?webmap=a9abfef5cef64d06964535805077ad02)
