![DSC_0556_ppWebSmall](https://www.downeyca.org/home/showpublishedimage/5640/638380511133300000)

Dorothy Pemberton is a lifelong resident who has been involved in the City for over 30 years. She holds a Broker Associate license and has been with Century 21 Peak in Downey for 16 years. Dorothy has been a member of the Greater Downey Association of Realtors for over 30 years and focuses on residential sales. She is also a Notary Public working out of the same office. Her background also includes work in the fields of accounting and property management. Twenty years ago, Dorothy returned to college to obtain a bachelor’s degree in Liberal Arts, along with a Teaching Credential. She obtained her master’s degree in Educational Technology from California State University Long Beach. Upon graduation, she became a substitute teacher for

the Downey Unified School District. This is something she enjoys to this day.

**Community Involvement**

Dorothy’s community involvement began in the mid-1980s when she joined Soroptimist International of Downey. This lit a fuse to expanding her volunteerism. Since then, she has been involved in many organizations and non-profits within Downey.

- The Downey YMCA (past Chairman of the Board)
- Gangs Out of Downey (GOOD) (past Board member)
- Assistance League of Downey
- Downey Symphonic Society
- San Antonio Guild of Childrens Hospital Los Angeles
- Downey Ponytail Softball Association (past Board member and Treasurer)
- Habitat for Humanity (building the 1st Downey Home)
- President and/or Chairman of various PTAs – Kirkwood, Rio Hondo, Griffiths and Warren
- President of Downey Council PTA
- Director of the Downey Council PTA H.E.L.P.S. Food Pantry

Dorothy takes pride in having led the initiative to construct a dedicated snack shack for Downey Ponytail Softball. This building, located at Independence Park, is an asset to the park and community at large as it is a source of funds for the league’s sustainability.

**Committees and Commissions**

Dorothy was appointed by four different City Council members to serve the City in many capacities.

- Public Works Committee Member (Vice-Chair 2023)
- Parks and Recreation Commission
- Citizens Oversight Committee for Measure S (the $50 million bond measure to improve our parks and fire stations.)

She was also selected to serve on the Downey Unified School District Measure O Bond Committee. This bond funded improvements for our aging schools which created state of the art learning centers.

Dorothy is a two-time graduate of the Downey Police Department’s Citizens Academy. This experience enabled her to remain current by experiencing first-hand the intricate workings and challenges facing our Downey Police Department. Her commitment to law enforcement is lifelong and unwavering. As an active member of Gangs Out of Downey (GOOD), she continues to support organizations which assist local law enforcement both in the community and in our schools.

**Goals**

Downey has seen many changes over Dorothy’s lifetime. Both the community as a whole and its residents should benefit from these changes.

- Community Safety – Focusing on hiring more officers, continuing to offer incentive programs and collaborating with the Police Chief on ways to deter crime.
- Homelessness – Collaborating with the City and County to provide outreach, resources and programs for the homeless who may also be mentally ill or have substance abuse problems. Keeping our neighborhoods safe is a priority.
- Quality of Life – Return to a proactive Code Enforcement Department. Hire more staff if necessary. Develop a dog park and a community garden in District 3.
- Fiscal Responsibility – Maintain our strong and balanced budget and keep departments accountable. Save and/or cut costs whenever possible.
- Economic Development – City Hall should be more business friendly. We should also attract businesses that offer a variety of goods and services as well as an array of different types of restaurants. Bringing in more family-friendly businesses which offer activities for teens and youth is another goal. All of these new businesses must also be a good fit in the neighborhood.

**Family**

Dorothy’s parents immigrated to the United States from Germany after the war in the 1940s. Her Lithuanian mother and Romanian father made her a first generation American. Both parents were very proud of their new life in the U.S. Her father worked for General Motors in South Gate while her mother was a homemaker. Dorothy grew up in south Downey, graduated from Downey High and attended Cerritos College, where she obtained an Associate Degree in Computer Programming.

When Dorothy’s mother became a single parent, Dorothy took several jobs in high school to help with household expenses. This is where she learned that having faith, never giving up and working hard for causes she believes in would serve her well in life.

Dorothy’s two greatest accomplishments in life are the raising of her daughters Shelby and Whitney with her former husband of over 30 years. Shelby is a UCLA graduate and Whitney is a graduate of UCSB. She is very proud of their successes thus far.

Dorothy is looking forward to continuing an active and involved life in Downey by serving the residents of District 3 as their councilwoman.
