## How is Elk Grove Run?

Elk Grove is a general law city under California law with five elected representatives on the City Council, the mayor and four council members. The office of the elective mayor is decided by the voters, with the position elected citywide (at-large), having a residency requirement within the City limits, and serves a two-year term. There are four council residency districts. Council members are elected by district (elected by voters of the district alone) and serve four-year terms. Each council member must reside within the district of the city that they oversee.

The City Council is the legislative body of Elk Grove. It has a broad range of municipal powers including the review and approval of an annual budget, establishing community goals and objectives, approving the City's general plan and proposed sphere of influence, reviewing and approving major projects and hearing community problems and concerns.
