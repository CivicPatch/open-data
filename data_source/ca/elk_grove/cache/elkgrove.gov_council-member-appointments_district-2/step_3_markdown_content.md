Rod Brewer, a longtime active member in the community, was elected to the Elk Grove City Council in November 2022. Rod, an Elk Grove resident and homeowner since 1997, holds a B.A. in Political Science â Public Service from the University of California, Davis. Rod brings over a decade of experience as a high-level staff person for elected leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives and the California State Legislature. Currently, Rod is a Government Relations Advisor for Southern California Edison.

Before joining the City Council, Rod was elected to the Cosumnes Community Services District (CCSD) Board of Directors in 2010 and re-elected to second and third terms in 2014 and 2018. As a CCSD Director, Rod worked closely with leadership to establish policies and balance multi-million-dollar budgets that allowed CCSD to keep people safe, generate new streams of revenue, and effectively serve Elk Grove and Galt through the Great Recession and, most recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic. He led efforts to ensure the development of Elk Grove's network of parks including the soon-to-be-constructed Morse Park Community Center, the CORE, and CCSD's full ownership of Elk Grove Regional Park.

In 2013, Rod, along with a broad collection of community leaders, successfully brought back All-American Soap Box Derby racing in Elk Grove after a 25+ year hiatus where local youth and youth from other parts of California competed. It helped to foster and broaden the benefits of STEAM learning and allowed Rod and his colleagues to develop a new generation of soap box derby racing enthusiasts who went on to compete in Akron, Ohio, home of the All-American Soap Box Derby World Championships for several years.

Rod has been, and continues to be, a strong supporter of our local public safety and our business community. Rod's support for working families and his compassion for helping those in need is consistent based on his values and his past service as a member of the Elk Grove Food Bank Board of Directors (2009-2011) and as a City-appointed member to the Human Rights/Fair Housing Commission advisory board (2009-2013).
