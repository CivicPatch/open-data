![](https://www.costamesaca.gov/home/showpublishedimage/18194/637789805565630000)In November of 2022, Andrea Marr was re-elected to Costa Mesa's District 3 for a second four-year term.

First elected in November of 2018, Marr was part of the City of Costa Mesa’s historical first District Elections and became the first person elected to represent Costa Mesa City Council District 3.

In 2021, she was voted by her Council colleagues to be Mayor Pro-Tem.

Prior to being elected to the City Council, Andrea served on the city’s Cultural Art Committee, where she helped spearhead a number of different community art projects and events. She has also previously served on the Bikeway and Walkability Committee.

Andrea was born in Northern California and moved to Rome, Italy at the age of 7, where she lived for a decade and developed a love for travel and international cultures.

Andrea is a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy of which she was nominated to attend by Vice President Al Gore. During her time at the Academy, she held multiple leadership positions and competed with the Academy Karate team. She was recognized for her leadership by the Naval Academy Superintendent and graduated with a degree in Aerospace Engineering.

Upon graduation, she reported to USS Princeton, a guided missile cruiser, where she served as the Gunnery and Ordinance Officer on two deployments. After completing her first tour, she attended Navy schools in South Carolina and New York to complete qualification as a nuclear engineer. She subsequently served aboard USS Nimitz, a nuclear aircraft carrier. On Nimitz, she led a division of 20 nuclear trained machinist mates for two years, including a 10-month deployment to the Persian Gulf.

After completing her commitment to the Navy, Andrea traveled to Nicaragua, the birthplace of her mother, to learn more about her heritage and volunteer with a local non-profit that installed solar panels and small hydroelectric plants. After six months in Nicaragua, she returned to the United States to work for an energy efficiency company in Seattle. Eager to move back to Southern California, Andrea moved to Costa Mesa in 2012 when her company expanded their Irvine office.

Andrea also holds an M.S. in Engineering Management from Old Dominion University. Her final coursework focused on the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building program. She was a 2013 recipient of the White House Champion of Change award for her work in energy as a veteran. She is a licensed professional engineer in the state of Washington and is a Director at Willdan Group, a publicly traded energy solutions company.

Andrea lives in Costa Mesa with her husband Scott and their Goldendoodle, Lincoln.
