Steve Lustro has been a resident of Pomona since 1982. He grew up in Monterey Park, attending Repetto Elementary and Mark Keppel High School. Steve’s interest in his neighborhood and community was evident when, at nine years of age, he wrote to City Hall and asked that additional streetlights be installed on his block and that “stop” signs be erected at a nearby intersection for increased safety. The City found the requests to be warranted and both requests were honored. Steve’s first foray into public service was as a two-year member of the Monterey Park Youth Commission while he was in high school.

After being involved in various aspects of running a small, family-owned building maintenance business for nearly a decade, Steve made a life-changing decision to pursue a longtime passion – Urban and Regional Planning – at Cal Poly Pomona. Upon graduation, Steve joined the Community Development Department staff at the City of Claremont, first as the City’s sole Code Enforcement Officer and then in progressively more responsible positions in the Planning Division. In 2000, he pursued a promotional opportunity as City Planner in the City of Montclair. Seven years later, Steve was promoted to Director of Community Development, overseeing the Planning, Building, and Code Enforcement functions of the City. After nearly 25 years of public service, Steve retired in April 2016.

Steve has been married to Sharon Weltmer Lustro since January 1983. Sharon grew up in Honolulu, Long Beach, and Fullerton and is an alumna of Cal State Fullerton's Business program. Before retiring in 2019, she taught English as a Second Language and citizenship preparation classes at Chino Valley Adult School. Steve and Sharon are the proud parents of two adult children, both products of Pomona schools and UC Berkeley. Olivia is a virtual care supervisor at Kaiser Permanente, and Drew is a product engineer with AngelList.
