Greg Ritchie was elected to the Vacaville City Council on June 8, 2021. On November 8, 2022, he was re-elected to fulfill a 4-year term. He was appointed as Vice Mayor on January 9, 2024.

He was born and raised in Vacaville. He attended elementary, middle, and high school in Vacaville where he developed lifelong friendships. His participation in athletics taught him that hard work, pursuing constructive goals, and striving to attain positive end results are paramount in life.

His real estate financial career began immediately following graduation from California State University Long Beach where he majored in Business &amp; Sociology. He met his wife Melissa while in the Los Angeles area, and returned to Vacaville to open his own mortgage brokerage in downtown Vacaville in 2012. The mortgage brokerage company, Citizen's Financial, now includes three locations. His company strives to make home ownership possible for all California residents, and it has a unique focus on working with public safety providers, educators, healthcare professionals, and members of the US armed service.

In his spare time, he serves as a Board member for Kairos Public Schools, volunteers with the Vacaville Veterans Hall American Legion Post 165, and enjoys coaching youth sports for his 2 children Joslyn and Jadon. As a small business owner, he supports and understands the needs of the Vacaville business community. As a life-long resident, he knows that promoting public safety and community connectivity is essential for Vacaville's growth.
