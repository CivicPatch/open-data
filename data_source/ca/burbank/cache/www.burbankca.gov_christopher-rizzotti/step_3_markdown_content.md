# Christopher John Rizzotti, Council Member

Christopher John Rizzotti is a lifelong Burbank resident who has built a strong business in the city he loves. With a passionate desire to serve his community, Chris was appointed to the Burbank City Planning Board in 2013 and was elected to the Burbank City Council in November 2024.     
​  
​As a witness to Burbank’s transformation from the aviation hub of the world to the world’s media capital, Chris understands the importance of honoring the City’s past while embracing the future. 

For more than a decade, Chris formed countless relationships with members of the greater Burbank community as a committed broker and owner of Rizzotti Real Estate. Named Realtor of the Year by the Burbank Association of Realtors in 2013 and President of the Association’s Community Service Foundation, Chris was also elected Association President in 2012 and Vice-President in 2011.

Close to his heart as an entrepreneur himself, Chris has a tremendous passion for small business ownership and development and spends much of his time giving back and guiding peers. His tireless commitment to service was recognized early in his career when Chris worked as a licensed insurance broker. He received the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Outstanding Achievement Award and was named Affiliate of the Year by the Latin American Insurance Agents Association.

Dedication to his profession is matched only by his devotion to the Burbank community. Chris has long championed issues of civic, social, and personal importance to him.

Chris continues to serve on the boards and committees of various non-profits and organizations including the CSF Burbank Bike Angels, Burbank Airport Study Group, Burbank YMCA, Burbank Disaster Council, Burbank Police Foundation, Family Promise, Burbank Charter Review Committee Chair, Providence Saint Joseph’s Medical Center, and McCambridge Park War Memorial.  Chris also graduated in 2009 from Leadership Burbank.
