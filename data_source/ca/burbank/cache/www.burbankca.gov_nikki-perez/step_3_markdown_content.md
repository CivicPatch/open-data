# Nikki Perez, Mayor

Nikki was born &amp; raised in Burbank and has always been passionate about serving her community - from her very first job as a City of Burbank CREST worker, to Chair of the Burbank Library Board of Trustees, all the way to Mayor of her hometown.

She was raised by parents who immigrated to Burbank from El Salvador and Guatemala and is a product of our local BUSD schools. She received her B.A. In Psychology and  B.A. in Music Performance from UC Riverside and a Master of Social Welfare from the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs. In 2022, She was elected with a record breaking 17,958 votes becoming the first indigenous (k'iche') and openly LGBTQIA+ Council Member in the City of Burbank. Today she serves as the youngest Mayor in our City's history.   
   
As a Social Worker, Nikki has dedicated her career to public service and advocacy for vulnerable populations. Currently, she serves as an Associate Clinical Social Worker with youth and families and most recently worked as the Program Manager for Kids First, a City of Los Angeles program that she developed to bring nonprofit, government, and LAUSD partners together in order to increase academic success for unhoused students in the San Fernando Valley. She has also served as a Communications Director in the State Assembly and as an Education &amp; Workforce Development Coordinator with the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce.  
   
You can find Nikki around town on a walk with her husband and their dog, or enjoying a cup of coffee in Magnolia Park. She looks forward to grabbing a cup of coffee and discussing how we can all work together to keep the beautiful city we love while building the future we deserve!
