# Zizette Mullins, Council Member

## Zizette Mullins

Zizette Mullins embarked on her notable career with the City of Glendale, dedicating 25 years to its growth and development. In 2012, she was unanimously appointed to the role of City Clerk for the City of Burbank, subsequently she was elected by majority vote during the 2013 Municipal Election. Her decade-long service as City Clerk was marked by achievements such as earning the Certified Municipal Clerk (2014) and Master Municipal Clerk Certifications (2016), and she played a pivotal role in enhancing record-keeping systems, successfully conducted ten Municipal Elections, and launching a successful Passport program, among other modernizations.

In November 2022, Mullins made a significant career move by joining the Burbank City Council, post-retirement as City Clerk. Leveraging her vast experience in government, community relations, economic initiatives, and fiscal management, she has been influential in shaping effective policies for Burbank. Her community involvement is extensive, including participation in the Domestic Violence Task Force, the Advisory Board of Home Again L.A., and the Burbank Committee for the Providence St. Joseph’s Hospital Minutes Matter Emergency Services Campaign. Her recent appointment to the 2023 Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) Economic and Community Development Committee highlights her influence in regional matters.

A Burbank resident for over four decades and a former downtown Burbank business owner, Mullins possesses a deep understanding of both residential and commercial perspectives. A graduate of the Burbank Leadership Class of 2013, she actively mentors young professionals and was recognized as the Humanitarian of Year by the City Clerk’s Association in 2016 for her efforts.

Mullins holds a Bachelor's degree in Business Management. Her family life is enriched by her marriage to Michael Mullins, their three children – two of whom are alumni of Burbank schools - and the joy of six grandchildren.
