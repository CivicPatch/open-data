### Career/Experience

Jessica started her military service at just 18 years old, and soon found her future taking shape. She served as a Staff Sergeant in the United States Marine Corps stationed around the globe, and worked in various Military Occupational Specialties (MOS) to include Ammunition Technician in Japan, and U.S. Embassy Marine Security Guard in New Delhi, India and Madrid, Spain. While serving, she was chosen to work detail for the President of the United States during both the Bush and Clinton Administrations. She was also selected to work detail for Former Secretary of State Colin Powell, while in Jerusalem, Israel. 

Among Jessica’s accomplishments is her time on the New York City Police Department (NYPD).  She served in Brooklyn, NY, as a motorcycle officer and also worked within the inner city areas as a part of the Quality of Life Team, serving small businesses and residents.

Her life and service took her around the globe from New York to Michigan, Japan, New Delhi, India, Madrid, Spain, Massachusetts, California, Virginia and back to her current home in Temecula. These worldly experiences have given Jessica respect for other cultures and love for diversity that continues to influence her decisions today.

### Community Service

Volunteering in the community is a passion of Jessica’s -- it is an activity that the entire Alexander family often participates in, with heart for Temecula.  

Jessica’s long history of community service also includes international experiences that provide valuable perspective and insight.  While serving in New Deli, India, Jessica volunteered her time assisting with a local medical aid team to provide health services to underprivileged children.  In Mexico, Jessica participated in constructing homes for disadvantaged families.

Jessica organized “Purses for Women,” a homeless outreach effort that focused on helping to meet the needs of many by providing everyday necessities that others may take for granted such as, food, personal hygiene items, socks, gloves, scarves, etc.  Jessica also enjoys working with children and young adults. She volunteered as a counselor at a camp for young adults with Down Syndrome and has worked for several years as a certified Soccer Coach. Some of her other interactions with youth involve working with CAB, a Rehabilitation house for Adolescence, while living in Boston, Massachusetts.

Jessica and her husband are active members of their church.

### Occupation

Jessica had often hoped to serve in a life affirming ministry; a hope that was fulfilled in Birth Choice of Temecula where she began as a volunteer Care Coach Advocate.  She has since taken on the position as Center Director for Birth Choice.  Her responsibilities support her strong desire to serve others; and she often organizes groups of volunteers to help with various needs for the community.
