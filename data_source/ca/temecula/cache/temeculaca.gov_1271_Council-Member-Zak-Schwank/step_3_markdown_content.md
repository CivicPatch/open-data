# Council Member Zak Schwank

Zak Schwank has lived in Temecula with his wife and children since 2001. Zak has served on School Site Council at Paloma Elementary School and on the PTA Executive Board at Temecula Elementary School. Zak was appointed to the City of Temecula Community Services Commission in 2013 and served as Chairperson from 2015-2018. He was first elected in 2018, re-elected in 2022 and is currently serving his second term on the Temecula City Council. 

Since moving to Temecula, Zak has tirelessly worked for Temecula families. In 2011, he launched Temecula Bike Train. This organization began as a desire for a program that educated families about cycling and empowered them to choose a bicycle for transportation. Temecula Bike Train started with Paloma Elementary and has grown to include programs at Barnett Elementary and Temecula Elementary. Over the years Zak has partnered with the City of Temecula, The Bike Shop Temecula, and various other agencies and groups to provide education and insight into safely biking to school and work. With the support of many dedicated and knowledgeable community members, Temecula Bike Train has been able to donate more than 50 new and used bikes to children and adults in Temecula. 

Having started a family in Temecula, Zak is aware of the impact a safe and positive environment has on families. Through his work within the community, Zak sees firsthand the benefits families gain from parks, community theater, museums, classes, and activities offered by the City of Temecula. As a Council Member, Zak will focus on the positive quality of life and family values that make Temecula an exceptional place to live, work, and play.
