# Mayor Brenden Kalfus

Mayor Brenden Kalfus is a home-grown Temeculan. He was born here in 1991, attended Hillcrest Academy for Kindergarten through 7th Grade, Vail Ranch Middle School for 8th Grade, and graduated from Temecula Valley High School in 2009. Brenden met his wife, Mia, in 2005 at Temecula Valley High, where she played softball and he played baseball. After graduating from TVHS, Brenden earned a baseball scholarship to attend Saint Mary’s College of California in the City of Moraga. While at Saint Mary’s he earned many accolades including an Academic All-American, West Coast Conference 36-Game Hit Streak Record holder, 2013 WCC Batting Title Winner and First-Team All WCC multiple times. In 2013, he graduated from Saint Mary’s with a Bachelor’s Degree in Kinesiology. A few weeks after graduation, he was selected in the 2013 Major League Baseball Draft by the Toronto Blue Jays. After his baseball career came to an end in 2015, he set his sights on the dream of moving back to Temecula, starting a family and chasing after new passions.

Brenden pursued his firefighting career, while growing his family.  In five years, he went from engaged and attending a basic fire academy to five children, married, and the youngest Arson Investigator in the City of Anaheim.  It began in 2015, when Brenden attended San Pasqual Reservation Fire Academy where he graduated at the top of his class, earning the “Top Rung” honors. He worked as an EMT throughout Los Angeles and Orange County before being hired as a Police Officer / Firefighter for the City of Sunnyvale in Northern California, where he would relocate his family for a short time. Brenden attended the 160th class of Alameda County Sheriff’s Office Police Academy. After a grueling 6+ month police academy, he put in the hard work while adding another baby to the family, to again graduate top of his class and receive the award of “Top Cop.” After working for the City of Sunnyvale for approximately 1 year, Brenden put his family first and took a job opportunity to move back to Temecula and work for the City of Anaheim as a firefighter. Brenden is currently working as a dual-specialty firefighter (Paramedic and Arson Investigator).

Brenden calls Temecula home with his wife, Mia, and their 5 children. Throughout the last three decades, he has seen the major changes and growth this City has gone through and knows first-hand how truly special Temecula is.  He grew up playing at Ronald Reagan Sports Park down the street from his house, and now has the opportunity to spend his weekends watching his children play at that same ballpark.  

Brenden knows Temecula is an amazing and unique City to call home for his family, and wants every family here to be able to experience all that Temecula has to offer.  He has always put in the hard work and dedication to create the best life for his family, and he will not accept anything less for his community. As Mayor Member, Brenden will focus on pursuing the highest possible quality of life for the community members, by ensuring Temecula remains a safe, family oriented community.
