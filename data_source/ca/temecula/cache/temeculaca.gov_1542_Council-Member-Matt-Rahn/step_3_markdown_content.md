# Council Member Matt Rahn

Dr. Matt Rahn has over twenty years’ experience in higher education and university research, and as a wildfire, public health, land use, energy, and policy professional. He received his Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees from the University of Nevada Reno, his Ph.D. from UC Davis, and his law degree from the University of San Diego. Throughout his career he has tackled some of the most fundamental issues facing our region, including public safety, wildfires, transportation, renewable energy, agriculture, housing, homelessness, mental/behavioral health, community resilience, agriculture, water quality, water management, habitat conservation, and open space. Matt has a unique background that brings a valuable perspective and insight to the City of Temecula. 

Matt began working in the City of Temecula in early 2000, ultimately engaging in some of the largest most consequential projects in our region. Over the past twenty years, Matt was able to witness the amazing transformation and growth of the City. He fell in love with the City of Temecula… not just because of the beauty of the region, but the passion, dedication, and pride that our residents have. 

In 2005, he began representing San Diego State University in alliance with the City of Temecula, in the long seven-year battle over the Liberty Quarry. He has also worked on projects that have vastly improved our local infrastructure, decreased traffic, increased our regional energy independence, improved our air quality, improved law enforcement and fire protection, increased community resilience, improved our local economy, advanced public health and wellbeing, and enriched our overall quality of life. 

Key issues for Mayor Rahn include public safety, economic growth and recovery, local jobs and businesses, transportation/traffic, parks and recreation, and our overall quality of life. He firmly believes that our City’s ability to attract, grow, and keep vibrant businesses is essential to our future. This can be accomplished by ensuring a “business-friendly” environment and a high quality of life that is attractive to both businesses and employees. It is important to continue the City’s legacy of a safe and healthy community, by pursuing responsible and thoughtful growth opportunities that continue to make Temecula a premier California City. 

As a representative on the Temecula City Council, he works tirelessly to ensure that Temecula preserves and carefully plans its future, providing the guidance that continues to make our City great. In just his first eight years, Matt has led the charge on developing a Senior Master Plan for our City, led a successful investment of over $100 million in the I-15 corridor, developed higher education facilities and new opportunities to the community, facilitated regional communication and cooperation on energy, air quality, and water issues, and developed community-based programs to improve public safety. 

Matt Rahn strongly believes that a good council member must be a great public servant: fair, transparent, and accessible. Matt is always available to discuss any questions, concerns, ideas, or opportunities.
