# About District 7

I am proud to serve as your representative, following my journey from immigrating to the U.S. with my family in 1975. The generosity of our community inspired me to dedicate my life to public service. For 27 years, I‚Äôve worked as a firefighter, including 21 years with the San Jose Fire Department, where I became the first Vietnamese Fire Captain. As a lifelong member of our community, I‚Äôm committed to ensuring our District is safer, cleaner, and stronger for everyone. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†

I‚Äôm truly honored to have been in the presence of our nation‚Äôs heroes, the veterans, here at the Autorama Event. Your unwavering courage, selfless sacrifice, and dedication to our country continue to inspire and uplift us every single day. It was a profound privilege to contribute to this meaningful occasion with a UA60 flyover, serving as a small but heartfelt tribute to the brave men and women who have given so much in service to our freedom. ‚ú®

Vesak 2025 Cultural Festival at History Park!

Today during the City Council meeting, I was verbally attacked by Hanh-Giao Nguyen, a council staff member, while delivering a proclamation honoring displaced Vietnamese Americans and celebrating our achievements in our new city and country. I spoke about my family being forced from Vietnam because of communism. I spoke about coming to America, the land of the free, where I was given the opportunity to rebuild in a democratic republic and serve my community. Vietnamese Americans have shaped San Jose‚Äôs cultural, economic, and civic fabric in so many ways. We are business owners, artists, educators, public servants, community leaders, and so much more. Today‚Äôs proclamation was not about the fall of Saigon. It was about honoring the strength and perseverance of a people displaced from their homes with nothing but the clothes on their backs. Despite the challenges they faced, they overcame tremendous obstacles to contribute to and enrich the greatest nation on Earth. Hanh-Giao Nguyen repeatedly stated, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt celebrate‚Ä¶‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou are a disgrace‚Ä¶‚Äù while simultaneously recording her outburst on her phone. Her actions disrupted the dignity of the moment and disrespected not only the council proceedings, but also the broader Vietnamese-American community in San Jose. I have asked the San Jose City Manager to address this situation appropriately. I will present a Black April commendation, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon on April 29th, 2025 during the city council meeting.

Proud to have attended the ‚ÄúFreedom of Journey‚Äù event at VASC ‚Äî one of the many meaningful events in the Black April Commemoration series. This powerful gathering, hosted by VASC, VAR, Supervisor Betty Duong, ICAN, Viet-American Mental Health Network, Ao Dai Festival, and SCC Behavioral Health Services, brought our community together to reflect on the incredible sacrifices made during the journey to freedom. We were reminded that freedom is never free ‚Äî it is earned, fought for, and often comes with heartbreaking loss. We also honored the stories of resilience and remembered those who never made it, but whose hopes continue to live on through us. Grateful to be part of this moment of remembrance, healing, and unity.

Yesterday at the Great Frenzy Chase at Grand Century Mall, I had the chance to meet the Sharks and Barracuda staff! üíô A huge thank you to SJPD for joining us and making the event even more special. The TechCU Arena has been open and is ready for everyone to support and enjoy the Barracudas, along with many more exciting events. It‚Äôs absolutely amazing, and I can‚Äôt wait to see even more people there in the future!
