# Meet Vice Mayor Pam Foley

![CM Pam Foley_Resized Blue Bkgd Larger](https://www.sanjoseca.gov/home/showpublishedimage/18726/638187087248230000)

Pam Foley first earned her seat in November of 2018 to represent District 9, which includes neighborhoods in the southwest corner of San José. During her reelection campaign, she ran unopposed and was sworn in to serve her second term in January 2023.

In January 2025, she was nominated by the Mayor and confirmed by her colleagues on the City Council to serve in the expanded role as Vice Mayor.

Prior to being elected to San José City Council, she served for 14 years as a School Board Trustee for the San José Unified School District. During her time as trustee, she oversaw the education of 31,000 students and a budget of $400 million.

As a product of public schools herself, Pam graduated from high school in 1977, then attended the University of San Francisco.

Pam is one of six children, and was born and raised in Portland, Oregon. Pam and her husband, Mike were married in 1983. In 1987, Pam and her husband purchased their first home in the Cambrian Area of San José on Reedhurst Ave. After a brief move to the Santa Cruz Mountains, they settled in the South Willow Glen Area of San José where they raised their daughter Katelin.

Pam has served as chairman of Women and Their Children’s Housing (WATCH), a transitional housing program for victims of domestic violence and their children. She continues to volunteer her time with the Rotary Club of San José and has been involved with The Enterprise Leadership Conference (ELC) for 20+ years.

In 2019, she was recognized by Bay Area Municipal Election Committee (BAYMEC) as an LGBTQ+ ally and was awarded the Stan Hajduk award. In addition, she received the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Character Award in 2017 and has since continued to dedicate time to many BSA events.
