# Welcome to District 2

## Message from the Councilmember:

Dear District 2 Neighbors, 

Welcome to the official San Jose District 2 webpage! I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to serve the diverse and vibrant communities of South San Jose. 

This site is designed to be your central hub for all things District 2. Here, you can find the latest updates on City Council actions, learn about my policy priorities, and access valuable resources for addressing issues in your neighborhood. 

As your councilmember, I am committed to developing a policy agenda that strengthens the bonds and connections within our communities, enhances public safety, and prioritizes sustainable solutions to address the housing crisis in San Jose. 

Building a stronger District 2 requires a collective effort, and there are many ways to get involved. 

One of the most impactful ways to make a difference in your neighborhood is by joining a local neighborhood association. You can connect with neighbors, share ideas, and work together on projects that benefit the community. 

In addition to knowing your neighbors, staying informed is essential. For ongoing updates and to remain informed, please subscribe to our newsletter and follow my social media channels. 

I'm excited to work alongside you and make meaningful progress for District 2 in the years to come. 

In Community,

Councilmember Pamela Campos
