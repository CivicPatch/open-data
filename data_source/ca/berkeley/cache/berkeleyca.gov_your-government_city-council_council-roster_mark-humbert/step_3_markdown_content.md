Councilmember, District 8

# Mark Humbert

**Elected:**

November 2022

**Current Term Ends:**

November 2026

Mark is a 20-year-plus resident of the Elmwood, where he and his wife Karin have raised their two daughters, both graduates of John Muir Elementary, Willard Middle School and Berkeley High. He is a graduate of Berkeley Law, and has had a long career as a federal court litigator, arbitrator, and mediator. Before his election to Council in November 2022, Mark served, consecutively, on the Transportation, Public Works, Fair Campaign Practices and Parks, Recreation &amp; Waterfront Commissions. He also served for many years as board member and president of the Claremont Elmwood Neighborhood Association. Mark intends to follow Councilmember Lori Droste to serve as a champion for a Berkeley that is inclusive, welcoming, and affordable for everyone. He believes that people at all income levels and life stages should have access to Berkeley's incredible amenities and opportunities. Mark is deeply committed to making our streets and public spaces safer and more enjoyable, and to improving the quality of life for all Berkeleyans.
