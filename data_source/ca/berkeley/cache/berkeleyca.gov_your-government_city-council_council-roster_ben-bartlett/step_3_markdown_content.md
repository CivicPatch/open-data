Councilmember, South Berkeley, District 3

# Ben Bartlett

**Elected:**

November 2016

**Current Term Ends:**

November 2024

Ben Bartlett is a 5th generation Berkeley native, attorney, and lifelong advocate for equity and inclusion. As the son of political activists, Bartlett learned the value of community and the necessity of progress. Those values of innovation, opportunity, and inclusion continue to inform his work serving as the City Councilmember representing South Berkeley, District 3.

Before becoming a Councilmember, Bartlett served in the Transportation Commission, where he worked on local EV (electric vehicle) infrastructure. He also served as the Vice-Chair on the Zero Waste Commission, where he helped pass Berkeley's historic plastic bag ban and solid waste to energy deal. Bartlett also served on the Loan Advisory Board, the Planning Commission, and the Police Review Commission.

Since 2016, Bartlett has passed more than 100 innovative and transformative progressive policies. His passion for new government approaches is closely aligned with an eye for equity, specifically defending low-income communities and people of color. Bartlett has fought tirelessly to create additional housing opportunities for residents of Berkeley and transformed the atmosphere of public safety for District 3. As a city council member, he has passed legislation that secured funding to develop the nation’s first prefabricated step-up housing for the unhoused population. Bartlett has helped begin and lead Berkeley’s [ADU](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wqFhV0fD8b2Up02fQgucGgo1q4T3EvCR) (accessory dwelling unit) task force to establish and build more homes. Bartlett has passed legislation to push for the creation of low-cost [Microbond Community Financing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X7eSKv_My2w6Wvf2zCPJzOLAkzuQS6Bl/view?usp=sharing), prioritizing [mental health calls](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mEDiWuuScJWz1EWfmvs_AYnYkYUNUSMX/view?usp=sharing), ensuring [disadvantaged communities have a share in the cannabis industry](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GoQEoORmZIj8cziS6jDZ7mrp7Y2dRhsn/view?usp=sharing), and incentivizing [hiring minority and locally-owned businesses](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kklvl4ulWjj4cAWk1I8qc2aPRiBR75fX/view?usp=sharing).
