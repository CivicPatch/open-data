### Biography

Chuck Conder was sworn into office to represent Ward 4 on the Riverside City Council on June 27, 2017. Councilmember Conder was reelected in June of 2021 and sworn in to a new 5-year term on July 13, 2021. Chuck is a retired Air Force Officer and businessman who came to Riverside in 1986 when he was assigned to duties at March Air Force Base.

After graduating from the University of Massachusetts with a degree in Businesses Management, Chuck was commissioned in 1979 as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Air Force. After retiring from the Air Force, Chuck went into business working for Primerica Financial Services.

Chuck is actively involved with the city and our community. In addition to his duties as a City Councilmember, Chuck also serves on the March Joint Powers Commission (JPC) as the Past-Chair, as the Chair of the March Inland Port Airport Authority Sub-Committee, as the Chairman of the March Joint Powers Utility Authority, as a Commissioner on the Riverside County Transportation Commission (RCTC), as a Commissioner for the Western Riverside Council of Governments (WRCOG), as a member of the Board of Directors of the March Field Air Museum (MFAM) and is a member of the recently formed March ARB Compatible Use Study (MCUS) Project. Chuck has served for many years as a member on the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce Military Affairs Committee and as a member of the Riverside County Water Task Force. Previously, he served for many years on the Riverside Unified School District Superintendent’s Advisory Council.

In addition to his responsibilities as a Councilmember to the city of Riverside and other county agencies, Chuck is a board member of Fueled by the Fallen, America’s premier non-profit organization dedicated to Remembering and Honoring our fallen heroes.

A widower, Chuck was married to his blessed wife Sharon for just shy of 37 years. They have four children and five wonderful grandchildren.

 

#### [Vision &amp; Goals](https://www.riversideca.gov/council/wards/ward-4/)

- ##### **Make our neighborhoods safer**
  
  Keeping residents and families safe is Chuck’s top priority.
  
  Chuck is committed to putting more police officers on our streets and building a full-service police station to serve the Orangecrest and Mission Grove neighborhoods. Improving police protection and response times will help reduce crime.
  
  Chuck is working to aggressively combat mail theft and other property crimes currently plaguing our community.
  
  ##### **Protect our tax dollars**
  
  I will hold City Hall accountable for how it spends our money.
  
  I believe the city must always live within its means. Chuck will oppose new debt, new taxes, and pay raises for the City Council. This will protect funding for vital city services like Fire and Police protection.
  
  Chuck will make the repair and maintenance of our damaged streets a top city budget priority.
  
  Chuck believes we can make better use of our tax dollars by bringing innovative technology to the City that will improve efficiency and reduce costs.
  
  ##### **Improve our quality of life**
  
  Chuck will establish regular office hours at Orange Terrace and Villegas Community Centers, bringing City Hall out of downtown and to the people.
  
  He will seek ways to increase housing opportunities for Veterans in our city.
  
  Chuck is also committed to working with our schools to ensure they teach all children the skills they need to succeed in the 21st Century economy.
