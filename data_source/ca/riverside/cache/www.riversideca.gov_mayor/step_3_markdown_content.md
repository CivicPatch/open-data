### City of Riverside Supporting LA Wildfire Relief Efforts

Mayor Lock Dawson and the City of Riverside are partnering with the California Community Foundation to assist those affected by the recent wildfires in Los Angeles County. While news coverage has slowed, the impacted families’ need for support continues to grow. Together, we ask that Riverside residents consider providing a financial donation to support our neighbors to the west in their long road to recovery. As a community, we can unite and make a greater impact. By donating, you will help rebuild lives and restore communities. Your donation will directly support the California Community Foundation—give what you can today and thank you for stepping up to make a difference. Note: Please make sure to select both boxes on the donation form if you wish to donate anonymously

The view from my office each day. We must recommit ourselves to César Chávez’s ideals of non-violence and justice for all. How are you doing this important work here in Riverside? [https://t.co/0Ln3g4pDII](https://t.co/0Ln3g4pDII)
