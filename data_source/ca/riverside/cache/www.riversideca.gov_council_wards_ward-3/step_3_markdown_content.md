### Biography

Steven Robillard was sworn into office to represent Ward 3 on the Riverside City Council on April 9, 2024. A lifelong resident of Riverside and dedicated business owner, Councilmember Robillard brings a wealth of local knowledge and entrepreneurial spirit to his role.

After graduating from Woodcrest Christian High School, Steven pursued higher education at Riverside City College and obtained a Bachelor's degree in Political Science from UC Riverside. Armed with a strong academic foundation, he obtained a Realtor® license and embarked on a successful career in Real Estate. Steven's expertise in Land and Commercial Sales has solidified his reputation as one of Riverside's premier agents.

Beyond his professional achievements, Steven is deeply committed to serving his community. In addition to his responsibilities as a City Councilmember, he serves as Chairman of the Economic Development Committee, Vice Chair of the Finance Committee and is a Member of the Housing and Homelessness Committee. He also lends his expertise as a board member for the Urban Land Institute’s For Sale Housing Council – OC/IE and has previously contributed to the Agricultural Water Rate Task Force.

Steven's dedication to Riverside extends to his personal life as well. He married his high school sweetheart, Lexie Robillard, in 2015, and together they are proud parents to their son, Logan.

#### [Vision &amp; Goals](https://www.riversideca.gov/council/wards/ward-3/)

**Homelessness / Public Safety** - We need to take public safety seriously. Crime rates are soaring, and the homelessness problem continues to worsen. Our neighbors shouldn't have to feel anxious about going to the store or walking around the neighborhood. It's time to allocate more resources towards public safety and address the homeless crisis effectively. My top priority is to ensure the safety of our neighborhoods, parks, and shopping centers.

**Promoting Growth** - We must reestablish a focus on business at City Hall. Riverside has an abundance of opportunities, and we should embrace policies that foster a business-friendly environment. With three universities and a community college in Riverside, we have a pool of talented graduates who unfortunately leave our city due to limited job prospects. We possess the necessary tools, resources, and talent to become an economic hub, but it requires council members with a business mindset to transform that potential into reality.

**Infrastructure** - Infrastructure plays a vital role in Riverside's development. As we continue to expand housing and development across the city, we must prioritize improving our infrastructure. It's time to invest in road repairs and implement traffic mitigation measures. We all deserve to live in a beautifully maintained city, and that's precisely what I will advocate for on the City Council.

#### [Programs &amp; Projects](https://www.riversideca.gov/council/wards/ward-3/)

Revitalizing and investing here will improve quality of life and drive long-term economic growth in Ward 3.

**Restoration and Revitalization of Riverside Airport**  
Riverside Airport is a valuable city asset with untapped potential.  
Focusing on key upgrades to the runway, hangars, and facilities.  
Aiming to transform the airport into a hub for education, manufacturing, commerce, and economic growth.

Supporting and empowering seniors is a top priority.
