## Code of Ethics and Conduct

The citizens and businesses of Simi Valley are entitled to have fair, ethical, and accountable local government that has earned the public’s full confidence for integrity. To this end, the Simi Valley City Council has adopted a [Code of Ethics and Conduct](https://www.simivalley.org/home/showpublisheddocument/27/637211647768470000) for elected officials and members of appointed boards, commissions, and committees.

## Statements of Economic Interests

California Government Code Section 87500 requires the above-listed elected officers of the City of Simi Valley (the Simi Valley City Council), identified in California Government Code Section 87200, to file Statements of Economic Interests with the City Clerk. Pursuant to California Government Code Section 87505, copies of their Statements of Economic Interests are available at:

- Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC): 428 J Street, Suite 620, Sacramento, CA 95814
- Simi Valley City Clerk's Office: 2929 Tapo Canyon Road, Simi Valley, CA 93063

Statements of Economic Interests for some state and local government agencies' elected officers may also be available in an electronic format on the [FPPC website](https://www.fppc.ca.gov/Form700.html).

## Form 806

The California Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) requires cities to post a single Form 806 (FPPC Regulation 18705.5 amended 03.2012). Form 806 reports additional compensation that officials receive when appointing themselves to positions on other committees, boards or commissions of a public agency, special districts, and joint power agencies/authorities. Each agency must post a single Form 806 listing all paid appointed positions including the date appointed, length of term, and stipend amount.
