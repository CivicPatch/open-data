 City Council and Mayor

### City Council and Mayor

Moreno Valley is governed by a directly elected mayor and a four-member elected City Council. There are volunteer [Commissions, Committees, Councils and Boards](https://www.moval.gov/city_council/index.html/boards-commission-landing.html), as well as several Citizen Advisory Committees to help guide the Council in its decisions. The council appoints the [City Manager](https://www.moval.gov/city_council/departments/city-manager.html), who oversees the City's daily operations.

### About Council Government

The City Councilmembers are elected officers identified in Government Code Section 87200 and file statements of economic interests with the [City Clerk's office](https://www.moval.gov/city_council/departments/city-clerk/index.html). In 2014, voters approved the direct election of a City Mayor.

#### City Council Districts

On May 13, 2014, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 2014-33 creating new districts for the City.

[**Redistricting 2022 Adopted Plan**](https://www.moval.gov/city_council/index.html/maps/CouncilDistricts2024_041624A.pdf)  
On Aril 5, 2022, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 2022-24 adopting the preferred district map (the existing map) based on the 2020 census, pursuant to E.C. 21600.
