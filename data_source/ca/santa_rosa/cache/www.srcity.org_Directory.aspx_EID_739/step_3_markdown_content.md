# Jeff Okrepkie

 

[City Council](https://www.srcity.org/Directory.aspx?DID=112)  
Title: Councilmember - District 6

## Councilmember Jeff Okrepkie

Jeff Okrepkie, a proud native of Santa Rosa, grew up in Bennett Valley before attending Arizona State University. After a decade in the Valley of the Sun and a brief time in Santa Cruz, Jeff returned to Sonoma County, where he now works as a Commercial Producer at George Petersen Insurance Agency.  

Jeff’s commitment to serving his community has defined his career and personal life. After the 2017 Tubbs Fire destroyed his family’s home in Coffey Park, Jeff founded Coffey Strong, a nonprofit organization that united the neighborhood and provided resources to over 1,300 homeowners during the rebuilding process. 

His leadership and dedication were recognized by the American Red Cross, State Senator Mike McGuire, The North Bay Business Journal, and the Sonoma County Economic Development Board, among others, underscoring the widespread impact of his efforts to create a more efficient and collaborative recovery for fire survivors.  

Jeff’s contributions extend across many sectors of the community. He is a past board member of the Northern California Engineering Contractors Association, a founding board member of the Santa Rosa Fire Foundation, and currently serves on the boards of the Sonoma County Transportation Authority and the Regional Climate Protection Agency. He also serves as an alternate on Sonoma County Local Agency Formation Commission, reflecting his dedication to fostering sustainable growth and regional connectivity.  

Elected to the Santa Rosa City Council in 2022, Jeff has remained steadfast in his mission to improve the city he calls home. He advocates for wildfire recovery, improved transportation infrastructure, addressing gang violence in schools, and fostering greater resilience and connectivity throughout Santa Rosa and Sonoma County. He serves as chair of the Public Safety Subcommittee, while also serving on the Economic Development Subcommittee and Open Government Task Force.  

Jeff lives in his rebuilt home with his family and remains committed to building a vibrant, resilient future for the city and its residents.
