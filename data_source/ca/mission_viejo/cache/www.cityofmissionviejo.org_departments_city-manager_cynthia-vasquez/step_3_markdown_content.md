# Councilmember Cynthia Vasquez

![](https://www.cityofmissionviejo.org/sites/default/files/Cynthia-Vasquez-Headshot.jpg)

Cynthia Vasquez, MBA, was elected to the Mission Viejo City Council in November 2022 for a four-year term.  She is the first representative for District 3 in Mission Viejo's inaugural District Elections.  Cynthia's top priorities include public safety, improving quality of life, fiscal responsibility, and economic development.

Cynthia has shown a strong commitment to public safety and traffic management in Mission Viejo.  Her initiatives include advocating for lower speed limits near schools, increasing the number of crossing guards, adding marked crosswalks near parks and schools, and installing a protective fence around Napoli Park.

She is also focused on improving safety at intersections along Marguerite Parkway and Avery Parkway, including advocating for the addition of acceleration lanes.  Cynthia has supported expanding the Mission Viejo shuttle service to help students, reduce traffic, and support events around the City.  She maintains communication with local schools and the community to ensure ongoing collaboration.

Cynthia is committed to promoting mental health and wellness, as well as supporting programs that complement the City’s strong environmental efforts.  She is dedicated to managing taxpayer money responsibly and emphasizes transparency and accountability.  Cynthia brings a thoughtful perspective to her leadership role and makes decisions that balance facts and data with what provides value to the community. 

As a leader in fiscal responsibility, Cynthia supports self-sustaining programs.  One of her notable achievements is helping organize Mission Viejo’s first-ever Pride event in 2024.  The event attracted roughly 2,000 attendees, over 15 sponsors, and featured more than 40 booths.  Cynthia and the organizing committee raised more than $18,000.

Cynthia serves as the City’s liaison to the Mission Viejo Diversity + Inclusion Task Force.  She is proud to support programs and events for veterans, minorities, individuals with disabilities, religious groups, and the LGBTQ+ community, reflecting the true character and diversity in Mission Viejo.

Community service has been a lifelong passion for Cynthia, starting with her early years as a Girl Scout.  She has passed this commitment on to her daughters by taking on leadership roles as a Troop Leader and Troop Cookie Mom.  Cynthia also regularly volunteers to support community programs.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Cynthia played a crucial role as the Mission Viejo distribution center for the Healthcare Mask Collaborative (HMC).  She not only sewed hundreds of cloth face masks but also managed the distribution point, helping to ensure that over 65,000 masks were distributed to 150 organizations.

Cynthia holds an MBA from Gies College of Business at the University of Illinois and a bachelor's degree in Philosophy from George Washington University.  She is the founder of Propel Consulting, with over 20 years of experience in legal technology.  Cynthia has actively contributed to industry organizations, serving as a mentor and participating on several chapter boards.  She is also a speaker at industry conferences, addressing topics such as women's empowerment and technology adoption.

Cynthia Vasquez is a Southern California native.  She and her husband, Alan, have been married for twenty years.  They moved to South Orange County in 2005 and Mission Viejo in 2011.  Their children attend public schools in Mission Viejo, and Alan serves as a healthcare provider at the Long Beach VA.
