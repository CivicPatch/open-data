# Councilmember Trish Kelley

![](https://www.cityofmissionviejo.org/sites/default/files/Trish-Kelley.jpg)

Trish Kelley was originally elected to the Mission Viejo City Council in November 2002.  She has served as Mayor in 2005, 2008, 2010, 2014, 2021 and 2024.  Trish believes that quality of life, public safety, economic development, and transportation are the primary concerns of our residents and works hard to preserve and enhance those areas. 

During her years of service on the City Council, Trish has successfully promoted many programs and improvements to enhance the quality of life in Mission Viejo.  She advanced the expansion of the Norman P. Murray Community and Senior Center, the renovations of Montanoso and Sierra Recreation Centers and the Marguerite Tennis Center and the Marguerite Aquatics Center, the addition of three new parks, and she spearheaded the effort to bring a senior transportation program to Mission Viejo.  She supported road-widening projects on Crown Valley, Alicia, and Oso Parkways and various signal and road improvements city-wide.  Trish continues to promote the regular renovations of our City parks, to provide updated equipment and enhancements for the enjoyment of our residents.  She also supported the City's purchase of Oso Creek Golf Course to preserve over 100 acres of open space and to save and improve a beloved asset in Mission Viejo.  

In 2003, Trish led the City Council to establish Mission Viejo as a City of Character.   She helped to develop a city-wide character program, which focuses on a different character quality each month.  She wrote the curriculum, which is provided to the City's 25 schools, various City facilities, and featured on the City website.  The program has received awards at the state and national levels.   Trish has been a presenter at state and national conferences, teaching other organizations how to bring similar character programs to their communities.

Trish serves on the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) Regional Council and Transportation Committee, and the Transportation Corridor Agencies Board of Directors.

The Marine Corps brought Trish and her husband, Jack, here in 1977 when he served as a pilot at the Marine Corps Air Station at El Toro.  Trish has been volunteering in the community since she moved to Mission Viejo.  She has been an active volunteer in church, youth sports, Boy Scouts/Girl Scouts, Relay for Life, Saddleback College Foundation, and served as PTA President at three different schools. The Kelleys have three grown children and nine young grandchildren. Trish continues to understand and support family and children's issues through her involvement with her grandchildren's activities, volunteering at de Portola Elementary School, staying in touch with our Mission Viejo school principals, and interactions with various Boy Scout and Girl Scout troops.  She also stays informed and active with senior issues, events and programs.  She is an active member of Compass Bible Church.
