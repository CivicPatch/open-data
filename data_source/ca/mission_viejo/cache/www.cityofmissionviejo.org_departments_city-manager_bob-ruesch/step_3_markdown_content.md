# Mayor Bob Ruesch

![](https://www.cityofmissionviejo.org/sites/default/files/Bob-Ruesch-Headshot.jpg)

Mayor Robert "Bob" Ruesch came to Mission Viejo in 1994 with his wife Debbie to find a safer and better place to raise their family. Bob &amp; Debbie have two adult children, daughter Kate who resides in England with her family, and their son Andrew who resides in Mar Vista with his family. They have three grandsons, Luke, Zach, and Walter.

Bob was a leader in the Boy Scouts of America for over twenty years, helping many young men including his son obtain the rank of Eagle. He has been part of a faith-based study for over twenty-five years.

Bob's career has taken many paths. As an entrepreneur, he started five businesses and has held many executive level positions in the private sector. Bob served on a Presidential Task Force for the Reagan Presidency. Bob is a well-established authority on marketing, an accomplished pilot, rock climbing instructor, and motorsport racer.

In 2016, Bob was appointed to the Community Services Commission and served for two years collaborating with staff to encourage recreation and community involvement with the many amenities offered to Mission Viejo residents. In 2017, Bob was appointed to represent Mission Viejo as their representative to the Orange County Mosquito and Vector Control District and continues to hold that position. In 2018 Bob accepted the appointment to move to the Planning and Transportation Commission. During the next four years Bob was involved with many new and critical issues that the City Council would eventually adopt:

- Being Chairman during the purchase of the Oso Creek Golf Course
- Revising the Economic Development Element
- Beginning implementation of the "Core Area Vision Plan" and "Public Place and Land Use Elements"

He held this appointment until December of 2022 when he became the first Councilmember for the new Mission Viejo District 1.

Working as a Councilmember, he has a board position on the OCFA Fire Authority and serves as Chairman of Operations. He also serves as a board member of the Orange County Mosquito and Vector Control District, and ACCOC.

**Bob's current accomplishments for District 1 and the City of Mission include:**

- Los Osos revitalization program
- A Community Theatre feasibility study
- Mission Viejo's budget balanced 2023-2025
- Crime reduction and establishing neighborhood watch programs.
- Support development and growth of local businesses in Mission Viejo by being a member of the Mission Viejo Chamber of Commerce
- Continue the work on the Oso Creek Golf Course, the open area between Casta Del Sol Drive and Jeronimo, and the Downtown Core Vision Plan
- Initiated the search for a preforming arts facility to showcase local talent and performances of music and drama
