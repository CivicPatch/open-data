Brian won the Congressional Gold Medal of Achievement as a member of the 1980 USA Olympic Men’s Swimming Team that boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics.

The citizens elected Brian to the Mission Viejo City Council in 2016, and he has served as a council member, Mayor Pro Tem, and Mayor in 2020, and he was re-elected to serve as Mayor in 2023. Brian led the city with distinction during the outbreak of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Notable accomplishments under Brian’s leadership include:

- Acquiring the Oso Creek Golf Course and open space,
- Developing new parks and recreation facilities,
- Enhancing public safety by adding more school resource officers, and
- Acquiring "The Mart" building to further the Community Core Vision Plan.

Brian and his wife Vicki have been married for over 40 years and raised their three sons in Mission Viejo. All five Goodell’s are alumni of Mission Viejo High School. They have six grandchildren. Brian and Vicki own The Gold Medal Group Inc., REALTORS® with Berkshire Hathaway Home Services, California Properties. They have helped countless families buy and sell homes in the area. Brian has developed many properties over the past 38 years, including Rancho Santa Margarita, where he worked for ten years as the Director of Business Properties.

Brian participates in several charitable organizations in the community. He is a member of the Benevolent Order of the Elks, a former President of the Orange County Youth Sports Foundation, a member of St. Killian’s Catholic Church and the Orange County Sports Commission Board.

Brian looks forward to guiding the city in economic development, conservative fiscal controls, and enhanced public safety. He serves on the city’s Economic Development Committee, and the Sports and Event Tourism Committee.
