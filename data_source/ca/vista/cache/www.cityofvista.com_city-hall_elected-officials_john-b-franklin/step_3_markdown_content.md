### Mayor John Franklin

**2022-2026: Mayor**  
**2022: Deputy Mayor**  
**2018-2022: Council Member**  
**2019 and 2017:** **Appointed Deputy Mayor**  
**2014-2018: Council Member**

Elected on a platform focusing on solutions to homelessness and improved public safety, Mayor John Franklin was a leader in the creation of Vista’s award-winning [Homelessness Strategic Plan](https://www.vista.gov/departments/housing-homeless-services/homeless-strategic-plan).

First elected to the Vista Irrigation District Board of Directors in 2012 and elected to the Vista City Council in 2014, Franklin was appointed by his colleagues to serve as Deputy Mayor in 2017, 2019 &amp; 2022. Franklin is the fourth directly elected Mayor of the City of Vista. 

Franklin is also a strong believer in a fiscally responsible and transparent government and has worked to improve Vista’s financial position on the City Council.  During his tenure, the City has achieved new levels of financial stability, eliminated the structural budget deficit, and the city’s bond rating has improved. The City’s emergency reserves have increased to 35% and continue to grow, ensuring important services will not be jeopardized during future economic downturns.

Franklin has also been a strong advocate for improving traffic flows in our community to get residents home safer and faster. In addition to his core priorities, Franklin has worked to eliminate blight in Vista, improve our parks, acquire new public park lands, and promote public art in our community. 

In support of the City’s long-term efforts to revitalize downtown and the Santa Fe corridor, he has worked to create a business-friendly climate to attract new investments and employers to Vista.

A graduate of The American University in Washington, D.C., Franklin served nearly a decade as a congressional policy advisor before opening his own small business in Vista. John and his wife Shanna are residents of Shadowridge in Vista.
