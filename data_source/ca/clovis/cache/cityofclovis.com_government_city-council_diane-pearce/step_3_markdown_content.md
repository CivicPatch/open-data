# Mayor Pro Tem Diane Pearce

![](https://cityofclovis.com/wp-content/uploads/Pearce-Diane-1-214x300.jpg)

> “As someone who has lived in this area my entire life, I’ve always known Clovis was special. It is no surprise more and more people are wanting to be a part of this exceptional place. My husband and I were fortunate enough to build a home and move our family to Clovis in 2019. And it was for more than the good schools and safe neighborhoods…we came for the values of local control and community engagement. In order to preserve our Clovis Way of Life for future generations, we must continue to prioritize the things that have created our success as a city. It is my privilege to serve on the City Council and it is my commitment to be a strong voice for the local control and conservative governance that have made Clovis such a jewel in this State.”
