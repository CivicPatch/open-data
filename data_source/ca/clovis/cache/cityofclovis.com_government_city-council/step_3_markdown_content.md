# Clovis City Council

As the elected legislative body of the City of Clovis, the City Council has overall responsibility for the scope, direction, and financing of City services. The City Council, as the legislative body, establishes policy that is administered and implemented through full time staff under the Council-Manager form of government. The Council is also responsible for establishing land use policies through the General Plan and zoning regulations.

Clovis voters, at large, elect a 5-member Council to serve as the City’s legislative and governing body. The members serve 4 year terms and they elect one member to serve as mayor and one to serve as mayor pro tem for two years. A general municipal election is held every two years, alternating, between two and three, positions each cycle.

Under the Council-Manager form of government, the City Council provides policy direction to the City Manager, who is responsible for administering City operations. In setting policy, the Council works closely with citizen advisory commissions and committees, considers staff information and recommendations, and receives comments from the general public.

## City Council Meeting Time

Clovis City Council meetings are held at 6:00 p.m. on the first, second, and third Mondays of each month unless such Monday is a legal holiday, in which event the meeting will be held on the next business day at 6:00 p.m. (Ordinance 09-24).
