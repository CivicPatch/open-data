# Mayor Vong Mouanoutoua

![](https://cityofclovis.com/wp-content/uploads/Mouanoutoua-Vong-1-214x300.jpg)Vong came to the United States of America on Monday, November 15, 1976.  His family immigrated here as refugees from Laos, after the kingdom of Laos fell to communist rule. Many Hmong fought alongside America during the Vietnam War; however, their battles were fought in neighboring Laos in a “Secret War,” that few knew about. Over one third of the Hmong people died in that war while rescuing downed American pilots, stopping the Ho Chi Minh trail, and conducting special ops missions for America. Laos fell, and with it, so did freedom for an entire nation.  Thus, the Hmong had to leave a homeland that no longer welcomed them.

For many Hmong families, this thirst to live as free people led them to America and consequently, here to the Central Valley.  Vong’s father always shared with his children:

> “America provides the best opportunities for a successful life.  If you work hard, be honest, serve others, and remember God; it will lead to a worthwhile life.”

Vong moved to Clovis from Huntington Beach in 1996.  He studied at UCLA and went on to obtain his Juris Doctorate degree from San Joaquin College of Law.  He currently works as the Director of External Relations &amp; Project Development for Community Medical Centers.  He also teaches at Fresno State. When his schedule allows, he loves working with the children and youth at his church.

Passionate about service, Vong has and continues to serve in many capacities on various organizations within the community.  After dedicating over 10 years on the Clovis Planning Commission, Vong ran for and was elected onto the Clovis City Council.  He is humbled and honored to serve the residents of Clovis.

His father was right… Clovis is the shining example of worthwhile lives living together in America.  Its residents are people who work hard, who live honestly, who love serving their fellow neighbors, and who fear God.  Coincidentally, this is nothing short of what many call “The Clovis Way of Life,” and it is contagious.

Grateful for this amazing City, Vong will work hard to make sure everyone is welcomed in Clovis and that our “Way of Life” continues for you, your children, grandchildren and many, many generations thereafter.
