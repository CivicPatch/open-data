## Council Member Ryan Balius

Ryan Balius was elected to the Anaheim City Council in November 2024, representing District 1 in west Anaheim. 

A 25-year resident of west Anaheim, Balius is focused on advancing the ongoing rebuilding of Beach Boulevard with continued police enforcement, more potential motel closures and redevelopment with homes, businesses and public spaces.

District 1, which goes from north Brookhurst Street to Anaheim’s western city lines with Buena Park, Cypress and Stanton, is home to neighborhoods, businesses, parks, schools, a library and Anaheim’s 1.5-mile stretch of Beach Boulevard.

Balius is also focused on staffing and equipping Anaheim Police and firefighters, affordable housing, addressing the impacts of homelessness on businesses and neighborhoods, getting people out of homelessness with effective services and improving intersections for better safety and traffic flow.

Prior to joining the City Council, Balius served on the Anaheim Parks and Recreation Commission, starting in 2016 and most recently as chair. The commission advises the City Council and the city’s community services director on parks, recreation and programs.

He has also served as a member of the Anaheim Services Needs Assessment Youth and Family Advisory Committee in 2024. 

Earlier, Balius took part in the Beach Boulevard Specific Plan, a 2019 city plan with community input to bring homes, shopping, restaurants, other businesses and gathering places to Beach.

He was active for more than 15 years with West Anaheim Neighborhood Development Council, a resident group that staged community events and worked to better west Anaheim.

Now retired, Balius worked for 34 years at the nearby city of Cerritos, first in parks and recreation and later in information technology.

Balius, who grew up in Cerritos, is the proud son of working parents. His brother is a sailor on active duty with the Naval Construction Battalions, better known as the Seabees responsible for engineering and building bases, airfields, roads and other military needs.

He holds a bachelor’s from California State University, Fullerton, with a minor in management information systems.

Balius lives with his wife Angie, a principal in the Garden Grove Unified School District, in the same home they bought when they moved to west Anaheim 25 years ago.

He’s an Eagle Scout, the highest rank within Boy Scouts of America, and a three-time Ironman Triathlon finisher.
