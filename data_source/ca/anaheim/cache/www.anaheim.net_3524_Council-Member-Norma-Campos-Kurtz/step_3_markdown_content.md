# Council Member Norma Campos Kurtz

Norma Campos Kurtz was elected to the Anaheim City Council representing District 4 in 2024 after first being appointed to fill a vacancy in the district in 2023.

In 2024 she has served as mayor pro tem, chairing City Council meetings as needed and helping to represent the city at community and other events.

As Council member for District 4 in central-south Anaheim, Campos Kurtz represents neighborhoods at the southern end of downtown as well as around The Anaheim Resort.

She also represents the theme parks, convention center, hotels and other businesses of The Anaheim Resort, which together drive the largest portion of the city's revenue for public safety, community services and city obligations.

Campos Kurtz is focused on addressing neighborhood issues as well as promoting a strong, diversified economy in The Anaheim Resort.

She is focused on traffic and park improvements, addressing homelessness, affordability and other housing issues, expanding public safety, Code Enforcement, senior programs and other city services.

Campos Kurtz was first appointed to the District 4 Council seat to fill a vacancy created by the election of Avelino Valencia to the state Assembly in 2022.

Before joining the Council, Campos Kurtz served on the Anaheim Public Utilities Board from 2021 up to her 2023 Council appointment. The seven-member board makes recommendations to the City Council about the electric and water operations of Anaheim Public Utilities.

Campos Kurtz also served for eight years as a commissioner on Housing and Community Development Commission, which advises the City Council on community development and use of federal housing funding.

She serves as secretary for Anaheim Beautiful and previously was committee chair for the nonprofit's annual Holiday Lights contest, which promotes neighborhood pride by recognizing homes that stand out with decorations. 

Before joining the Council, Campos Kurtz served as district director for former California Assemblymember Tom Daly, who represented Anaheim and opted not to run for re-election in 2022.

From 2010 to 2014, she served as director of workforce and economic development for the Orange County Labor Federation, an Orange-based federation of local unions.

Campos Kurtz also served as vice president of the California Medical Association, a Sacramento-based group representing doctors, medical groups and other healthcare providers, from 2007 to 2009.

From 1998 to 2006, Campos Kurtz served as district director for former California Sen. Joe Dunn, who represented Anaheim as part of his Senate district.

Earlier in her career, Campos Kurtz was an associate vice president at Pacific Bell, now AT&amp;T Inc., where she worked for more than 20 years, including as a service representative and in directing corporate contributions.

Campos Kurtz is a 20-year resident of Anaheim. She lives in District 4 with her husband Ken.
