## Mayor Pro Tem Natalie Meeks

Natalie Meeks was elected to the Anaheim City Council in November 2022, representing District 6 in east Anaheim.

Council Member Meeks also currently serves as mayor pro tem, chairing City Council meetings and representing the city as a whole as needed.

Before joining the City Council, Meeks served on Anaheim’s Planning Commission from 2019 to late 2022, including as chair in 2021 and 2022.

On the Council, Meeks is focused on safety and quality of life issues through adding officers to the Anaheim Police Department, reducing crime, addressing homelessness, improving fire evacuation in Anaheim Hills and expanding and building on the area’s parks, trails and libraries.

She also led the city's consideration and 2024 adoption of Strategic Plan Anaheim, a comprehensive blueprint of community priorities and guiding principles to lead work on behalf of residents, businesses and visitors.

Meeks has dedicated her career to public service, most recently serving as Public Works director of the city of Anaheim from 2007 to 2016.

By the time of her retirement, Meeks oversaw Orange County’s largest city Public Works department with a yearly budget of more than $300 million and 250 employees.

In her Anaheim Public Works career, Meeks worked on the late-1990s expansion of The Anaheim Resort, expansion of the Anaheim Convention Center, the building of the ARTIC transit hub, the addition of the East Anaheim Gymnasium and a police substation at the East Anaheim Community Center and many other significant projects citywide.

Meeks began her Anaheim career in 1987 as an assistant civil engineer, moving up to principal civil engineer in 1989, development services manager in 1992, deputy city engineer in 2006 and director in 2007.

In 2015, she was named a Top Ten Leader by the American Public Works Association.

Meeks is a longtime resident of Anaheim Hills, where she raised her daughter as a single mother.

Together, they took part in Anaheim Hills sports leagues and volunteered at the Oak Canyon Nature Center. The family continues to be part of the yearly Anaheim Hills 4th of July Celebration, concerts in the park and other community events.

Meeks is first in her family to graduate from college, earning a bachelor’s in civil engineering from California State University, Fullerton, and a master’s in organizational leadership from Chapman University.
