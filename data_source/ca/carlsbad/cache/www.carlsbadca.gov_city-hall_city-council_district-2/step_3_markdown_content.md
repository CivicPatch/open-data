## Empty heading

From my experience as a Marine Corps veteran, retired Fire Captain, small business owner and father raising two beautiful daughters, it has been an honor to have served in each capacity and now as your Carlsbad City Council Member. As a Carlsbad resident since the 1990s and a homeowner since 2007, I feel a great sense of ownership in ensuring our city maintains outstanding services and preserves the unique culture and characteristics that make us Carlsbad.

As a small business owner, I am also focused on maintaining the city’s economic vitality. A healthy local economy benefits businesses and residents, while creating new opportunities for our children to succeed.
