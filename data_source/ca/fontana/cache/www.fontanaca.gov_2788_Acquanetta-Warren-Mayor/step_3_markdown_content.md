## Biography

Acquanetta Warren is a trailblazing four-term Mayor of the City of Fontana, California, first elected in 2010 and consistently re-elected by a community that trusts her bold vision and proven results. She is the first woman and first African American to serve as Mayor in the city’s history—and has emerged as one of the nation’s most dynamic and influential municipal leaders, shaping Fontana into a thriving hub of innovation, opportunity, and equity. 

A widely respected public figure with a national presence, Mayor Warren has earned widespread recognition for her leadership and was even featured on CBS’s Undercover Boss, where she brought Fontana’s story—and its hardworking public servants—to millions of viewers across the country. Her powerful advocacy has made her a sought-after speaker and trusted partner at the highest levels of government. 

Under her leadership, Fontana has become a model for sustainable economic growth, educational innovation, and community health. A passionate advocate for job creation and business development, Mayor Warren has positioned Fontana at the heart of the global supply chain, championing major infrastructure investments—including the reconstruction of four freeway interchanges—to drive goods movement, enhance public safety, and support a booming logistics sector.

Determined to diversify the workforce and break industry barriers, Mayor Warren launched the Mayor’s Manufacturing Council and hosted the inaugural Inland Empire Women in Manufacturing Summit, which drew over 500 participants. She also created Open for Business, a city-run television series highlighting local entrepreneurs and showcasing Fontana’s vibrant business ecosystem.

In 2019, Mayor Warren declared a State of Emergency on Education, forging the Mayor’s Education Coalition—a powerful alliance of schools, businesses, and community leaders focused on workforce readiness and real-world skills. Her call to action is clear: every child in Fontana deserves access to the education and career opportunities of the future.

Mayor Warren has also led with compassion and accountability on one of the most urgent challenges facing cities nationwide: homelessness. Under her leadership, Fontana has launched the largest expansion of affordable housing in the city’s history and established The PATH—a temporary homeless resource center designed to help families and individuals in crisis find immediate support and long-term stability. Through the Mayor’s Council on Homelessness, she continues to align city and regional efforts around sustainable, coordinated solutions that address homelessness holistically and humanely. 

A longtime champion for community wellness, Mayor Warren founded the award-winning Healthy Fontana initiative, which promotes nutrition education and active lifestyles. Its flagship program, Fontana Walks!, has inspired residents to log nearly 9 billion steps since its launch and earned national recognition for its innovation and impact. In 2016, the U.S. Conference of Mayors named Fontana the top mid-sized city in America for combating childhood obesity. 

Mayor Warren’s influence extends far beyond city hall. In 2018, she was appointed by President Donald J. Trump to the Intergovernmental Policy Advisory Committee (IGPAC), where she completed a four-year term advising the U.S. Trade Representative on international trade issues. In this national capacity, she championed the priorities of local governments and helped ensure cities were represented in federal trade policy. Her contributions supported strategies that continue to drive economic vitality across the Inland Empire and urban economies nationwide.

In 2021, Mayor Warren was invited by President Joe Biden to speak at the White House during the signing of the historic $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Representing local leaders across America, she underscored the importance of federal investment in transportation, water, and broadband infrastructure—critical sectors that power Fontana’s continued growth. 

Her leadership has earned widespread acclaim, including the Helen Putnam Award of Excellence, the California Health Champion Award, and honors from the California Center for Public Health. (Updated awards list to be added upon receipt.)
