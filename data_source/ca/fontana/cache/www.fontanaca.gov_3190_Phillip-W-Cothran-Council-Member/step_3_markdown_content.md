[Email Phillip W. Cothran](mailto:pwcothran@fontana.org)

Phillip Cothran was elected in 2018 as a City Council Member in the City of Fontana. Mr. Cothran was born and raised in the City of Fontana. He started volunteering in Fontana at the age of 14 when he was accepted into the Fontana Police Explorers Post 531. After spending six years and rising to the rank of captain, Mr. Cothran was awarded the Fontana Community Youth Hero award for his work with the Fontana Police Explorer program. 

Council member Cothran went on to achieve his Bachelors Degree in Business Administration from California Baptist University. While in school, he worked for his local family business, gaining more knowledge of the community while investing in an organization that helps the city prosper. He is a proud supporter of the Fontana Boys and Girls Club and Relay for Life. 

Mr. Cothran sits as an active board member of the Miss Fontana pageant – an organization that helps local youth build confidence in their education and work life abilities. He is also a board member of The Rotary Club of Fontana, a member of the Fontana Chamber of Commerce, and a California Baptist University Robert K. Jabbs School of Business Alumni board member. 

Mr. Cothran earned his Masters in Business Administration. He understands the importance of career readiness. Whether it’s guiding a child to a path of higher education, or one of vocational training, every child deserves to be able to pick a path that is right for them and be given the opportunity for success at every corner. He plans to help build Fontana’s future from within. 

In 2015, he opened his own small business in Fontana. He pledges himself to be a voice for his fellow business owners and will continue to strive to make the City of Fontana the best place to do business.

Fontana is a growing community that should partner with its fellow agencies. He plans on working with the local utility agencies to keep Fontana moving forward. From working on the continued development of our local sewer and waste systems to determining ways to keep our local cost down by implementing a recycled water program throughout the city, Mr. Cothran is aiming to keep Fontana in the future. 

Council member Cothran is married to his college sweetheart, and as of 2018, a proud parent two children. He wants his children to grow up with the same great memories of the City of Fontana as he has!
