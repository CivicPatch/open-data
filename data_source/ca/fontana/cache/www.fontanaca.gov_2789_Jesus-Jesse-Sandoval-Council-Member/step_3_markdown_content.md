Jesse Sandoval, a resident of the City of Fontana since 1967, was elected to the Fontana City Council in November 2012. He was re-elected to a four-year term in 2016, 2020 and 2024.

Mr. Sandoval was appointed to the California Contract Cities Association (CCCA) Legislative Committee in June 2024. 

In the years that Mr. Sandoval has lived in Fontana, he has seen the city grow from a steel-mill town into a thriving community. Jesse has a long history of community involvement. Prior to being elected, Jesse worked for the Fontana Unified School District for 20 years and is currently retired from the City of San Bernardino after 17 years of service. During his years at the City of San Bernardino, he maintained the San Bernardino Baseball Stadium and was honored with the 2002 award for “Best Field in the State of California.”

While working at Fontana School District, Jesse developed a reputation of being an active parent and was involved in the School Site Council and various Parent Teacher Associations (PTA’s). Mr. Sandoval helped establish a Parent-Teacher-Student Association (PTSA) at Sequoia Middle School upon learning that none had existed previously.

Jesse’s community service activities included being a Commissioner on the City of Fontana’s Park and Recreation Commission. Jesse has been a member of the League of California Cities Community Services Policy Committee since 2016 and was appointed to the League of California Cities Governance, Transparency and Labor Relations Policy Committee by the Latino Caucus president in 2021.

Jesse is a sponsor of the annual Veteran’s Day Essay Contest and a coach of youth athletics. Mr. Sandoval has been active with such organizations as Southwest Little League, Fontana Pop Warner Football, Junior All-American Football, and Fontana Girls Softball.

Jesse is committed to keeping Fontana moving forward in a positive way, focusing his efforts on public safety, city programs and senior services. Jesse promises in all things to (1) have an open door policy; (2) keep an open mind; and (3) lend a listening ear to all community concerns.

Mr. Sandoval served as a police volunteer for twenty-plus years and a Parks and Community Services Commissioner for two years. He currently serves on the City of Fontana’s Community Foundation, Housing Authority, Fire Protection District, Industrial Development Authority, Public Financing Authority, Successor Agency and Public Facilities Financing Authority.

Jesse has been married for 35 years to his wife Mary and is proud to have raised their 3 children; Jesus Jr., Maria Teresa, and Maria Cecelia, in the City of Fontana. Mr. Sandoval has five grandkids that are his pride and joy.
