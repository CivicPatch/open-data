# Mayor Valerie Amezcua

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/proudcity/santaanaca/uploads/2023/02/Valerie-Amezcua-2022-Portrait-Compressed.jpg)

Mayor Valerie Amezcua made history in 2022 as the first woman elected Mayor of Santa Ana, marking a significant milestone in the city’s 155-year history. With a strong commitment to addressing homelessness, enhancing public safety, improving the quality of life, and fostering equitable economic development, Mayor Amezcua’s leadership is dedicated to building a brighter future for all Santa Ana residents.

Inspired by her family’s legacy in civic engagement, Mayor Amezcua takes pride in her deep community service roots. Her leadership is driven by a passion for securing a strong future for Santa Ana, building upon its greatest strengths – its location, its history, its pride, and its people. Throughout her career, she has embraced a collaborative leadership style, working to build partnerships that benefit the entire community while honoring the city's rich cultural heritage.

She is a passionate advocate for Santa Ana’s voice on regional boards, including the Orange County Transportation Authority, the Orange County Water District, and the Southern California Association of Governments. As Chair of the Housing and Homelessness Committee for the Association of California Cities - Orange County, she leads regional efforts to address these critical challenges.

With over three decades of service in the Orange County Probation Department, Mayor Amezcua brings unique expertise in public safety, community intervention programs, and addressing gang prevention, domestic violence, and sex crimes investigations. Prior to becoming Mayor, she served for eight years on the Santa Ana Unified School District Board, where she focused on improving graduation rates, campus safety, and educational equity, including five years as President or Vice President.

Mayor Amezcua is a proud product of the Santa Ana community, and she holds a degree from the University of La Verne and a certificate in Family Engagement in Education from the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Her dedication to public service has earned her numerous accolades, including being named 2022 Woman of the Year by the National Hispanic Business Women’s Association and one of Orange County’s 100 Most Influential People by the Orange County Register.

**Mayor Valerie Amezcua’s Vision for Santa Ana:**

"As a mother, wife, and proud third-generation Santa Ana resident, my commitment to our city runs deep. Every decision I make is guided by one question: How does this help our families thrive? I believe in a Santa Ana that honors our hardworking roots while creating new opportunities – where our historic neighborhoods flourish, our students dream bigger, and every resident sees themselves in our city’s bright future.

My administration is focused on:

- **Creating good-paying jobs** by supporting local entrepreneurs and attracting innovative employers
- **Ensuring our neighborhoods remain safe, vibrant, and affordable**
- **Delivering quality education** that prepares students for tomorrow's careers
- **Honoring our rich history** while writing Santa Ana's next great chapter

From my 30 years in public service to my historic election as your mayor, one truth guides me: Santa Ana's greatest strength is its people. Together, we are building more than a city - we're creating a legacy of opportunity that will make our children and grandchildren proud.

This is more than my vision - it's our shared promise. Because when we invest in our communities, protect what makes us special, and believe in Santa Ana's future, there's no limit to what we can achieve. Together, we will not just preserve the Santa Ana we love, we will build the Santa Ana our children deserve."
