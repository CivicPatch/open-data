## **![The Santa Ana City Council stands in front of a wooden dais.](https://storage.googleapis.com/proudcity/santaanaca/2016/01/City-Council-group-photo-scaled.jpg)About the City Council**

The Santa Ana City Council has seven members: a Mayor and six councilmembers. Councilmembers are elected from different parts of the city called wards. They serve four-year terms and have a limit of three terms. 

The Mayor is elected citywide and can serve up to four 2-year terms. A Mayor Pro Tem is chosen from the councilmembers through nomination and election. If the Mayor is absent, the Mayor Pro Tem serves in their place.

### **Meetings**

[City Council meetings](https://www.santa-ana.org/agendas-and-minutes) are on the first and third Tuesdays of each month. There are two parts to each meeting:

1. Closed session at a time between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. (private)
2. Public meeting around 5:30 p.m. (open to the public)

Meetings are in the Council Chamber at 22 Civic Center Plaza and streamed online. If the location changes, it will say so on the agenda.

### **Wards**

The City of Santa Ana has six areas called wards. The Mayor represents the whole city, while the six councilmembers each represent one ward.

Each ward has a similar number of residents. The [ward map](https://www.santa-ana.org/city-council-ward-map) can change every decade to reflect population changes. 

### **Elections**

Local elections are held every two years: to elect a mayor and to elect three councilmembers. While the mayoral seat is up for election every two years, either the council seats for wards 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 6 are up for election every two years (this is called a “sequence”). For the 2024 election, the council seats for wards 1, 3, and 5 will be up for election. In 2026, there will be another election for wards 2, 4, and 6.
