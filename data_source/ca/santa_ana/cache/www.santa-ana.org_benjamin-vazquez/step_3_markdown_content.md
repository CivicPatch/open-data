# Mayor Pro Tem Benjamin Vazquez – Ward 2

![Headshot of Councilmember Benjamin Vazquez](https://storage.googleapis.com/proudcity/santaanaca/2025/05/Benjamin-Vazquez-2025-Portrait-240x300-1.jpg)Mayor Pro Tem Vazquez is a teacher at Valley High School, a cultural worker at El Centro Cultural de México, and a proud homeowner in the Heninger Park neighborhood. Mayor Pro Tem Vazquez is fully invested in his community and in the future of Santa Ana. He was born to working class immigrant parents and was raised on Center Street. Mayor Pro Tem Vazquez attended Santa Ana Unified School District schools, Santa Ana College, earned a Bachelor's degree at Cal State Long Beach, and a Master's degree from UCLA. Mayor Pro Tem Vazquez is now proudly working alongside four siblings and two nieces at Santa Ana Unified School District. Giving back to Santa Ana youth and community is not just his passion—it is a shared family goal.

As a member of the City Council, Mayor Pro Tem Vazquez's focus will be on making sure our limited citywide resources benefit working class families and improve quality of life for all Santa Ana residents. Our City budgets, policies, and resources need to be centered on nurturing the families and communities of our city, instead of special interest groups. Mayor Pro Tem Vazquez believes that our City's plan and budgets need to reflect a vision that prioritizes working class families. On Jan. 21, 2025, he was unanimously elected by the City Council to serve a one-year term as Mayor Pro Tem.
