### San Marcos Council Member María Nuñez![Headshot of Councilmember Maria Nuñez](https://www.san-marcos.net/home/showpublishedimage/15342/638695022635770000)

María Nuñez has served on the San Marcos City Council since November 2018.

A resident of San Marcos and District 1 for nearly 40 years, María attended Alvin Dunn Elementary (now La Mirada Academy), San Marcos Elementary, San Marcos Middle School (formerly Junior High), and went on to graduate from San Marcos High School in 1991.

After receiving an associate’s degree from Palomar College, María earned her bachelor’s degree from California State University San Marcos and a law degree from California Western School of Law. She is also a member of the California Bar.

As a small business owner and community advocate, María brings more than two decades of experience in service and leadership to the City of San Marcos and has spent her life as an advocate for her family and for her community.

She currently serves as immediate past president for the San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association and the organization’s scholarship foundation. María is an advisor for Universidad Popular of San Diego County, and former board member for MANA de San Diego North County, a non-profit Latina mentorship organization.

María’s top goal as an incoming City Council Member for District 1 is to improve the quality of life for residents living within the district she represents. She is committed to connecting District 1 residents to their local government, helping families become civically engaged and facilitating participation in local decision-making.

In addition to serving on the San Marcos City Council, María owns Nuñez Law Corporation, a firm focused on helping individuals and small businesses file bankruptcy and litigate disputes; serving both as plaintiff and defense counsel. She believes that being an attorney is not just a job, but a responsibility and privilege to be an integral part of the legal system.

In her free time, María enjoys hiking with her two dogs, Leonardo and Sebastian, at one of the many San Marcos trails.
