Tyron Hampton

A commitment to Pasadena residents through facilitating access to city resources and departments, relationship building, and an amplified voice is what Councilmember Tyron Hampton pledged and delivers to the people of Pasadena. His promise to strengthen the First District, and in turn strengthen the City, is fueled by his personal connection to the city he has always called home.

All residents and stakeholders, from the youngest to the eldest, are important to Tyron. He has successfully collaborated to establish youth programs such as the “Get in the Swim” program offered at the Rose Bowl Aquatics Center to Washington Multilingual STEAM Multilingual Academy students, and the “Field Trip to the Field” program offered to all seventh-grade students in PUSD at Rose Bowl Stadium. These programs offer access, exposure, and opportunities to young people. Tyron has facilitated numerous young people obtaining their first work/internship experiences in the City. For Pasadena’s senior population, Tyron has advocated for PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) centers. PACE centers make it possible for seniors to lessen social isolation and to keep living on their homes which is often meaningful to seniors and their families.

Since first being elected to the City Council in 2015, Tyron has continuously engaged with residents of the First District through neighborhood walks, community meetings (in-person and virtual), and district events such as his annual Pancake Breakfast Block Party &amp; Community Meeting at Brookside. Tyron works tirelessly to ensure that the First District is the safest district to call home in the City of Pasadena. He encourages neighbors to communicate with him and with each other because consistent communication among neighbors strengthens neighborhoods. He champions traffic improvement efforts throughout the First District that make the district safer for everyone. Tyron advocates for significant improvements to amenities located in the First District that contribute to enhanced quality of life for residents.

In addition to representing the First District on the City Council, Tyron serves on the following City Council committees, advisory boards, and commissions:

- Economic Development &amp; Technology/ED Tech Committee (Chair)
- Municipal Services Committee
- Public Safety Committee
- Foothill Employment &amp; Training Consortium Policy Board
- Pasadena Center Operating Company/PCOC (Chair)
- Gamble House Board of Overseers
- Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority

Tyron served as the City’s Vice Mayor from May 2019 to December 2020. In March 2020, Tyron was elected to represent the First District on the City Council for a second term.

Winning his first election in 2013, Tyron served as a board member for the Pasadena Unified School District (PUSD). During his tenure on the school board, Tyron leveraged the skills he has acquired as a local business owner to improve communication between school board members and families as he sought and found innovative solutions to overcome budget shortfalls. As a PUSD board member, Tyron championed the introduction of Wi-Fi into all PUSD schools, created a PUSD newsletter, worked on the creation of STEAM magnet programs, increased science and technology resources at the elementary level, brought college-focused programs to the district, implemented campus physical inspections for repairs, and supported various other initiatives that brought positive change to the PUSD. Tyron attended schools in the Pasadena Unified School District throughout his K-12 years. After graduating from John Muir High School, Tyron obtained a bachelor’s degree from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.

Tyron stems from a family of entrepreneurs. For more than a decade, he has run a commercial floor covering business. Tyron is married to his high school sweetheart, Tara Gomez-Hampton, Ph.D., who is an alumnus of California Institute of Technology. Tyron and Tara have two daughters, Peyton and Pria, and a host of nieces and nephews. Outside of work and service on the City Council, Tyron enjoys spending time with family and is an avid fitness enthusiast.
