Councilmember Michael Inzunza, a dedicated Chula Vista native, represents District 3 with a steadfast commitment to public service, education, and community development. His deep roots in the city where he was born inspire his dedication to building a safer, stronger, and more vibrant community for all residents.

Michael began his career as an educator, teaching at Palomar and Hilltop High Schools, where his passion for youth development and education flourished. His leadership and advocacy led to his appointment as a Commissioner for Children, Youth &amp; Families by the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, where he oversaw foster youth programs, adoption services, and child welfare initiatives.

Michael’s experience in regional governance expanded during his tenure as District Director for Supervisor Greg Cox, managing key areas including Chula Vista, Bonita, San Ysidro, and National City. He played a pivotal role in connecting local communities with resources and implementing programs to improve residents’ quality of life. Returning to his roots in education, Michael served as an ASB Dean and Assistant Principal, mentoring students and fostering leadership opportunities. Today, he works with the California School Boards Association, advocating for increased funding and essential resources to strengthen schools across the region.

Michael’s leadership emphasizes supporting local businesses and economic growth. He is a strong advocate for small businesses, working to create policies that foster a business-friendly environment and drive economic opportunity in District 3. Looking to the future, Michael envisions the creation of a new university that will bring expanded educational opportunities, innovation, and well-paying jobs to the community.

Michael is equally committed to enhancing parks and open spaces, ensuring families have access to clean, safe, and vibrant recreational areas that enrich the city’s neighborhoods. His focus on infrastructure improvements, traffic flow, and maintaining Chula Vista’s natural beauty reflects his vision for a thriving and connected community.

Michael and his wife, Alejandra, have been married for nearly 20 years and are proud parents of children who attend Olympian High School. When he’s not serving the community, Michael enjoys spending time with his family, exploring Chula Vista’s parks and beaches, and supporting local businesses.

Councilmember Michael Inzunza brings experience, dedication, and a clear vision for Chula Vista’s future. His leadership is defined by his commitment to serving District 3 residents and ensuring every family has the opportunity to thrive in a safe and dynamic community.
