As a teacher for over twenty years, Cesar Fernandez is in the heart of our community every day, making a direct impact improving the lives of the people he serves. He brings that same passion and commitment everyday to City Hall.

Cesar manages the after-school programs that care for Chula Vista’s young people and makes sure they have safe, engaging, and enjoyable learning opportunities after the last bell. From skateboarding to e-sports, athletics to performing arts, Cesar’s programs are keeping kids off the streets and on the path to success. He's turning after-school and out-of-school time into meaningful opportunities for learning and growth.

On Chula Vista Elementary School District’s School Board, Cesar ensured students and families were cared for, securing healthy food, access to internet services, the basics. He knows that caring for our kids means more than just teaching them math and reading. It's about making sure they have everything they need to succeed, both in and out of the classroom. Cesar’s work has made a real difference in the lives of Chula Vista’s students and families.

At City Hall, Cesar will fight for what the community cares about — high wage jobs, public safety, and Southwest Chula Vista’s fair share of resources for the region. He's ready to help address concerns at the top and get things done. Cesar’s unquestionable track record of leadership has shown he’s the leader Chula Vista can truly count on.
