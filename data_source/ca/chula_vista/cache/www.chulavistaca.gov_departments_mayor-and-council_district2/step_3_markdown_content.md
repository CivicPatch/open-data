Councilmember Jose Preciado was elected to the City Council on November 8, 2022, to represent District 2. Jose serves as the voting member of Metro Wastewater, J.P.A., as an alternate at SANDAG, and the Chula Vista Bayfront Infrastructure, JPA. Jose is a member of the following council ad hoc committees- Chula Vista/University Partnerships, 3rd Avenue Development, and City Charter Review.

Jose is a lifelong resident of San Diego’s South Bay where he attended Nestor Elementary, Southwest Middle School and Southwest High School. He earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Latin American Studies and Spanish For the Single Subject Credential and a Master of Arts in Teaching from San Diego State University (SDSU).  

In his 26th year of service with San Diego State University, Jose serves as the Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Studies. This leadership role is primarily responsible for course-based campus initiatives in support of undergraduate student success and academic achievement.  In addition, Jose directs the Faculty-Student Mentoring Program, the Academic Internship Program and the Supplemental Instruction Center. Jose has been an active member of the SDSU campus community serving on the University Senate and as a steward with Academic Professional of California. Jose is also a dues-paying member of the California Faculty Association. 

Jose moved to West Chula Vista in 2006 and was elected in 2008 as Director of the South Bay Irrigation District/Sweetwater Authority-Division 3.  During his 14-year tenure, Jose served as Chair of the Board of Directors and he chaired or was member of several committees including:  the Finance and Administration Committee, the Consultant Selection Committee and the Engineering, Development and Capital Infrastructure Committee.  In 2015, Jose was appointed by his fellow directors as the South Bay Irrigation District representative to San Diego County Water Authority. There, Jose chaired the Water Resource and Environmental Planning Committee and served as a member of the Engineering Committee, Legislative and Outreach Committee, Imported Water Committee, the Colorado River Taskforce and as an alternate on the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) Borders Committee.

Serving the community has been his priority and he is a recognized regional advocate promoting high quality public schools in every neighborhood, access to higher education including a four-year university for Chula Vista, increasing housing options for working families and seniors, and expanding civic participation to improve the quality of life for all residents. He was  a member and President of the Board of Directors of CSA San Diego (a nonprofit fair housing organization), past-President of the South Bay Forum (a member-driven organization engaged in public policy issues impacting the South Bay region), and co-founder and longstanding club officer of the Chula Vista Democratic Club.

Jose lives behind Hilltop High School in the Windsor Heights community with his brother, Sergio. Jose is an avid listener of podcasts and audiobooks, enjoys supporting Chula Vista’s local restaurants and small businesses, he is a proud and involved uncle, and he looks forward to weekly family gatherings to catch up on the latest happenings with his nieces and nephews.
