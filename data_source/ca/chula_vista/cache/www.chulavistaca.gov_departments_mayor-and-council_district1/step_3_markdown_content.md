Deputy Mayor Carolina Chavez, a devoted public servant and lifelong resident of the Cali-Baja region, is the first Latina and binational council member to represent Chula Vista’s District 1. With a profound dedication to cross-border cooperation and community development, she brings years of extensive experience in promoting collaboration, particularly in business and economic policies. 

As the former two-term chair of the International Business Association Committee at the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce, and current Chula Vista representative on both the South County Economic Development Committee, San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) and on the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) Board of Directors, Deputy Mayor Chavez plays a pivotal role in shaping regional international relations, business and economic policies. 

Deputy Mayor Chavez's commitment to community service is evident through her active participation in various non-profit endeavors, from supporting at-risk youth and championing educational opportunities via scholarships, to coordinating food and clothing donations, and facilitating medical access and assistance in vulnerable communities. Actively engaging with local, state, and federal governments on both sides of the border, she is a strong advocate for the expansion of public health access in the binational region. 

From her journalistic roots to her current role, Deputy Mayor Chavez's leadership and vision have consistently driven positive change, cultivating a thriving community in this dynamic and diverse region.
