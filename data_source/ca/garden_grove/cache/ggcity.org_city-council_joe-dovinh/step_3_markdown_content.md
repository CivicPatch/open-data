In April 1975, his family was evacuated from war-torn central Vietnam during the “Fall of Saigon” as part of the first-wave of evacuees. Processed as refugees through the United States Marine Base Camp Pendleton in San Diego, California, his family was subsequently sponsored by a judge’s family to Washington state where he grew up.

Council Member DoVinh attended the University of Washington, earning a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science while serving as president of the Vietnamese Student Association, from 1989 to 1990. He was also director of the Asian Commission of the Associated Students of University of Washington (ASUW). After graduating from the University of Washington, Council Member DoVinh passed the State of Washington Certified Interpreter Exam and served as an interpreter for state and federal courts.
