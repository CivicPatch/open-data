### ![](https://www.cityofirvine.org/sites/default/files/file-repository/CM%20Liu_5x7.jpg)

Councilmember Melinda Liu is a long-time Northwood resident with her multigenerational family in Irvine. She holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from the University of California in Berkeley and a Juris Doctor degree from Southwestern University School Law in Los Angeles, California. Professionally, she is a licensed attorney by the California Bar, a licensed Real Estate Broker in the State of California, and a certified Mediator. Born in Taipei, Taiwan, Councilmember Liu moved to Los Angeles with her family as a teenager. In Irvine’s first district City Council election, she made history as the first Taiwan-born Chinese-American woman who is fluent in Mandarin to be elected to Irvine City Council.

Throughout her legal career, Councilmember Liu has worked extensively with immigrant communities and small businesses. She started working in immigration law during law school under the mentorship of prominent immigration attorneys. Then, she gained insights and experiences serving small businesses in transactions, litigations, and complex government regulations in private practice and the Small Business Administration. Currently, Councilmember Liu runs her solo estate planning business where she helps families make estate plans with empathy and knowledge.

Since high school, Councilmember Liu has been an active community volunteer and leader who’s been recognized by many organizations. A passionate advocate for her community, Councilmember Liu has spent years acting as a volunteer and leader at local athletic, education, and charitable organizations. Specifically, she served as the President of Irvine Chinese School Parent Teacher Organization, Board Member of Northwood High School Athletic Booster Club and PTSA, and a volunteer mediator at the Orange County Superior Court.

In her family life, Councilmember Liu has been the caretaker for her elderly parents and has raised three outstanding young adult children. She also has been managing her parents’ financial and healthcare affairs. Having been the caretaker of her elderly immigrant parents and her young children, Councilmember Liu understands the tasks involved for the “sandwich generation” and the needs necessary for a family to thrive.

Councilmember Liu strives to serve the community by fostering business opportunities, protecting quality of life, and focusing on safety and education for children. Equipped with legal expertise and decades of experience from working with Irvine residents, Councilmember Liu will continue her public service to bring practical solutions and responsible governance to create an equitable, inclusive, and vibrant community to all Irvine residents.
