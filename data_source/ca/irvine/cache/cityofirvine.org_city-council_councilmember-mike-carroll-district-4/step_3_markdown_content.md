## Meet Councilmember Mike Carroll [District 4](https://cityofirvine.org/city-council/councilmember-mike-carroll-district-4/)

[Email Councilmember Carroll(link sends e-mail)](mailto:MikeCarroll@cityofirvine.org)

![](https://www.cityofirvine.org/sites/default/files/City%20Council/2024/Mike%20Carroll_with%20pin_600px.jpg)

Councilmember Mike Carroll is serving his second 4-year term on the Irvine City Council. Appointed in 2019 on a bi-partisan basis to fill a vacancy, in 2020 he was elected to a four-year term and then re-elected in 2024, where he received the highest number of votes in the City’s history.

With over 318,000 residents, Irvine is the second largest city in Orange County, California, the sixth largest county in the United States. Irvine is a multi-award-winning master-planned community. It is the most diversely integrated city and has been the safest city in America for nearly 20 years in a row.

Carroll is also Chairman of the Great Park, the largest under-development municipal park in the nation. Spanning 1,300 acres and hosting 6 million annual visits, the Great Park’s 500 acres completed to date embrace recreation, competitive sports, parkland, and the environment. As a salute to our veterans, the Great Park honors the memory of the former Marine Corps Air Station El Toro. The Great Park is setting the gold standard for park design, and upon completion, it will be a national treasure among the great metropolitan parks of the world.

Carroll is also the Chairman of the Irvine Hotel Improvement District, which governs the second largest hotel and hospitality footprint in Orange County. He is also a Board Member of the Orange County Transportation Authority, a $2.3 billion organization responsible for all aspects of freeway, rail, and bus transportation development in Orange County.

Previously, Carroll served on the Board of the Irvine Community Land Trust, which provides affordable housing, and the Irvine Planning and Community Services Commissions, where he served as Vice Chairman and Chairman, respectively. He also served as a Board Member of the Orange County Press Club, OneOC (Volunteer Center of Orange County), and Child Aid, and was the President of the Vista Verde K-8 School Foundation. Carroll is the recipient of the *President’s Volunteer Service Award* for his pro bono representation of the Orange County Rescue Mission’s Village of Hope, a transitional housing facility for young families.

Carroll is a practicing corporate, M&amp;A, and transactional attorney. Prior to establishing his own practice, he was General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer of a NASDAQ-traded public company and practiced corporate and securities law at a major international law firm in New York. In 2009, he was named to *OC Metro’s 40 Under 40*. He is a *New York Times* bestselling author published by *HarperCollins Publishers* and has appeared on the *NBC Today Show*, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, and NPR.

Carroll lives in Irvine with his wife and two daughters. When he is not serving in the community,

he enjoys going on family adventures, reading American history, and exploring Irvine’s Open Space trails.
