Councilmember Betty Martinez Franco is a proud, longtime resident of Irvine, an entrepreneur, and a public servant representing Council District 5. In a historic victory, she became the first Latina and first Mexican immigrant elected to the Irvine City Council, in a city where Latinos represent the third-largest demographic group.

Originally from Mexico, Councilmember Martinez Franco immigrated to the United States over 30 years ago. Her journey is one of determination and perseverance, beginning with humble roots working in apple fields, hotel housekeeping, and childcare. As a survivor of domestic violence, she sought refuge at Human Options. This nonprofit organization helped her secure stable and affordable housing in Irvine –– where she began to rebuild her life with her two daughters.

Betty’s determination led her to pursue higher education options. She earned an Associate's degree from Orange Coast College, a Bachelor’s degree in Communications from California State University, Fullerton, a Master’s degree in Public Administration, and a Graduate Certificate in City and County Management from USC Price School of Public Policy.

She is the founder and CEO of Prisma Communications, a multicultural public relations firm specializing in culturally competent communications and civic engagement campaigns. Her work has elevated minority-owned businesses, supported Fortune 500 initiatives, and advanced equity-driven storytelling across California. Her firm is recognized for its commitment to inclusion and impact on underserved communities.

Prior to serving on the City Council, Betty spent nearly three years as a member of Irvine’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee, where she championed inclusive city policies. She is a founding board member of the Hispanic Public Relations Association – OC Chapter, an active National Latina Business Women Association–Los Angeles board member, and an ambassador for the Orange County Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. She has organized numerous events that amplify Latina entrepreneurship, civic leadership, and youth mentorship.

As an elected official, Councilmember Martinez Franco is focused on:

- Affordable housing access and responsible urban growth
- Support for small businesses and economic development
- Community engagement and inclusive policy making
- Public safety and neighborhood well-being

She brings a unique lived experience and a strategic, compassionate approach to governance. Betty Martinez Franco passionately advocates for equity, cultural representation, and meaningful public services, ensuring that every voice in Irvine District 5 is heard and valued.
