## **Louie Rocha**

### Mayor Pro Tem

![Council Member Louis Rocha](https://www.antiochca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/l-rocha.png)

Louie Rocha was elected to the Antioch City Council for District 2 and officially assumed office in December 2024.

Louie Rocha, a lifelong resident of Antioch, has spent more than 50 years shaping the future of his community. After attending local schools—including Antioch High School, where he graduated in 1979—Louie pursued higher education, first earning an Associate of Fire Science degree at Los Medanos Community College in 1982 and bachelor’s degree in psychology from San Diego State University in 1985.

With a commitment to youth empowerment, Louie began his career as a counselor at REACH Project Inc., providing education, counseling, and intervention for at-risk students at Park Junior High School. His dedication earned him the Community Services Award from the Parent, Teacher, Student Association in 1989. Determined to deepen his impact, he earned a masters degree in educational leadership from Saint Mary’s College in 1992, as well as California education credentials in School Administration and Pupil Services.Louie’s career with Antioch Unified School District began in 1996, where he served as a school guidance counselor at Prospects High School, later advancing to Vice Principal in 1999 and ultimately Principal of Antioch High School in 2006. During his tenure, he spearheaded the passage of a $56.5 million bond to modernize the historic high school to a 21st Century High School introducing cutting-edge technology and implementing the Small Learning Community and Linked Learning model. This initiative provided students with the 3 R’s of Rigor, Relevance, Relationships via a career-connected education in small learning academies with a focus on Engineering, Media Technology, Environmental Studies and Leadership. In response to social emotional support for a diverse student body, he developed and implemented a CARE Team model that provided on-site mental health counseling services, mobile health clinic, food bank, clothing pantry and after school programs for all students. He worked in collaboration with school counselors and teachers to create a referral system for at-risk students to the CARE Team of service providers who matched services to student needs. Louie ‘s vision earned him numerous accolades, including the Cesar Chavez Educator Award in 2016, Association of California School Administrators (ACSA) Principal of the Year for Contra Costa County in 2017, and honored by the House of Representatives with a Congressional Record for his educational leadership as Principal of Antioch School for 16 years from Congressman Mark DeSaulnier in 2022. In retirement, Louie has continued to serve Antioch as Program Coordinator of Antioch Sports Legends Museum and Executive Board member of the Antioch Community Foundation. In November 2024, he was elected to the Antioch City Council for District 2 and as Mayor Pro Tem where he brings his lifelong passion for community service to city governance.
