### Council Member

![mayor pro-tem Tamisha Torres-Walker](https://www.antiochca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tamisha-torres-walker.png)

Tamisha Torres-Walker assumed the role of Antioch City Council Member for District 1 in December 2020. She was re-elected in November 2022 to a 4-year term.

Tamisha Torres-Walker, a distinguished member of the Antioch City Council, is a visionary leader and dedicated advocate with a profound commitment to fostering the reintegration and empowerment of formerly incarcerated and convicted individuals. She serves as the co-founder and current Executive Director of the Safe Return Project, a prominent organization in Contra Costa County, with a steadfast mission to secure the freedom and liberation of those who have been ensnared in the criminal justice system. Tamisha’s tenure is marked by her unrelenting dedication to participatory action research and grassroots organizing, driven by a resolute ambition to eradicate mass incarceration and the unjust criminalization of impoverished communities.

Since her release from incarceration in 2009, Tamisha Torres-Walker has been an unwavering community organizer, tirelessly championing the cause of mass incarceration reform and combating the pervasive racial disparities that afflict the criminal justice system. Her personal experience with incarceration, disenfranchisement, and the transformative journey to post-criminalization healing have galvanized her resolve to effect meaningful change. With over fourteen years of community organizing experience in areas plagued by trauma and economic inequality, her expertise encompasses professional training in research and advocacy for the formerly incarcerated and their families, as well as the development of violence prevention strategies and conflict mediation programs aimed at reducing urban gun violence. Her academic background is rooted in a bachelor’s degree in psychology from California State University East Bay.

In recognition of her extraordinary contributions, Tamisha Torres-Walker was honored with the San Francisco Robert C. Kirkwood Leadership Award in 2017. This prestigious accolade acknowledged her relentless commitment to investing in people over prisons, and the profound impact her work has had on the lives of thousands who have faced criminalization and are returning to Contra Costa County. In 2018, she was celebrated by The Black Elected Officials of the East Bay during their “Shine” ceremony, which applauds luminaries who exemplify black ingenuity and brilliance. Tamisha was presented with the Community Excellence award in acknowledgment of her remarkable track record, demonstrating excellence in her field and upholding the highest standards of unity, ethical conduct, integrity, and civic and social responsibility.

Tamisha Torres-Walker’s dedication to effecting meaningful change extends to her roles as a Soros Justice Fellow and a Rosenburg Foundations Leading Edge Fund fellow. As a Soros Justice Fellow, she actively worked on transformative narratives strategies to bolster grassroots movements striving for mass liberation and environmental justice. Her involvement as a Rosenburg Foundations Leading Edge Fund fellow was centered on advancing the cause of social justice, with a focus on cultivating a movement of highly skilled formerly incarcerated and convicted leaders dedicated to combating all forms of discrimination based on criminal history.  
In addition to her extraordinary achievements, Tamisha holds multiple board appointments within Contra Costa County, including the Racial Justice Oversight Body, the Juvenile Justice Coordinating Council, the DJJ Realignment committee, the Holistic Intervention Pretrial Committee, and the Richmond Reimagining Public Safety Taskforce. Her contributions to these vital community initiatives underscore her unwavering commitment to driving meaningful change and reform within the criminal justice system.

Tamisha Torres-Walker’s exemplary leadership, unyielding dedication, and substantial accomplishments have left an indelible mark on the field of criminal justice reform and the lives of countless individuals in Contra Costa County. Her relentless pursuit of justice, equity, and the empowerment of marginalized communities remains an inspiration to all who have the privilege of working alongside her.
