Connie Chan

District 1

**Supervisor Connie Chan**

Supervisor Connie Chan represents District 1 on the Board of Supervisors, including the Inner Richmond, Central Richmond, Outer Richmond, Lone Mountain, Golden Gate Park, Lincoln Park, and University of San Francisco. Connie Chan was raised in San Francisco since the age of thirteen, and owes so much to this incredible City. Today, Connie has served our City at every level and understands how policy goals at the top are implemented into operational actions for San Francisco residents.

Born in Hong Kong, she moved to San Francisco at the age of 13 with her mother and younger brother. Her family was able to obtain a rent-controlled apartment in Chinatown (the same apartment her mother lives in today) because her mother was able to develop the skills she needed for a new career, as a claims processor at Chinese Hospital, thanks to classes at City College of San Francisco.

After graduating from Galileo High School, Connie earned her bachelor’s degree from the University of California, Davis and then went to work giving back to the community that had done so much for her family. She started out as a volunteer interpreter, working with pro bono attorneys for SF Bar Association's Volunteer Legal Outreach, while serving as a community organizer for SF SAFE and Community Youth Center.

In 2006, she was recruited to be an aide to Supervisor Sophie Maxwell and later served as an aide to then-District Attorney Kamala Harris, followed by Supervisor Aaron Peskin in 2016. Since then, Connie also served at San Francisco Recreation &amp; Parks and City College of San Francisco.

Connie’s long-time partner became a San Francisco firefighter in 2011 – the same year they bought their home in the Richmond District. Today, they are raising their son who is a public school student in the district.

Connie is honored to serve District 1 residents and her priorities as supervisor will be to ensure the same opportunities San Francisco has given her are available for all San Franciscans now and for generations to come.

## Golden Gate Park Community Benefit Fund

Each year, Another Planet Entertainment pays $35,000 into a Community Benefit Fund for District 1 and District 4 to offset the impact the Outside Lands and Polo Fields concerts have on our communities 

Last year we began a community process to determine how to reinvest this funding into our community. We solicited your feedback through a community survey, presented on the results to the Park Recreation and Open Space Advisory Committee (PROSAC), and used your suggestions to fund community events like our annual Autumn Moon festival, Film Festivals at the Balboa Theatre, nature education programming, neighborhood beautification projects, local elementary school support, and recreation equipment for the Richmond Rec Center. Last year we were able to use previous unspent funds to invest over $110,000. 

This year, we once again solicited community input through a survey to understand how to spend this years $35,000 in funding. We presented on the results of the survey to PROSAC and will be investing into community festivals and nature education. Stay tuned for details of the festivals in the coming weeks! 

## Heart of the Richmond

Last month we kicked off the 2025 Heart of the Richmond Night Market series. It was a beautiful sunny afternoon and evening and I loved seeing so many of you out on Clement.

![](https://image.bos.sfgov.org/lib/fe3b157075640675741775/m/1/71d49a5a-e90c-4ee5-b014-80cefdf979ea.png)

We had delicious food vendors, Richmond District makers and sellers, and fantastic performers. Don't worry, if you didn't make the June market, we have three more coming up!
