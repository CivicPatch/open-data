Shamann Walton

District 10

**Supervisor Shamann Walton**

Supervisor Shamann Walton represents District 10. Shamann was born in San Francisco and lived in public housing at an early age in Bayview and Potrero Hill. He has worked in District 10 neighborhoods for decades

and has witnessed firsthand the challenges our community faces from long-time residents being pushed out of the city to losing childhood friends to violence and incarceration. As an accomplished and experienced community leader, Shamann has dedicated his life to improving these realities in our community and is committed to identifying solutions to our pressing issues. He has a proven track record of creating positive change in the community he serves.

As the former president and member of the San Francisco Board of Education, Shamann spearheaded the effort to close the achievement gap for Black, Latino, and special needs students and helped secure the funding for the school district's first African American Achievement and Leadership Initiative. He worked to protect undocumented students, decreased teacher turnover, increase graduation rates across the district for Black, Latino and Pacific Islander students, secured the financing and identified a site for our first affordable housing units for educators, and fought to make sure that Mission Bay will have its first school built in the next few years.  [READ MORE](https://www.sf.gov/supervisor-shamann-walton-overview)

District 10: June 2025 Updates &amp; Events

![](https://click.bos.sfgov.org/open.aspx?ffcb10-fec1127871660675-fe81127373620d7472-fe2f1570756406757d1277-ff6d157074-fe541576736103747317-ffce15&d=100218&bmt=0)

Dear Neighbors and Community,

I hope you are all doing well!

I know many of you have reached out over the past month with concerns about a few fatal accidents that have happen across the city.  Every life lost is a tragedy, and my deepest condolences go out to the families impacted.

These incidents make it clear that we must remain vigilant in our commitment to street safety for everyone. 

My office has prioritized safety improvements across the district and will continue working to implement traffic calming measures, better lighting, and long-term Vision Zero strategies- especially in communities that have been historically underserved. Everyone deserves safe, equitable streets, free from preventable tragedy. 

Over the past few years there have been about twenty (20) safety projects that have been implemented including but not limited to quick builds, new traffic signals, speed humps, and slow streets.   We currently have twenty (20) more safety improvements in progress across the district and more being reviewed. 

If you have specific questions regarding safety improvements or locations of concern, please do not hesitate to reach out to my office. 

As always, if you have any questions or matters concerning District 10, please email my office at [waltonstaff@sfgov.org](mailto:waltonstaff@sfgov.org?subject=District%2010%20Concern "waltonstaff@sfgov.org"). 

In Community,

*Supervisor Shamann Walton*

**OFFICE OF THE CITY ADMINISTRATOR**

Last November, San Francisco voters approved Proposition E, creating the Commission Streamlining Task Force. The Task Force is charged with reviewing the City’s many appointive boards and commissions and making recommendations to the Mayor and Board of Supervisors on how to modify, eliminate, or consolidate them for more effective, efficient, and economical governance.

The Task Force meets every first and third Wednesday at 1 PM in City Hall room 408 to discuss potential improvements to the structure of City government.

Learn more about the Commission Streamlining Task Force today on its [website](https://click.bos.sfgov.org/?qs=d38b53fea3f329155306f1dec1b6fb9e8cbfa394faeadf0988f4b735a4a8038ebcd5ba506404683ab22fd3eb97f743942aa0951ce9834fe5 "https://www.sf.gov/commission-streamlining-task-force"). Interested members of the public can join the Task Force mailing list or share feedback by emailing [commissionstreamlining@sfgov.org.](mailto:commissionstreamlining@sfgov.org.
