Bilal Mahmood

District 5

 

**Supervisor Bilal Mahmood**

 

Supervisor Bilal Mahmood represents District 5, including the Tenderloin, Hayes Valley, Western Addition, Fillmore, Alamo Square, Japantown, NoPA, and Haight Ashbury.

The son of Pakistani immigrants, he is the first South Asian and Muslim-American elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. His career has spanned civil service, entrepreneurship, and philanthropy, working for over a decade to advance innovative solutions to support issues of public safety, inequality, and climate justice.

After majoring in Biological Sciences at Stanford University and attaining a Gates Scholarship to attend the University of Cambridge, he entered public service in the Obama Administration. As a policy analyst in the US Office of Innovation of Entrepreneurship, he championed policies to support access to capital for small business after the Great Recession. Returning to the Bay Area, he cofounded a software company in San Francisco to democratize access to artificial intelligence technology for small and medium sized businesses.

During the pandemic, Bilal started a community impact fund to invest back in San Francisco. He launched philanthropic campaigns that funded guaranteed income programs for restaurant workers, bystander training for members of the AAPI community, the Let’s Talk About Us campaign to raise awareness for domestic violence, and the Upgrade California campaign to advocate for zero emission buildings. He is also an elected member of the SF Democratic County Central Committee, where he has advanced resolutions calling for innovative solutions to our housing, fentanyl, and public safety crises.

Bilal is a lifelong renter, who currently resides in the Tenderloin. You can often find him working out of the Philz on Golden Gate Ave, grabbing a bite at Gioia Pizza in Hayes Valley, going for a weekend run through the Panhandle, or getting his favorite soft-serve from Cafe Maiko in Japantown.

## Street Safety Investment Priorities Survey

Help us decide where to spend District 5's Neighborhood Transportation Program (NTP) funds! The San Francisco County Transportation Authority (SFCTA) allocates $700,000 to Supervisor district offices to spend on capital and planning projects in the district. This nonbinding survey will help Supervisor Bilal Mahmood and his office learn where constituents are experiencing issues and inform our decisions about where to direct these funds. We will create a shortlist of recommendations that will be reviewed for feasibility and implementation by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA).

Our primary goal with the funding spend will be making streets safer for all road users. These funds will support small projects that can make a big difference in reducing speeding, increasing visibility of pedestrians, and making for safer intersections. Examples of projects that fit these goals are painted safety zones, speed humps/cushions, and raised crosswalks.

The deadline for this survey is **May 30, 2025.**
