# District 7

Welcome to the Official Page of Supervisor Myrna Melgar

District 7

**Supervisor Myrna Melgar**

Supervisor Myrna Melgar represents District 7, was elected District 7 Supervisor in November 2020. As Supervisor, she represents District 7’s diverse communities, including 40 distinct neighborhoods, among them West Portal, Westwood Park, Forest Hill, Parkmerced, Golden Gate Heights, Inner Sunset, St. Francis Woods, Miraloma, and Monterey Heights. Myrna is an urban planner, economic development and housing policy expert, and has served in City government in several different capacities. Myrna is committed to achieving progress that will allow all our City’s people -- including those who have been historically disadvantaged -- to flourish here. Committed to values of progress and equity, Myrna also prizes listening, collaboration, and a pragmatic focus on timely achievement of good results.

Myrna’s family immigrated to San Francisco from El Salvador when she was a child during the 1980s, fleeing that country’s civil war. As for so many others before and since, San Francisco provided Myrna’s family with refuge and economic opportunity. Myrna is fluent in English, Spanish and French, and speaks Swedish proficiently. She attended San Francisco State University and graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Liberal Arts from Excelsior College. She holds a Master’s degree in Urban Planning with a concentration in housing development from Columbia University.

Myrna formerly worked as the Executive Director of the Jamestown Community Center, Deputy Director of the Mission Economic Development Agency, Director of Homeownership Programs at the Mayor’s Office of Housing during the Newsom Administration, and served as President of the City Planning Commission and Vice President of the Building Inspection Commission. Her legislative priorities include reducing homelessness; increasing the availability of affordable housing and homeownership opportunities for San Franciscans; improving rent control protections for tenants; supporting small businesses, supporting the rights of workers, improving our public transportation infrastructure, reducing our city’s carbon footprint and expanding education opportunities for disadvantaged San Francisco youth and families. Myrna’s priorities also include improving the Westside’s access to senior services, pedestrian, bicycle and transportation improvements throughout District 7 and supporting the safety and resilience of neighborhoods and commercial corridors.

Myrna has also served on the Board of Directors of many San Francisco nonprofit human service organizations. When not working on community issues, Myrna enjoys gardening and cooking. She is a lover and supporter of the performing arts, plays the flute and renaissance recorders, loves classical and folk music and is a dedicated Samba dancer. Myrna, her husband Sean Donahue, and three daughters have made their home in Ingleside Terraces for the past decade.

Dear Neighbors,

Happy July everyone! I hope that everyone had a joyous and safe 4th of July with their loved ones. We also have many exciting updates for you this month, including the winners of this year’s Participatory Budgeting election. July is also Disability Pride Month and this year we will be celebrating the 35th anniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act. So this July, I encourage you to learn more about the champions of disability rights in your communities and find your own way to celebrate their contributions. 

Sincerely,

Myrna Melgar

**LEGISLATIVE &amp; PROJECT UPDATES**  
 

**Budget Updates**

On July 15, the Board of Supervisors will vote on a finalized annual budget. Facing an $800 million two year shortfall, we managed to reduce layoffs, retain homeless prevention and shelter, as well public safety measures like a fully funded police force and community ambassadors. Additionally, the City set aside $400M in preparation for potential federal cuts to vital services for San Francisco. In this difficult budget and political environment we are glad that we have been able to protect many essential services and workers.

In District 7, Supervisor Melgar fought to retain participatory budgeting and reversed some cuts to our senior connector hubs. This was a difficult budget year, but Supervisor Melgar is committed to ensuring that the needs of her constituents on the west side are met, and will continue to fight for you in the next budget cycle.

**2025 Participatory Budgeting Results**

We are so excited to announce the winning projects that will be getting funded for this year’s Participatory Budgeting cycle! 

This year’s winners:

- Median improvements in Monterey Heights
- New curb ramps in Westwood Park
- Update Playground and black top at West Portal Elementary School
- Mural on Monterey Boulevard
- Mural and Signage updates at Commodore Sloat Elementary
- Sidewalk repair in Ingleside Terraces
- Daylighting and bollards in Sunnyside

Even if your project did not win, we value your engagement with your community and encourage you to apply again next year. Thank you to everyone who voted or applied. We are looking forward to seeing these improvements get completed.

**UCSF and Blue Shield Reach Agreement to**  
**Protect Healthcare Access**

We are happy to report that UC Health and Blue Shield of California have reached an agreement to continue their partnership, ensuring uninterrupted access to care at UCSF. Blue Shield’s initial decision to drop UCSF had left many retirees, employees, and constituents deeply concerned about their health coverage. In response, Supervisors Dorsey and Melgar partnered on a resolution introduced at the Board of Supervisors meeting, urging both parties to find a resolution. We are pleased that this advocacy helped support a successful outcome that protects the healthcare access so many citizens deserve. 

**Brotherhood Way Safety and Circulation Plan**

![](https://image.bos.sfgov.org/lib/fe391570756406747d1571/m/1/ab962d47-c16f-4622-9ecf-394be48eca04.jpg)

Next steps are underway for the [Brotherhood Way Safety and Circulation Plan](https://click.bos.sfgov.org/?qs=d13d7f8ce2fd18e908925b87f0527ff0bba145c53730aaece981346d633c83348304aaa3b86cf8ff50f6635c1850ed44a73286f4d7b2c35d), which aims to improve safety, traffic flow, and neighborhood connections for everyone who walks, rolls, bikes, or drives along Brotherhood Way, Alemany Boulevard, and nearby streets.

Starting July 9, the SF County Transportation Authority will share three proposals with the public at a series of upcoming meetings. This plan, along with the SFMTA's Brotherhood-Alemany Safety Project, will help inform decisions about the future of the city-owned open space at Brotherhood Way and Orizaba Avenue — a possible site for the new Ocean View Library. Learn more about the plan and how to share your feedback [here](https://click.bos.sfgov.org/?qs=d13d7f8ce2fd18e97cd4744f64142322fe45f6c1899a5fa296e7ed2458401098a5c53ca5bfc9e220df0a5ce7bb770c0d63f73658fe22c253)!

Supervisor Melgar’s office was contacted by constituents who shared that the sidewalks were badly cracked on a block of Dorantes Avenue in Forest Hill. This made the passage dangerous for folks walking down the street and inaccessible for those using wheelchairs and strollers. Supervisor Melgar’s office immediately reached out to Public Works to repair the sidewalk, which has now been successfully replaced. Thank you to the Public Works crew for your quick work!

**Street Sign Facing Wrong Way Fixed**

Supervisor Melgar’s Office received a request for help fixing a street sign that was facing the wrong way at Ocean Ave and Lagunitas Drive. Supervisor Melgar’s office connected the constituent to the SFMTA and they were able to get the sign fixed the very same day! The office would like to extend a big thank you to the streets division at the SFMTA, especially the workers who replaced the sign, who were very responsive and made sure the sign got fixed.
