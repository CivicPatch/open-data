 Dear District 8 Residents and Friends,

June was a whirlwind month at City Hall. I spent much of the month deep in hearings and negotiations over our city’s two-year budget. It wasn’t an easy process and no one got everything they wanted, but we were able to restore critical services, including protecting funding for legal aid, housing support, and community-based organizations. 

June was also Pride Month, and I was honored to once again march alongside so many of you in San Francisco’s Pride Parade! But this month also brought reminders of the work still ahead. In a deeply disappointing move, the Department of Defense announced it would strip Harvey Milk’s name from the Navy ship that once bore it—a shameful erasure of an American hero. But San Francisco will not let bully’s erase Harvey’s legacy. On the last Friday of Pride Month, I joined the Mayor to announce that the long-awaited renovation of Harvey Milk Plaza in the Castro will begin next year.

On June 26 I held two hearings on San Francisco’s behavioral health crisis at the Public Safety and Neighborhood Services Committee. The first focused on San Francisco's implementation of Senate Bill 43 (2019), which expanded the eligibility criteria for conservatorship to include individuals with severe substance use disorder. The second was on the Residential Care and Treatment Workgroup's findings and recommendations on San Francisco’s treatment bed inventory. I had asked Mayor Breed to convene the Workgroup following the passage of Prop 1 in March 2024, and I co-chaired the group. I will continue pressing our departments to turn promises into real, on-the-ground help for people struggling with mental illness and substance use. As always, thank you for your support, your partnership, and your commitment to a more compassionate, livable San Francisco.  
 

Best,

Rafael

## FACES IN THE CROWD: BOB SIEGEL

Welcome to *Faces in the Crowd*, written by Marshall Kilduff, accomplished journalist and long time volunteer with our District 8 Office. Marshall tells the stories of District 8 community members who are going above and beyond to contribute to San Francisco!  
 

![](https://image.bos.sfgov.org/lib/fe3715707564077d701378/m/1/691d7383-ed02-46a0-ba99-459c5022d88a.jpg)

The city needs more dirt than asphalt. It can also use a more knit-together feel missing in its hilly, divided terrain. Bob Siegel is on a mission to solve these issues. He’s the determined force behind the 17-mile Crosstown Trail.

It runs from Candlestick Point, in the city’s southeast, to the water’s edge, above the Cliff House.  Determined hikers can travel the distance in a day while more casual strollers can drop in for a partial stretch. It’s mapped out on crosstowntrail.org, a site created by Siegel and his helpers. And just last month, on the fifth anniversary of the trail, a second pathway was added, running from Fort Funston, near the zoo, to North Beach. Grab your Hokas, San Francisco!

As a Peace Corps volunteer who backpacked through Africa, Siegel spotted an opportunity when he moved here. The trim, 80-something, outdoor enthusiast worked on the still-emerging Bay Ridge Trail and decided the city could fashion its own link. Building on city support, he went to work, walking sidewalks, parks and preserves. He found something stunning: everywhere he went there was support. Laguna Honda welcomed a stretch behind its midtown hospital. The well-off Forest Hill neighborhood didn’t object to newcomers wandering through. A string of city, state, and federal agencies agreed with his idea and skipped the red tape.  

The result is a city on full display. Hawks in the sky and wildflowers on hillsides. When the trail hits the streets there are coffee spots and bookstores. Stairways and hilltop vistas are slipped in. The trail hosts birthdays, dates, and youth groups looking for an outdoor adventure. Its popularity also got a boost during the Covid shutdown, when people needed a release from cooped up living quarters.

In a city where bureaucracy can rule, Siegel was surprised. “There was no pushback. It was wonderful how people supported the idea.” The project proves another lesson for would-be activists. “It pays to be a self starter, something I learned in the Peace Corps.” Though the city had plans for a public trail, the idea languished until Siegel and friends ran with it. “It never would have happened otherwise,” he said.

For now the trail barely touches District 8, but the new second trail will shoot down from Twin Peaks and run through Buena Vista Park, Adah’s Stairway, and Duboce Park, on its way to Civic Center.

Siegel’s homegrown idea has taken root elsewhere, making him a celebrity on the wool sock circuit. He’s now in touch with Boston, which is planning a 27 mile walkway, and Seattle, which wants a 31 mile path. Crowded, busy cities are finding a way to relax and enjoy themselves. 

## **GET INVOLVED IN YOUR CITY!**

**Attend the Treatment on Demand Hearing**  
 

On July 24th at 10am, I will hold a hearing to understand the shortcomings of the Treatment on Demand policy and what needs to be done to improve its utilization. San Francisco's Treatment on Demand Act (Proposition T), passed in 2008, mandates that the city provide sufficient free and low-cost substance use disorder treatment services to meet public demand. The goal of this legislation was to ensure the City had recovery resources available the second someone needed them, but the implementation has been spotty. 

Want to tune in? Head to [sfgovtv.org](https://click.bos.sfgov.org/?qs=eb9b03fc4ea91136691933ecea8976e905f0c65e30820e07fc01ac02b01e2ca62d1481b79b736ed5b7c17a47f7e6ad32dea557773d7b266c) on July 24th at 10am.

**Take a Tour of the Southeast Wastewater Treatment Plant**

Have you ever wondered what happens to the dirty water from your shower, laundry, and toilet after it goes down the drain? What about water that flows into storm drains from rain, watering lawns, and washing cars? Find out by taking a free tour of the Southeast Wastewater Treatment Plant. You'll go behind the scenes to see (and smell!) how this vital infrastructure works. 

Sign up at [sfpuc.gov/wastewater-plant-tour](https://click.bos.sfgov.org/?qs=eb9b03fc4ea91136601f7e823145ae67be2085e740eacf9809465b43835d85dc43d714d46e2d341b4a20b6b187a14227ff28e103db81ff82).

**Learn About the Commission Streamlining Task Force!**  
 

Last November, San Francisco voters approved Proposition E, creating the Commission Streamlining Task Force. The Task Force is charged with reviewing the City’s many appointive boards and commissions and making recommendations to the Mayor and Board of Supervisors on how to modify, eliminate, or consolidate them for more effective, efficient, and economical governance.

The Task Force meets every first and third Wednesday at 1 PM in City Hall room 408 to discuss potential improvements to the structure of City government.  
Learn more about the Commission Streamlining Task Force today on its [website](https://click.bos.sfgov.org/?qs=eb9b03fc4ea911362c45630e652f87c22fc9bdb1a11affbc0e96451d2638950b192f6374802c985d5700c133f65306c1886e211cd8de7c4e).

Interested members of the public can join the Task Force mailing list or share feedback by emailing [commissionstreamlining@sfgov.org](mailto:commissionstreamlining@sfgov.org). 

**Join a Commission!**  
 

San Francisco has 100+ committees and commissions that advise City Departments on how to administer the City’s services and revenues. From advising on how the City distributes its Sugary Drink Tax revenue to ensuring the success of San Francisco’s City College, these commissions are a great way to use your background and expertise in service to the City of San Francisco.

## IN THE NEWS

**SFPD issuing more traffic tickets, new data reveals**

[NBC Bay Area](https://click.bos.sfgov.org/?qs=eb9b03fc4ea911364d4eb7155f9fe0d979bac34bacf02f1d8109a65c4c3dd64e2c41a46be2a190e191f4ee21292871538da0e2e5f8e1af35) - June 2nd

Mandelman, bicycle and pedestrian safety advocates said that they are happy that San Francisco police are increasing their traffic enforcement efforts. But they added very quickly, it's not enough." "We are still significantly below 2020 levels. And 2020 levels were way below 2014 levels,” Mandelman said.

**What's new - and what's very familiar - in Lurie's budget proposal**

[SF Examiner](https://click.bos.sfgov.org/?qs=eb9b03fc4ea91136f1fcce51491cab53dc5fb1d8b8a388e1a6796952214a44c691fc2ae2ef8158b1baf164e0478a6078e6285636bcfc9e86) - June 3

Board of Supervisors President Rafael Mandelman said he’s still digesting the budget, but he said “I think it represents a real effort to bring our expenditures more in line with our revenues. We’re going to find that cuts are painful,” Mandelman said. “They're real. They're impacting real organizations doing important work for various communities.”

**Mandelman becomes powerbroker in high-stakes police commission fight** 

[The Bay Area Reporter](https://click.bos.sfgov.org/?qs=eb9b03fc4ea911363dc3135719db9d73725743675d1d52da16f5f0034de3c75ec7bc8e9664d435c27beee8fd946ab106e081e04560e86554), June 16

Mandelman extended support for Pratibha Tekkey for a seat on San Francisco’s Police Commission at a Board of Supervisors Panel. 

Mandelman spoke to Tekkey’s work day-to-day in the Tenderloin, and said this seat had traditionally been set aside for community voices, particularly surrounding the Mission district and the Latino community, but that “if you think of a neighborhood that needs representation in the conversation about safety in San Francisco and whose serious concerns must be addressed … it’s the Tenderloin.”

**SF Civil Grand Jury finds part of 'Vision Zero' failure due to lack of police traffic enforcement**

In March 2024, San Francisco Supervisor Rafael Mandelman warned us.

"If there's no enforcement, you can change all the rules you want to and no one will take them seriously," he said.

**SF Supervisors Preserve Millions for Homeless Prevention, Housing in Budget**

"After more than 14 hours of tense closed-door negotiations, the city’s Budget and Appropriations Committee at 2 a.m. Thursday voted to move the amended $16 billion budget proposal forward to the full Board of Supervisors."

**'Profoundly disappointing' modest gains in S.F.'s effort to force mentally ill people into treatment**

“It’s profoundly disappointing that we are where we are,” Mandelman said during a Thursday hearing, which he had called for, of the Public Safety and Neighborhood Services Committee. Centered on behavioral health issues since he was first elected in 2018, Mandelman has sponsored several actions in support of expanding conservatorship programs. Now, he’s turned critical of the little progress that’s been made.

**Loosened rules not leading to SF conservatorship rush, data show**

“I think we’ve all gotten something wrong in the way that we are thinking about what it takes to solve the problem of severe mental illness, indigent folks who may not know what they need,” Supervisor Rafael Mandelman said during Thursday’s meeting.

**More incentives planned for SF commercial-to-housing conversions, but there are still challenges** 

[ABC 7](https://click.bos.sfgov.org/?qs=eb9b03fc4ea91136326175ed7966abaca9629f524041306235da9c3712a4b98a2029182dcba7b54fc6af9bbe842711e770ed8999892bf62b) - June 28

"Where are we going? Are we headed into a recovery or are we headed into recession, that will make a difference. What happens with interest rates? What happens with tariffs?" asked Mandelman.
