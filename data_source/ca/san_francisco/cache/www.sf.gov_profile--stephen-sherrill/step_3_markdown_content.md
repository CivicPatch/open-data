# District 2

Stephen Sherrill

District 2

**Supervisor Stephen Sherrill**

Supervisor Stephen Sherrill represents District 2, which includes the Marina, Pacific Heights, Cow Hollow, and Presidio Heights.

A proud father raising two young children, Stephen is deeply committed to making San Francisco a place where families, businesses, and communities can thrive. He brings a wealth of experience in public service to the Board of Supervisors, with a career spanning federal and local government.

Stephen served as the Director of the Mayor’s Office of Innovation under Mayor London Breed, where he led efforts to address San Francisco’s homelessness crisis. His work focused on data-driven solutions and coordinated service delivery, including the creation of ASTRID, an innovative system that integrates housing, health, and emergency response data to provide comprehensive support to unhoused residents. His commitment to accountability and transparency has helped direct resources to those who need them most. 

Prior to living in San Francisco, Stephen served as a senior policy advisor under New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. In this role, he worked on clean streets initiatives, disaster response efforts, and sustainability programs, including the expansion of composting and recycling. He also contributed to the city’s emergency response during Hurricane Sandy. 

Stephen’s priorities as Supervisor reflect his deep connection to District 2 and demonstrate his belief in San Francisco’s bright future. He is committed to enhancing public safety, ensuring clean and safe neighborhoods, improving our commercial corridors, and making it more feasible and joyful to raise a family in the city. A passionate advocate for small businesses, he champions initiatives like “First Year Free,” which removes barriers for new entrepreneurs and supports vibrant commercial corridors.

As a proud resident of District 2, Stephen is dedicated to being accessible and responsive to the needs of his constituents. You can often find him walking through the Marina Green with his family, grabbing a coffee in Cow Hollow, or meeting with local small business owners to hear their concerns and ideas.

Stephen looks forward to building on the strong foundation of those who came before him and working with his colleagues on the Board to ensure San Francisco’s best days lie ahead.
