Daniel Lurie was born and raised in San Francisco. From his leadership at Tipping Point Community to the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee, Daniel has a proven track record of public service and a longstanding commitment to improving the lives of San Franciscans.

In 2005, Daniel founded Tipping Point Community – a pioneer in anti-poverty initiatives across the Bay Area. Under his direction, Tipping Point raised over $500 million to house, employ, educate, and support hundreds of thousands of Bay Area families. In his role as CEO, Daniel steered $100 million to the chronic homelessness initiative, the largest private investment to date in housing access in San Francisco. Among the program’s successes was a new financing model to construct permanent supportive housing 50% faster and more affordably than the City had ever done before. 

Former Mayor Ed Lee selected Daniel in 2013 to lead the San Francisco Bay Area Super Bowl 50 Host Committee, an effort that brought over $240 million in economic impact to the region. Over a quarter of the funds from the event were then reinvested in programs serving Bay Area youth. Following the devastating fires in the North Bay in 2017, Daniel and Tipping Point partnered with 90 Bay Area business and community leaders to organize Band Together – a benefit concert that raised $17 million for those hardest hit by the deadly fires. In total, Tipping Point’s Emergency Fire Relief Fund raised over $34 million.

Daniel is a graduate of Duke University and obtained his Master’s in Public Policy at UC Berkeley. He lives in the City with his wife, Becca, and two school-aged children.
