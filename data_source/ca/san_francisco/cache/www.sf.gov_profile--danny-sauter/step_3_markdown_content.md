# District 3

Danny Sauter

District 3

 

**Supervisor Danny Sauter**

Supervisor Danny Sauter represents District 3, which comprises San Francisco’s incredible northeastern neighborhoods including the Barbary Coast &amp; Northern Waterfront, Chinatown, Lower Nob Hill, Financial District, Fisherman’s Wharf, Jackson Square, Nob Hill, North Beach, Polk Gulch, Russian Hill, Telegraph Hill, and Union Square. 

Danny has a deep background in District 3’s neighborhoods, including serving on the board of his neighborhood association, North Beach Neighbors, for more than 8 years. During this time, he started and ran the North Beach Farmers Market, coordinated a free delivery service to support restaurants during the pandemic, and organized neighborhood cleanups. He served as the first Housing Chair of the San Francisco Sierra Club and as the District 3 Director of the Eastern Neighborhoods Democratic Club. 

Prior to being elected to office, Danny was the Executive Director of San Francisco Neighborhood Centers Together, a citywide coalition of community centers serving youth and older adults. Through this work, he strengthened community centers, including Cameron House in Chinatown and TEL HI Neighborhood Center in North Beach. Danny also was the co-founder of Bamboo, a marketing agency which he founded in District 3 and grew from 2 to 50 employees.

Danny grew up in the Midwest with dreams of moving to San Francisco for its opportunities and dynamic culture. Danny’s passion for community service started at a young age. His father was a labor lawyer working with unions while his mother taught at his high school and directed the community service program for students. 

Danny studied at Miami University and graduated with a major in Marketing and dual-minors in Entrepreneurship and Chinese. He studied abroad in China during college and learned Mandarin. He has since taken Cantonese classes and been active in the Save Cantonese movement at City College. 

Danny and his wife have lived in North Beach for more than a decade. When he’s not working on community issues, Danny enjoys exploring San Francisco’s bookstores and coffee shops, traversing the city by Muni, and cheering on the Giants.
