## Second District

### Cindy Allen

Councilmember Allen was elected in 2020 to represent Long Beach's Second Council District. Councilmember Allen serves as Chair of the Economic Development and Opportunity Committee, as Vice Chair of the Intergovernmental Affairs Committee, and on the Arts, Culture, and Tourism Committee. Councilmember Allen also represents the City of Long Beach as a Board Member of the National League of Cities and at the Southern California Association of Governments as a Regional Council Member where she also serves on the Energy and Environment Committee, the Resilience and Conservation Subcommittee,  the Legislative/Communications and Memberships Committee, and as an alternate on the Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee.

Councilmember Allen has been a Long Beach resident most of her life, grew up on the west side of Long Beach with a single mother who struggled with addiction in their early years, and attended Stephens Middle School and Long Beach Poly High School, where she served as student body president. Councilmember Allen attended Long Beach City College while working as a waitress, maid, and flower shop attendant, and put herself through school, eventually earning a Bachelor's degree in Business Management and a Master’s degree from Long Beach State in Public Administration.   

Growing up in an underserved and marginalized neighborhood made Councilmember Allen wants to serve her community, so in 1988 she became a Long Beach Police Officer during a time when very few women were doing that job. During her 10 years at the LBPD, she was awarded more than 20 commendations for bravery and exceptional service to Long Beach.

Councilmember Allen learned a lot about courage working as a Police Officer, so when she left the department after a serious back injury that occurred on the job, she decided to become an entrepreneur. Councilmember Allen started and operated several small businesses in downtown Long Beach. She remains proud of the opportunities that Long Beach has given her, and tells young entrepreneurs that she could not have built these companies in any other city.

Councilmember Allen is also a double mastectomy breast cancer survivor, has been married to her husband for 25 years, and has two adult children. Councilmember Allen and her husband Randy are proud parents of a lesbian daughter, and both work diligently with the LBGTQ+ community to ensure that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people can live openly without discrimination.
