## Sixth District

### Councilwoman Dr. Suely Saro

Dr. Suely Saro has been the City Councilwoman for Long Beach's Sixth District since December 2020. She understands the immigrant experience first-hand, which drives her dedication to fighting for equity. She was born in a refugee camp to parents who survived the Cambodian Genocide. Focused on a future of organizing, civic engagement, and advocacy, Dr. Saro pushed against the odds to earn three degrees: a Bachelor’s degree in Molecular Cellular Developmental Biology from the University of California, Santa Cruz, a Master’s degree in Public Administration from California State University, Long Beach and a Doctorate in Education (Ed.D) and Organizational Leadership from the University of La Verne.

Dr. Saro began her career as a labor organizer, working alongside janitors and healthcare workers in their fight for fair wages and better working conditions. Then, she became the first Cambodian American Executive Director of Khmer Girls in Action, helping develop youth leadership skills to improve their schools and community. Dr. Saro then joined the Health Access Project at Asian Americans Advancing Justice Los Angeles to provide education, build coalitions, and advocate for the Affordable Care Act. She went on to work for the California State Legislature and was an Adjunct Professor at Cal State LA. Dr. Saro then served as a Conservancy Project Development Specialist with the San Gabriel and Lower Los Angeles Rivers and Mountains Conservancy (RMC). Currently, she is the Manager of Stakeholder Relations at AES Clean Energy. Dr. Saro and her husband proudly raise their two young children in Central Long Beach.

Meanwhile, she is dedicated to alleviating poverty and empowering women with disabilities in Cambodia, where she co-founded and was the Board Chair of the Women for Women Foundation (WfWF) based in Cambodia. Since 2005, WfWF has helped over 700 women with disabilities and their families increase their economic security by working in a social enterprise program. WfWF is a member of the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO), allowing its fashionable accessories and products to be sold worldwide.  

Dr. Saro serves in the following City Council committees and special committees:

- Economic Development and Opportunity Committee  – Chair
- Arts, Culture, and Tourism Committee – Vice Chair
- Mobility, Ports, and Infrastructure Committee – Member
- Southern California Association of Governments - Region Council District 29
- Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority – Chair
- Los Angeles County Sanitation Board – Representative
- Spring Street Joint Powers Authority – 6th District Member
- Educational Partnerships Committee  – 6th District Member
