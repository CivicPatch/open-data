## Fourth District

### Councilman Daryl Supernaw

Councilman Daryl Supernaw was born and raised in Long Beach and is a lifelong resident of the 4th council district. He is a graduate of Buffum Elementary, Stanford Junior High and Wilson High. He also earned both his B.A. and M.A. from CSULB. He has been married to his wife, Cheryl, for 45 years. They have son, a daughter and two granddaughters. Having worked as a business and marketing consultant for thirty years, Supernaw has an extensive business background in industries ranging from port-related logistics to hospitality. Prior to being elected to city council, he was an active community advocate and applied his private sector skills in working with virtually every department at City Hall. He was elected to city council in 2015 and is completing his third term. Councilman Supernaw has a hands-on leadership style in resolving constituent concerns on a daily basis. These include quality of life issues surrounding homelessness, road/curb/sidewalk repair and public safety. Major accomplishments have been the restoration of Fire Engine 17, an ordinance addressing Street Racing Takeovers and the “retail renaissance” surrounding the traffic circle. He continually promotes a positive sense of community that is exemplified by the 4th council district motto, Go Fourth!
