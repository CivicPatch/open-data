##### Biography

Mary Zendejas’s life is a testament to the power of determination, resilience, and the pursuit of a better life. Born to immigrant parents in Mexico, Mary faced adversity from an early age when at just eight months old she was diagnosed with polio. Leaving behind four of her siblings, Mary’s parents embarked on the courageous journey that would ultimately pave the way for her to have a brighter future. After three years and a new baby born into the family, they became legal residents through amnesty. Mary’s parents instilled in her the values of hard work, perseverance, and the importance of higher education.
