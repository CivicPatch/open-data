## Eighth District

### Councilmember Tunua Thrash-Ntuk

Councilwoman Tunua Thrash-Ntuk was sworn into office on December 17, 2024, to represent the diverse neighborhoods and communities of the 8th Council District in Long Beach. With three decades of experience in the non-profit and private sectors, she is a seasoned community and economic development practitioner. As a Councilwoman, her priorities include revitalizing neighborhoods by championing small business growth through grant programs, enhancing public safety through community policing initiatives, preventing homelessness by expanding access to affordable housing resources, and addressing long-overdue repairs to local streets, sidewalks, and parks.

The Councilwoman is the President and CEO of The Center by Lendistry, where she works with small businesses from underserved communities to access funding, education, and business services. Before this role, she was the Executive Director of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation in Los Angeles (LISC LA), leading regional efforts to build more affordable housing, expand access to health services, and bridge the racial wealth gap. In 2023, the Councilwoman served as Long Beach Mayor Rex Richardson's 100-Day Plan Transition Team Co-Chair, where she brought together local experts to set the best policies to tackle the most significant challenges facing Long Beach. In 2018, she also Co-Chaired the City of Long Beach’s “Everyone In” Economic Inclusion Policy Taskforce. The initiative was designed to build economic inclusion recommendations, which are outlined in the City's Blueprint for Economic Development, to create a local economy that includes and benefits every Long Beach resident.

Councilwoman Thrash-Ntuk has a long track record of service as a board member or advisory board member for many entities, including Federal Home Loan Bank San Francisco’s Affordable Housing Council, Housing California, City of LA Measure HHH Citizens Oversight Commission, Southern California Edison’s Consumer Advisory Panel, Union Bank’s Community Advisory Board, Long Beach Transit Authority Board of Directors, and the Los Angeles Development Fund, which is the City of Los Angeles’ New Market Tax Credit implementation group. Additionally, she has served as her daughter's Girls Scout Troop Leader, volunteers at the Alpert Jewish Community Center, President of Jack and Jill of America, Long Beach Chapter, a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. Long Beach Chapter, and was crowned Mrs. Long Beach in 2019.

The Councilwoman was the first in her family to attend college, earning her Master’s in City Planning from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and her undergraduate degree from the University of California, Berkeley.

She and her husband are raising their children in North Long Beach.
