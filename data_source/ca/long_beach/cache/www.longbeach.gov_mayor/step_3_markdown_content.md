He has also held the position of Western District Cities Representative on the South Coast Air Quality Management District Governing Board.

Mayor Rex Richardson is the leader of the 44th most populous city in America, home to the nation’s second largest port and Space Beach, which is amongst the fastest-growing aerospace clusters in the country.

Since taking office, Mayor Richardson has been at the forefront of addressing the most pressing challenges facing Long Beach through his “Opportunity Beach” Agenda, which focused on key priorities such as homelessness, economic recovery, public safety, youth development, and environmental sustainability.

Mayor Richardson and his wife, Dr. Nina Richardson, are proudly raising their two young daughters, Alina and Mila, in the North Long Beach community. He understands the work and determination it takes for families and communities to climb into the middle class. He believes that everyone, no matter their circumstance, deserves the opportunity to thrive.
