# Board of Selectmen

The Board of Selectmen consists of five elected members who serve for a three-year term as the governing body of the town. They oversee the general operations of the Town as approved by Town Meeting.

The annual budget is prepared by the Selectmen and presented to town citizens in a Deliberative Session before a final ballot vote at the polls the second week in March. The Selectmen also act as the Board of Assessors, granting or denying abatements, and as the Board of Health, approving or denying health regulations.

The Selectmen meet Monday evenings, and citizens are welcome to attend these public meetings. Meeting times vary, so please check each upcoming agenda for the exact time.

Video of past Selectmen meetings are available on-line via video streaming, and you can also download the published minutes of past Selectmen meetings.
