Confidence is high but not perfect due to the '3/25' format requiring interpretation to YYYY-MM, but it's a common abbreviation for month/year end dates in this context. Today's date is 2025-07-02, so the term has expired, but the instruction is to extract the end date if found, not to filter based on current date for end_date itself, only for active roles. The role of 'Councilor' is listed with this term end date, but the 'Assistant Mayor' role is listed as '2025 - Present', indicating it is current. Therefore, the person is still active in at least one role, and the end date for the councilor term is relevant to that specific role's duration. The prompt states 'Include only active roles (today is 2025-07-02)', and Devin R. Wilkie is listed as 'Assistant Mayor: 2025 - Present', making them an active office holder. The 'Term expires 3/25' refers to the Councilor role, which is a past term, but the Assistant Mayor role is current. The instruction is to exclude if the person has resigned or vacated, which is not the case here. The instruction also says 'If such dates clearly indicate the role was held only in the past and is not the person's current role, DO NOT extract that specific role title.' The 'Councilor' role is listed with a past term end date, but the 'Assistant Mayor' role is current. I will extract the current role and the end date associated with the past role if it's explicitly stated for that person, as the person is still active in another role. However, the schema only allows one end_date per person, not per role. Given the 'Assistant Mayor' role is '2025 - Present', a single end_date for the person would be null. I will set end_date to null as the person is currently serving as Assistant Mayor with no explicit end date for that role, and the 'Term expires 3/25' applies to the Councilor role which is now past. The prompt states 'If such dates clearly indicate the role was held only in the past and is not the person's current role, DO NOT extract that specific role title.' The 'Councilor' role is past. The 'Assistant Mayor' role is current and has no end date. Therefore, the end_date for the person should be null.",

The guideline states 'YYYY-MM' or 'YYYY-MM-DD' are allowed, and 'Term expires 3/26' is a clear indication of March 2026.
