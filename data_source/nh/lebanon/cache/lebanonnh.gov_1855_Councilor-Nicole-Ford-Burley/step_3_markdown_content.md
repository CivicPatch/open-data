### What motivated you to serve on the City Council?

Like many communities, Lebanon is facing some tough challenges. I want to be part of the solution to help Lebanon navigate these challenges, and I think City Council is where I can do the most good.

### What are your focus areas or priorities while serving on City Council?

My top priorities are:

1. Maintaining a reasonable budget without sacrificing vital services;
2. Ensuring responsible and equitable growth;
3. Caring for our community and protecting its members.

### What do you enjoy most about being part of the Lebanon community?

My favorite thing about Lebanon is that you never really know everything that's happening in the city. Every time that I think I know all of the arts organizations, or the kid's sports, or the service groups, I hear about a new one or discover a new group doing important work. Lebanon's a really vibrant and exciting place to live.
