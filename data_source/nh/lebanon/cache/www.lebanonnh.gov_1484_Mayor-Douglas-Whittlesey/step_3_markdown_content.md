### What motivated you to serve on the City Council?

With the retirement of one of our long-serving Ward 1 Councilors, I thought joining the Council would be a great opportunity to serve my community. I felt that I could leverage my experience in finance and accounting to contribute to the growth and vibrance of our City.

### What are your focus areas or priorities while serving on City Council?

I continue to focus on the financial sustainability of the City while ensuring we continue to meet our infrastructure and service needs. This cuts across all areas of the City, but with a primary focus on housing, annual budgets, and tax appropriations.

### What do you enjoy most about being part of the Lebanon community?

Lebanon, to me, is the quintessential New England city with a vibrant, thriving community. The City has a wonderful close-knit feel as well as an excellent school system.
