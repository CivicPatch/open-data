###  What motivated you to serve on the City Council? 

I have grown up in the Upper Valley but made the intentional decision to live in Lebanon. The City provides exceptional resources that attract and retain a diverse yet distinctive community. I want to support that community, protecting what makes it an appealing home to so many of us while ensuring voices are heard that otherwise may not have that opportunity. When I was invited to run for City Council, that seemed like an ideal opportunity to serve my community. 

###  What are your focus areas or priorities while serving on City Council? 

I want to ensure Lebanon is responsive to the needs of its community. That includes striving to ensure an economically diverse population can continue to live here while also protecting the resources that make that population want to live here. As such, I want to actively engage with the community to gather input about their needs and desires in order to make the most effective and inclusive decisions possible. That continues to include support for housing, ecological sustainability, and vibrant community cohesiveness.

### What do you enjoy most about being part of the Lebanon community?

Lebanon, to me, combines a stunning natural environment with some of the best amenities often found in much denser cities. I love the easy access to, and general public appreciation of, both community businesses and outdoor activities.
