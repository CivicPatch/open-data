# Board of Selectmen

The Board of Selectmen are the executive, managerial and administrative body, elected by the Citizens of our community to carry out the policies and laws set forth by the vote enacted at Town Meeting. Despite their responsibility as municipal executives, Selectmen can only exercise those powers set forth by State law.
