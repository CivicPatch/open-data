## About

The mission of the City Council is to provide services that contribute to a sense of community and the overall quality of life. Members of the council are elected by the citizens, and they work together to make general policies, supervise city government, and appropriate funds for various needs. The work of a council is usually supported by a number of specialized commissions that focus on specific issues like police, planning, public works, etc. Council meetings are open to the community and public input is welcomed. [Click here](https://www.rochesternh.net/getinvolved) to learn more about providing input.
