# Board of Selectmen

Hillsborough is governed by a Board of Selectmen comprised of three elected members with each elected for a three-year term. The Board is responsible for handling the “prudential affairs” of the Town. The Selectmen hire the Town Administrator who manages the day-to-day operations on behalf of the Board.

Hillsborough operates under the Town Meeting form of government with a traditional March Town Meeting where all registered voters may attend, share their views, and vote on the Warrant Articles presented.

The Selectmen typically meet on the second and fourth Wednesday evenings each month at 6 p.m. The meetings are open to the public and anyone is welcome to attend.  If you wish to speak to the Board on a particular subject/issue, please feel free to contact the Town Administrator so that you can be placed on the agenda.
