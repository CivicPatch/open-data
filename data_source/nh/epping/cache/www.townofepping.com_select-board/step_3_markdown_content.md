# Select Board

The Select Board is the community's principal elected executive board. It consists of five members who serve in a part-time capacity.

The Select Board has the power to do the following:

**Determine the Town Meeting Warrant** – Calls town elections and meetings and publishes the warrants for them, establishes the dates, time, and place, and in general organizes matters up to the point that the moderator calls the meeting to order.

**Make Appointments to Town Boards and Committees** by soliciting volunteers from the community.

**Sign Warrants for the payment of all town bills** – The Treasurer may not issue a check unless a majority of the Board signs a warrant of authorization.

**Grant Licenses and Permits** – Acts as the local licensing authority with the ability to issue licenses and permits for special events, hawkers and peddlers, junk dealers, etc.

**Employ a Town Administrator** to carry out the policies of the Select Board. Jake Roger is currently the Town Administrator.

The Select Board acts as a **collective decision-making body**. One Selectmen cannot make binding decisions – it requires a majority vote of the Board. An individual member of the board may act independently only if specifically authorized by the Board.

## Meetings

The Select Board meets every other Monday evening starting at 7:00 PM with some exceptions.

Meetings are held at the Town Hall in the Meeting Room on the second floor and are open to the public. Meetings are also broadcast live on Epping Cable Channel 22. For meeting availability, please [Email Joyce Blanchard](mailto:secretary@townofepping.com).
