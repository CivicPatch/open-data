# Board of Selectmen

The Board of Selectmen consists of five elected members who serve for a three-year term as the governing body of the town. They oversee the general operations of the Town as approved by Town Meeting.

The annual budget is prepared by the Selectmen and presented to town citizens in a Deliberative Session before a final ballot vote at the polls the second week in March. The Selectmen also act as the Board of Assessors, granting or denying abatements and as the Board of Health, approving or denying health regulations.

The Selectmen meet on monthly (or as needed) on a Monday evening, and citizens are welcome to attend these public meetings. Please be aware that meeting times and schedules still may vary, so please check each upcoming agenda or community events calendar for the exact dates and times.

To request to be placed on the Board of Selectmen agenda, please contact 603.895.7007 or submit an email to: [executiveadmin@raymondnh.gov](mailto:executiveadmin@raymondnh.gov)
