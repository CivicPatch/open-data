 _Reason for Interest in Running for Elected Office:_ 

I am interested in the Town Councilor position in order to give back to my community.  I moved here in 1975 as an undergraduate at UNH living on Old Landing Rd. and Young Drive. I have lived next to the Durham downtown since 2012.  Durham is a special place and I have always appreciated the natural beauty, fantastic location, and outstanding cultural, educational and recreational opportunities available here. My wife and I met at Breaking New Grounds on Main St.  We have had children in the Durham schools who went to Moharimet, ORMS and graduated from ORHS.  Last Summer my grandchildren swam in the UNH Outdoor Pool.

Having worked in the private business sector for over 40 years I understand what needs to be done to work within a budget.  I am open minded and care deeply about our environment, our economy, our schools and our neighborhoods.  I want to help Durham continue to thrive and will work with the residents, Town officials and departments, businesses, and the University to make Durham an even better place to live, learn, work and play.
