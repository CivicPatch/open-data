The City Council is the governing body of the City of Portsmouth and as such is the policy-making entity of the City, except where otherwise expressed in the City Charter. The City Council consists of nine (9) councilors elected at large for terms of two (2) years.

## City Council Goals

### Enhance the supply of housing choices, especially the supply of below-market rate housing options.

- Leverage the resources available via the City’s successful participation in the InvestNH Housing Navigator program (one of six cities in NH chosen);
- Capitalize on the creation of the Housing Blue Ribbon Committee to establish tangible goals and early wins for affordable and workforce housing; and
- Continue to investigate and implement zoning changes to facilitate the development of housing – particularly below-market housing.

### Integrate sustainability, resilience, and climate change mitigation actions throughout City government and community.

- Encourage, support, and promote completion of Climate Action Plan implementation items. Actions to include both the municipal side and the community at large;
- Identify potential changes to municipal zoning and permitting to support sustainability and resiliency; and
- Train and support community leaders.

### Invite and engage the entire community, especially those traditionally unreached, to increase participation and transparency in government.

- Bring City Hall (Council, City staff) to neighborhoods, including Portsmouth Housing Authority properties and condo/apartment associations;
- Encourage new voices, conduct survey on engagement opportunities, re-envision public dialogue with City Councilors; and
- Meet residents where they are!

### Support the needs of residents, businesses, nonprofits, arts and cultural institutions by leveraging City and local resources.

- Encourage, support, and promote implementation items from the Cultural Plan, Public Art Review Committee and initiatives spearheaded by the Arts &amp; Cultural Commission; and
- Support recommendations from the Economic Development Commission relative to economic resilience and small business development and retention.

### Explore opportunities to support all modes of transportation options.

- Investigate feasibility of a long-discussed downtown loop shuttle, and ways to encourage optimal movement throughout the City to the benefit of all users and neighborhoods;
- Continue collaboration with regional transportation partners;
- Consider metrics of transportation equity; and
- Plan for the future of smart, autonomous, connected vehicles and mobility as a service type, to include potential providers and options.
