  - ## About the Town of Barnstead, NH
    
    The town of Barnstead is situated just south of the lakes region in New Hampshire in [Belknap County](https://www.belknapcounty.org) and is immediately surrounded by the towns of Gilmanton, Alton, Strafford, and Pittsfield with easy access to Laconia, Rochester and Portsmouth. The city of Concord is less than an hour's drive away, as are the recreational areas of the White Mountains, Lake Winnipesauke, the seacoast and Maine's tourist areas. Barnstead's population hovers around 4,000 friendly residents. Many families have called Barnstead home for generations and many families have settled within the town limits because of its peaceful beauty and easy pace of life.
