# Select Board

**Lee is governed by a Select Board comprised of three elected townspeople.**

*MEETINGS ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.*

The Select Board requires anyone interested in having an item added to the agenda to contact the Assistant Town Administrator at 603-659-5414 x301 or [send an email](https://www.leenh.org/user/23/contact). The deadline for submittals is noon on Thursday prior to the Monday night meeting. The agenda is posted Friday.

For a schedule of meetings see the Upcoming Meetings Calendar.

### Mission

The duty of the Select Board, as per RSA 41:8, is to manage the prudential affairs of the town. The Select Board establishes policy, sets long term goals and direction for the provision of municipal services, and reviews and authorizes budgetary expenditures and other appropriations deemed necessary for municipal services.

While the members of the Select Board are generally not in the administrative offices during the day, any inquiries, concerns or issues can be addressed by the Town Administrator and the town staff. In addition, the Select Board members may be reached by mail at Lee Town Offices 249 Calef Highway, Lee, NH 03861.
