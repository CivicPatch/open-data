### Membership Details

While the members of the Board of Selectmen are not generally available in the Administrative offices during the course of the business day, any concerns or questions can be addressed by the Administrative staff and/or the Town Administrator. If listed in the local telephone directory, the Selectmen may be reached at their homes.

Members of the Board of Selectmen are elected by the voters. Anyone interested in running is encouraged toEmail the Town Clerkfor more information about the candidacy filing period, which takes place in January, and is subject to a deadline.

## History of Governance

Since its incorporation, the Town of Windham and its residents have been served by dedicated members of the community, giving generously of their time and expertise to the betterment of the town. With the exception of the first three years after the granting of our charter, the Windham Board of Selectmen always consisted of 3 elected members. It was not until over 240 years later, in 1987, that the growth in town prompted the Annual Town Meeting to increase the Board’s membership to five.

## Responsibilities

Although the configuration of the Board has undergone changes, the duties and responsibilities it is charged with have varied very little through the years. The addition to the staff of our Town Administrator in 1988 has lessened the burden on the Board in - among other things - managing the day to day operations of the Town, as well as preparation of budgetary matters and oversight of personnel issues, however it has not removed these responsibilities entirely. Working in cooperation with the Town Administrator, Department Heads, employees, residents, and a host of others, the primary objective of the Board remains the oversight and management of the Town’s financial, departmental, and community affairs

As established, this Forest encompasses the following 6 parcels of Town Conservation Land located in the area of Bayberry Road: 25-R-7010, 25-R-8000, 25-R-7025, 25-R-103, 25-R-6500, and 25-R-6000A.

Establishment

The Windham Forestry Committee was established in 2014 by the Board of Selectmen following an affirmative Town Meeting vote to create a Town Forest comprised of various town-owned parcels as authorized under RSA 31:110. As established, this Forest encompasses the following 6 parcels of Town Conservation Land located in the area of Bayberry Road: 25-R-7010, 25-R-8000, 25-R-7025, 25-R-103, 25-R-6500, and 25-R-6000A. Collectively, these parcels comprise approximately 201.4 acres.

You may view a map of the area, the  [Map Street Outline (PDF)](https://nh-windham.civicplus.com/DocumentCenter/View/523). At the March 2017 Town Meeting, by-laws were adopted for the management of the Forest, you may view the  [Management of the Forest By-Laws (PDF)](https://nh-windham.civicplus.com/DocumentCenter/View/522).

## Responsibilities

The Forestry Committee is responsible for the management of the Town Forest and, as required in NH RSA 31:111, performs the following functions:

 * Develops a Forestry Management Plan.
 * Encourages the proper management of the timber, firewood, and other natural resources associated with the Forest through plantings, timber stand improvements, thinning, harvesting, reforestation, and other multiple use programs consistent with an approved Forest Management Plan.
 * Identifies and pursues Federal, State, and other grants and funding for the purposes of managing and maintaining the Town Forest.

## Town Forest Stewardship Plan

The town is interested in a multiple use concept for its forested properties. This concept includes recreation, wildlife habitat, soil and water conservation and sound long term sustainable timber management. One of the many benefits that can be derived from long-term sustained yield forestry is the generation of periodic revenue from timber harvests.

Far more important is that responsible timber harvesting also encourages the growth of quality trees that remain after the harvest as well as the establishment and or release of tree regeneration, in order to grow tomorrow’s forest beneath the forest of today. Forest management can also be beneficial to wildlife in that harvesting has the potential to create browse from sprouting cut trees as well as provide cover for wildlife as the seedling trees develop into saplings.
