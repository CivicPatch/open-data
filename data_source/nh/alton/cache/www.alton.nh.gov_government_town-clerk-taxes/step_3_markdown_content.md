The Tax Collector is responsible for the collection of taxes, including property, current use, timber and excavation taxes. The tax year runs from April 1 to March 31. Property owners are billed on a semi-annual basis. The first bill is mailed the end of May and is due approximately the first week of July. The amount of the first bill is 1/2 of the previous years tax. The second bill is based on the property assessment as of April 1 of the current year, multiplied by the tax rate, which is set by the state of New Hampshire Department of Revenue Administration in the fall of each year. Depending on when the tax rate is set, the due date of the second bill will vary. The second bill is due 30 days from the date the last bill is mailed.

According to state law, bills are sent to the address of the last known owner. The tax assessor's office updates its records according to transfers received from the Belknap County Registry of Deeds on a monthly basis. If you recently purchased property your attorney or closing company should have checked the status of taxes due. However, it is your responsibility as the owner to make sure they are paid and to advise us of your mailing address in writing.

Tax bills may be paid at the town hall by check, cash or credit card during the Tax Collector's regularly scheduled hours. You may also pay or find tax information by using our on-line service. Just go to the top of the page and click on the purple “Property Taxes” box and follow the prompts. If you mail your payment and want a receipt, you must include the entire bill and a self-addressed stamped envelope with your payment and your receipt will be mailed to you.

Any information or questions regarding tax billing, liens and deeding, please call the office. We'd be happy to answer any concerns you may have.

Please note: There are additional fees to cover the cost of the credit/debit card fees – 2.99% with a $2.50 minimum. These fees go directly to our third-party processor and are not retained by the Town of Alton.
