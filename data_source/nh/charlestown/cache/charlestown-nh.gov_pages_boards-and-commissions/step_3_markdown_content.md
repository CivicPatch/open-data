## **Selectboard**

### Duties &amp; Responsibilities

The selectmen serve as a town’s chief executive body. They have overall responsibility for the general operations of town government. They are authorized to enter into contracts on behalf of the municipality.

While most other town boards and offices serve a particular function (e.g., assessors, finance, school, health), the selectmen’s responsibilities are much broader. Their job is often one of sorting out the various positions of different departments and boards to determine the best overall course of action for the town. Selectmen play an active and strong role in the financial management of the town.

### Membership

- The Charlestown Selectboard is a five member board. Each member is voted in at the Town’s annual vote.
