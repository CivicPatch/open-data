  Northwood, a bucolic town in southeastern New Hampshire, was founded in 1773 when its first settlers successfully petitioned the Governor's Council requesting separation from Nottingham. Since this section of Nottingham had been known as the great north woods, the newly formed town was called Northwood.
  
  Northwood Town Offices are open from 9:00am to 4:00pm Monday thru Thursday.  
  See Town Clerk/Tax Collector page for hours.
