  Northwood, a bucolic town in southeastern New Hampshire, was founded in 1773 when its first settlers successfully petitioned the Governor's Council requesting separation from Nottingham. Since this section of Nottingham had been known as the great north woods, the newly formed town was called Northwood.
  
  Northwood Town Offices are open from 9:00am to 4:00pm Monday thru Thursday.  
  See Town Clerk/Tax Collector page for hours.

##### About

*"Every town, at the annual meeting, shall choose, by ballot, one selectman to hold office for 3 years. The selectmen shall manage the prudential affairs of the town and perform the duties by law prescribed."* - **New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated Chapter 41 Section 8.**

The Board of Selectmen acts as the executive branch of the Town Government carrying out the policies and laws set forth by the vote of the Citizens at Town Meeting. Despite their responsibility as municipal executives, Selectmen can only exercise those powers set forth by State law.

In Northwood, the Board of Selectmen is made up of Five members, each elected to a three year term. After Town Meeting, the Board selects a presiding officer from their ranks who shall be the Chair. Traditionally, the Chair has been the individual in the last year of their term.
