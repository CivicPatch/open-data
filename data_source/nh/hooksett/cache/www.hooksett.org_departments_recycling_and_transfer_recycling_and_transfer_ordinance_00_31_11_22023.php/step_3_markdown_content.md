SECTION II  
CURBSIDE AUTOMATED COLLECTION  
Currently any recyclable materials (see current list at hooksett.org) that can be removed from  
the waste stream at the curb and recycled at the CENTER, will help in waste and cost  
avoidance. The reason for separation is to help control the costs associated with the disposal  
85  
and management of solid waste by diverting as many recyclables from the solid waste stream  
as possible. The listing of acceptable materials will be available at the Recycling and Transfer  
Center, or online at www.hooksett.org under the Recycling and Transfer Department. (The  
Town has suspended automated curbside recycle collection as of October 2019. Both barrels  
are being treated as solid waste)  
1\. The purpose of this section is to establish minimum standards for the storage,  
collection, transportation and disposal of solid waste and recycling, utilizing an  
automated collection program to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the Town's  
residents, employees, and environment, and to minimize the amount of trash generated  
in the Town.  
2\. The Crew Chief shall have the direct responsibility for the administration of this section  
subject to the direction and control of the Director of Public Works, Town Administrator,  
and the Town Council.  
3\. The Town will provide curbside collection of residential solid waste from municipal  
buildings, single family dwellings, detached dwellings, multi-family dwellings (3 units or  
less) situated on separate lots per the policy adopted by September 10, 2003 Town  
Council.  
4\. Two automated collection carts, one for trash, one for recycling, and instructions for use  
will be distributed for residents who receive collection services from the Town. Currently  
the town does not do curbside recycling, the recycling cart may be used for normal  
trash until curbside recycling is resumed.  
5\. It will be the resident's responsibility to assure that automated collection carts are  
placed in the appropriate location designated by the Town, by 7:00 am on collection  
day. The Crew Chief or his/her designee shall have the authority to review and approve  
or disapprove placement of the collection carts. Alternative sites may be necessary to  
safeguard public safety and minimize risk of damage to public or private property during  
the collection process.  
6\. It is the resident's responsibility to remove the automated cart from the curb line by the  
end of the collection day.  
7\. It is prohibited to overload automated carts in a manner that is likely to cause damage  
to the collection vehicle, the automated cart or to create a litter condition or to impede  
collection. It shall be an infraction to place or deposit any refuse whatsoever in or  
around an automated cart owned or provided for the use of another customer without  
that customer's approval.  
8\. The Town shall not be responsible for collection if there are any infractions of any  
section of this policy, or if there are any circumstances that are beyond the control of  
the Town. Infractions or circumstances include, but are not limited to, automated cart  
overload, unacceptable materials, improperly loaded automated cart, blocked access,  
automated cart inaccessibility, improper carts or dangerous situations.  
9\. Automated Carts:  
a. All automated carts are the property of the Town of Hooksett and are not to be  
removed from the property even in the event of a change in ownership or  
resident status. All automated carts will be assigned to a street address and have  
an imprinted number for identification purposes. One cart shall be used for trash  
and one cart for mixed recyclables.  
b. Any repairs to the containers will be performed by the Town. The property  
owner/customer shall contact the Recycling and Transfer office to report damage  
and request a repair. Containers damaged beyond repair will be replaced by the  
86  
Town. If the containers are subject to neglect or other preventable damage as  
determined by the Crew Chief, the Crew Chief will require a charge for the  
replacement. The property owners are the ultimate party responsible for all  
damages or removed containers by tenants. The owner shall pay the cost of  
$80.00 for any replacement containers. The owner should work to educate the  
household members on the proper use and maintenance of the containers.  
c. All trash and recyclables shall be placed into the appropriate containers so that  
the lid can be securely shut. No trash placed on the ground or in any unapproved  
containers shall be picked-up by the town. The containers shall not be overfilled  
or arranged in any manner that will prevent the lid from remaining closed at all  
times to prevent water from filling the container, and access by animals. In the  
event of overflow, residents may bring the extra material to the facility or must  
wait till the next scheduled collection day.  
10\. Placement of Carts - It shall be the duty of each customer to place the carts as  
follows:  
a. Within two (2) feet of the curb line not more than 5 feet from traveled portion of  
roadway or where directed by the Town.  
b. At least five (5) feet away from all objects such as fences, mailboxes, and utility  
poles, and clear of overhanging vegetation, utility wires, etc. to allow for the  
unimpeded operation of collection vehicles.  
c. So that the automated cart handle is facing the dwelling unit.  
d. At least two (2) feet from the other cart.  
e. At least ten (10) feet away from parked vehicles.  
11\. Approved Materials for Automated Curbside Collection  
a. All household trash must be bagged before placing into the trash container for  
the automated curbside program.  
b. ONLY household trash will be collected at the curb. All other material for disposal  
must be brought to the Recycling and Transfer Center at 210 West River Rd.  
12\. Enforcement - Collection  
It is the intention of the Department to educate residents as to the value of recycling  
and the appropriate procedures for doing so. If, however, a resident or tenant  
violates any provision of this section (Section 11) it may result in the issuance of  
notices, warnings and possible loss of services.  
First Violation - A white sticker will be placed on the barrel noting the discrepancy.  
If the violation is the disposal of any unacceptable material, the cost of disposal  
(user fee) may be incurred.  
Second Violation - A pink sticker will be placed on the barrel noting the discrepancy  
and if the violation is the disposal of any unacceptable material the cost of the  
disposal (user fee) may be incurred.  
Third Violation - A third violation will result in the loss of collection privileges, for an  
amount of time determined by the Crew Chief, with approval by the Town  
Administrator. The violator shall have the right to appeal to the Town Council.  
87  
SECTION Ill

Condominiums will be required to provide for the collection and disposal of domestic trash within  
their communities. The Town will reimburse tonnage at a maximum of 21 pounds per unit per  
week at the Town budgeted rate (for trash disposal), paid semi-annually, upon submission and  
verification of paid invoices by the condominium association. The Town Council may rescind or  
amend this section at any time, with the advice of the Recycle and Transfer Advisory  
Committee, subject to a Public Hearing.
