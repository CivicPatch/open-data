### The City Council

The Keene City Council consists of 15 members: Two in each of the five wards, plus five at-large members.

The Council appoints certain City officials including: the City Manager, who serves as the chief executive officer of the City; the City Attorney, who provides legal services to the Council and other City boards and departments; and the City Clerk, who works closely with all other City officials to see that the wishes of the Council are carried out.

Would you like to communicate with the Council on an item of concern to you?  [Visit our Council Communications page](https://keenenh.gov/my-city-government/submitting-communication-city-council/).

### Standing Committees

Each City Councilor is assigned to a Council Standing Committee. There are three Standing Committees charged with hearing various issues and providing recommendations back to the full Council for their consideration. The commencement of each municipal year is when the Mayor appoints Councilors to serve on specific Council Standing Committees. All Standing Committees of the Council consist of five (5) members.
