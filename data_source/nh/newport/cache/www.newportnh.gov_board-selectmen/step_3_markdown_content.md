# Board of Selectmen

### About the Board:

Newport is governed by five elected Selectmen and the vote of the Town Meeting.  The daily administration of the town and supervision of town employees is the responsibility of the Town Manager, who is hired by the Board of Selectmen.

The **Selectmen meet at 6:30 pm on the first and third Monday of each month** in the Selectmen’s Meeting Room in the Municipal Office Building, 15 Sunapee Street.  This is a public meeting, and the agenda for each meeting is posted in the lobby of the Town Offices on the preceding Friday and on NCTV Channel 10, Newport’s cable access television channel.
