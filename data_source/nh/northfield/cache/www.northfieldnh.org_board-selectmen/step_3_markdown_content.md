# Board of Selectmen

[**Email the Board of Selectmen**](mailto:selectmen@northfieldnh.gov)

* * *

The Board of Selectmen is the executive body charged with doing what is necessary to carry out the vote of the people at town meeting. Each year at town meeting the voters approve warrant articles that spell out what they want done during the upcoming year; the Selectmen are ultimately responsible for the expenditures, personnel, policies, contracts, etc. that are needed to implement those town meeting votes.

Northfield has a three member Selectboard. One member is elected each March to a three year term.

The Selectboard meets on Tuesday evenings as needed. Generally the Board meets every Tuesday except during summer months when the Board meets on the first and third Tuesday of the month. Please check the website calendar for upcoming meetings.
