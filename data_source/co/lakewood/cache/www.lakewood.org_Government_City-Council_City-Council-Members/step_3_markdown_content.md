## Additional Information

**City Structure:** Lakewood has a Council/Manager form of government, as established in the[*City Charter*(PDF, 212KB)](https://www.lakewood.org/files/assets/public/v/1/city-clerks-office/pdfs/municipal-code/charter.pdf "Charter.pdf"). Some sections referenced in the Charter are also governed by the [**City Council Policies and Procedures Manual(PDF, 544KB)**](https://www.lakewood.org/files/assets/public/v/4/city-council/documents/lakewood-city-council-policies-and-procedures-final-approved-8132024.pdf "2018 Policies & Procedures Manual") that helps define how the Council operates.

The Council appoints the [City Manager](https://www.lakewood.org/Government/Departments/City-Managers-Office) with administrative responsibility to carry out the Council's policies and the day-to-day operations of the City.

[See the City Manager's Quarterly Video Report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr8dWWlDvR8 "See the City Manager's Quarterly Video Report")

See upcoming meeting topics and agendas, minutes of past meetings, and watch Council meeting live or past Council meetings by visiting [City Council Meeting Information](https://www.lakewood.org/Government/City-Council/City-Council-Upcoming-Meetings).

**Submitting Comments to Council and the Community:** Again, if you would like to contact City Council on any issue or a specific issue scheduled for an upcoming City Council meeting, you can submit public comments via [LakewoodSpeaks.org](https://lakewoodspeaks.org).
