Laura Light-[Kovács](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kov%C3%A1cs), a Colorado native raised in Loveland, discovered her fervor for public service early in life. In college she worked for the Loveland Public Library, discovering a love for service to her community.

Furthering her education, Laura graduated summa cum laude with a master's degree in educational leadership, renewal, and change, setting the stage for a 12-year tenure as a high school social studies teacher. Working with students and families from diverse backgrounds helped prepare Laura to be a tireless advocate for all people and to value the rich experiences that come from working with diverse populations. Laura is still passionate about working with young people and is a vehement supporter of our public schools. During her teaching career Laura sponsored the National Honor Society club, founded the yoga and anime clubs, and coordinated the AVID program; a college-readiness initiative for first-generation college students.
