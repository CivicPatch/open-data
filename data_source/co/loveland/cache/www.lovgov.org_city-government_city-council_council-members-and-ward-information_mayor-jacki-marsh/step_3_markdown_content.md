**Biography**

Jacki Marsh was elected Mayor of Loveland in November of 2017. As a small business owner in downtown Loveland she became a close observer of Loveland civic affairs. She attended virtually every City Council meeting for a three-year period prior to her decision to seek election as Mayor.

At the age of 17, Jacki won the world’s first women’s six-mile race, the Crazyleg’s Mini-Marathon in New York’s Central Park in 1972. Three weeks after that ground-breaking race, Title IX was signed into Law; guaranteeing women equal funding and equal opportunities in all federally funded schools. Today, the New York Mini Marathon is the world’s premier women’s road race. The New York Mini is run annually and has over eight thousand female runners each year. Olympians from around the world gather to compete in this prestigious women’s race.

In addition to her Mayoral duties, Jacki is a small business owner. In her prior professional life, Jacki has worn many hats, some include: Early Childhood Teacher for the Department of Social Services, Bookkeeper for a Dental Clinic, Trade Show Marketing Manager, Purchasing Manager and Purchasing Director for an International Software Company and General Manger for a large Home Service Provider.

As Mayor, Jacki is active in our community and can routinely be found lending a hand at KidsPak, attending Veteran breakfasts, &amp; Veteran events, school events, regional meetings and serving on several Boards and Commissions.

 Mayor Marsh is committed to transparency, equality and being responsive to Loveland residents; she seldom turns aside invitations to appear and to join in civic events.
