Information regarding the Mayor and each Trustee is listed below.

Ron Granger, Mayor

![Ron Granger, Mayor](https://townofrangely.colorado.gov/sites/townofrangely/files/inline-images/Ron%20Granger%20Head%20Shoot_0.jpg)

Currently I am a retired President from Colorado Northwestern Community College; however, I remain as a professor for the Business Program.  My wife, Alisa, daughter, Samantha, and I moved to Rangely in August of 2016 when I took the position as President of Colorado Northwestern Community College.  We moved to Rangely from Riverton, WY, but both Alisa and I grew up in Southwest Missouri and lived there for several years before we moved to Wyoming. 

Most of my adult life has been spent in education with over 25 years in higher education and 11 years at the high school level.  Besides being President at CNCC, I have served as a professor, Division Chair, Dean and Vice President at Crowder College in Missouri and as Vice President at Central Wyoming College in Riverton.    I also taught business for a few years at Southern Utah University in Cedar City, Utah.  Besides my work in education, I was the CFO for a construction company in El Paso, TX.  We worked exclusively for oil refineries throughout Texas and New Mexico.  I received my BS degree in Business Education from Missouri Southern State University and my Masters degree in Educational Administration from Missouri State University. 

When we moved to Rangely, we immediately fell in love with the town and the people.  We knew that we wanted to make Rangely our home even after my retirement.  Since we have been here both Alisa and I have served on several boards and been involved in many community events. 

Our biggest joy in life are our kids and grandkids.  We have a total of 8 children living in Idaho, Utah, Missouri, and Wyoming and also have 16 grandkids and 1 great granddaughter.  

Andy Shaffer, Pro Tem

![Andy Shaffer portrait](https://townofrangely.colorado.gov/sites/townofrangely/files/styles/extra_large_thumbnail_650x650_/public/Andy%20Shaffer.PNG)

I moved to Rangely in the fall of 1990 to attend the CNCC Aviation program. I spent two years in the program, graduating in 1992, with an Associates of Applied Science Degree in Aviation Technology, achieving a CFI and CFII.  In the fall of the following year I took a position as an instructor at CNCC in the Aviation program.  

I then spent several years working for Ducey Electric as an apprentice electrician.  In 1997 I went to work for Brenton Service Company where I earned my Journeyman Electrical License.  A year later, seeking opportunities to provide a better lifestyle for my family, I transitioned into the natural gas field. Twenty-two years later I still believe I made the right decision.  

I volunteered on the Rangely Fire Department for 27 years.  I also served on Rangley’s Town Council for six years, four as a councilman and two as Mayor.

I have a son and a daughter.  My daughter, Sidney, graduated from the CNCC Nursing Program and is an RN.  My son, Braxton, attends school in Rangely.  He enjoys riding his dirt bike, playing basketball, baseball and wake surfing.

During my first year of college I could not wait to return to the flat lands I came from and get out of these rolling hills and mountains.  Like many college students I spent my time on campus and did not venture down to town much. The summer between my first and second year of college I chose to stay in Rangely.  During this time I realized what Rangely and the surrounding area had to offer. I have now been in Rangely for more than 30 years and I would not change a thing. I am glad I have been able to raise my family here.

I think Rangely is a great small community.  The lifestyle benefits associated with our size are a primary reason why people enjoy living here. Rangely is an industry-based community which has cyclical ups and downs. Because of this we need to focus on diversifying our community in order to help keep the economy going during industrial down times. There is no easy solution to this given our location. But if we seek to capitalize on our unique BLM surroundings in order to promote Rangely we may find some success.

Improving our community also means keeping the employees that work in our area living in our area.  We must accept the challenges facing Rangely and strive to show the world the many reasons why Rangely is truly Way Outside of Ordinary.
