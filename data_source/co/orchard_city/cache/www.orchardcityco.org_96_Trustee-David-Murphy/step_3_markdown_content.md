Orchard City resident David Murphy was elected in April 2024 to serve a four-year term on our Board of Trustees. 

Hello!

My name is David Murphy, and I am a 4th generation Coloradoan, and I love Colorado!  My wife Katt and I have now lived in Eckert CO for 6 years and we love it. We moved here and found what we loved so much – the people!

I think folks often move to get away from where they currently live seeking to find a place that lets them live without the anxiety, stress and chaos that has infiltrated where they live now. Likewise, there are those that have lived here for many years, and they also hope to hold on to what they value most in their home and community.

Change is going to occur, that’s a given, but I believe it can occur with careful and responsible consideration of everyone the issues affect.

I believe we can work together and listen to each other. Together we can share a way of life that many have had and lost, and still make tough decisions to protect what makes this community so very special.

We are going through some challenging times.  Let’s make a commitment to each other that we will listen and do our utmost to address all the concerns with open minds and respect.

I challenge everyone that lives in Orchard City to join us in our meetings; let us get to know you and your concerns, together finding creative ways to work together.

I humbly and respectfully thank you for allowing me this opportunity to represent Orchard City CO and look forward to being a trustee working with a great team.

David Murphy

Trustee Murphy serves the Town on the Personal Committee and Planning Commission.
