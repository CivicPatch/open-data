   1. Proof of residency doesn't need to be physical, it can be digital. It just needs to be shown to staff

2. **For the Phone App**
   
   1. Download the RTD MyRide App on your smartphone through the [**Google Play Store**(opens in new window)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.justride.rtddenver&pli=1) or the [**Apple App Store**(opens in new window)](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/rtd-myride/id1302195466)
   2. Create a new account by clicking the "account" tab in the app
      
      1. Be sure to use the same email address that you provide to Town Staff

### Using Your EcoPass

As you board the bus or arrive to the light rail platform, scan the QR code on the phone app or tap your EcoPass card on the validator. Wait for the green "Valid" screen to appear, take your seat, and enjoy the ride.

What this video from RTD on how to scan your QR code or card properly:

###### **How much money does EcoPass save compared to driving my car to work?**

Taking transportation modes alternative to a car is a great way to save money - even better with an EcoPass, which allows for unlimited trips. Think about all the expenses related to your car: Gasoline/EV charging rates, maintenance, inspections, registration, car insurance, car payments, toll fares, and parking fees. Under these circumstances, EcoPass is paying for itself in less than one month! The [AAA 2023 Driving Cost Study(opens in new window)](https://newsroom.aaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/YDC-Fact-Sheet-FINAL-8.30.23-1.pdf) explains just how expensive commuting by car can be.

What is an Acceptable form  of ID?

- State Issued Driver’s License (does not have to be issued by Colorado, but cannot be expired)
- State Issued ID
- Passport

What is Acceptable Proof of Residency?

- An official lease – Hand-written leases, month-to-month leases and letters from landlords are not accepted. 60+ days must still be on the lease
- A current utility bill dated within 60 days
- A credit card or bank statement dated within 60 days with your physical property address listed. A letter from your bank or other types of documentation will not be accepted

Please check to make sure the physical address is listed. **A Nederland PO Box does not demonstrate proof of residency.**

**Please note:** A driver’s license with a Nederland PO Box or physical address WILL NOT count as proof of residency.

**\*NOTE* As of September 1st 2023, youth 19 and under ride at no cost! To ride free, you must show one of the following to the bus operator or fare inspector:**

- Current school ID
- Valid government-issued ID
- Alien registration/permanent resident card
- Military ID/dependent card with date-of-birth
- RTD-issued youth special discount card

## FAQ

### Can I Have both a Card and the Phone App?

**Currently, you can only pick one or the other.**

RTD's MyRide system is used to host multiple passes per account. As of right now, it can only recognize one EcoPass per account. In the future, we hope that users will be able to have both the physical card and the phone app.

### Does my EcoPass expire?

**No! As long as you live in** [**Nederland Community Library District,**](https://bouldercounty.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=ede6dd29a51e4ad687174394f7a047cc) **your card is valid.**

- If you move out of the [Nederland Community Library District](https://bouldercounty.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=ede6dd29a51e4ad687174394f7a047cc), you are no longer eligible to use the pass and you must return it to Town Hall.
- If you are a renter or are otherwise living on a property you do not personally own, you must come in to Town Hall to re-demonstrate proof of residency **every year**. Failure to re-demonstrate proof will result in your pass being suspended until proof of residency can be provided.

### Where is my EcoPass Valid?

**All EcoPass holders are eligible for unlimited rides on RTD transit services, including:**

- Local Buses
- Regional Buses
- SkyRide service to and from DIA
- The 'N' to Eldora Mountain Ski Resort
- All Community Transit Network buses in Boulder, like the Hop, Skip, Jump, Bound, and Dash
- All Light Rail and Commuter Rail
- All Call-n-Ride services

## Nederland Eco Pass Public Improvement District Advisory Committee (NEPPIDAC)

The NEPPIDAC is an independent advisory committee that provides Boulder County Commissioners with recommendations regarding the administration of the Nederland EcoPass Public Improvement District.

While the Board of County Commissioners (BOCC) has the legal authority and responsibility to make decisions regarding the operation and finances of the District, Committee members serve in an advisory capacity to the BOCC. The Committee acts as a communication link between the property owners and residents of the District and the BOCC; and advises Boulder County transportation staff on issues related to the implementation of the public improvements serving the District.
