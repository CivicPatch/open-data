## Council Voting Records

On February 5, 2024, City Council approved a motion to add the City Council voting history to the City’s website for public transparency. While all votes of the City Council are public and may be found in the official Minutes of each City Council meeting, this voting dashboard provides the public the ability to sort and filter City Council action in many ways. Users can look through all actions taken by the City Council starting on July 1, 2024 and move through each Councilmember’s page to see their voting record on agenda items.
