## MAYOR LAURA WEINBERG

I am honored to be Golden’s mayor and to have the opportunity to represent our wonderful community. We have a beautiful city filled with amenities for all interests, strong neighborhoods, thriving businesses, a world-class university, and excellent municipal services.

My focus for our city is on continuous improvement in the ways that City Council operates, the ways that the city connects with residents and businesses, and the ways in which we collaborate to bring new ideas and creative solutions to fruition.

I invite everyone to become involved in shaping our future. From serving on city boards and commissions to filling out a survey on GuidingGolden.com, there are varying levels of time commitment and various topics of interest and all are important to crafting the city that we desire.

Please stay in touch via email, phone, or Facebook ([**@LauraforGolden**](https://www.facebook.com/lauraforgolden)). I welcome your creative ideas and look forward to working together for the good of Golden.

## COUNCILOR LISA VITRY, District 1

I am honored to serve the residents and businesses of our great City as District 1 City Councilor. I am humbled by your passion to continue to make Golden a place where you and your family can thrive. I look forward to representing your voices on City Council and engaging with you to collaborate and develop ideas to navigate the opportunities and challenges we will face in the next four years. I am confident our entire city can unite as one community to support each other, our local businesses, and our first responders.

As a board-certified medical technologist with 30 years of clinical and leadership experience, I am excited for our residents to have a fire department that can respond faster and provide service and support for increasingly critical medical emergencies.

I believe we need to be stewards of land and protect and preserve our open space. I look forward to representing the community when engaging with the Parks, Recreation and Golf division on their many projects, including the Open Space Master Plan. Golden is located in the Wildland Urban Interface, and our open space, parks, views and vistas are what make our city a beautiful place to live.

I am confident our City will provide more social support and resources for our seniors. I have participated in meetings and focus groups that I believe will have tangible and sustainable outcomes.

We are a kind, inclusive, and resilient community. I believe this is the character and culture of our great city that will never be extinguished, as long as we continue to work together and support each other.

Thank you for the opportunity to work with you and represent and support your voice.

## COUNCILOR PATTY EVANS, District 2

I’m honored to have the privilege of representing District 2 on your City Council. I’ve lived in downtown Golden for 15 years, and I have served on the Planning Commission for nearly 10 years. I look forward to bringing that experience and perspective to Council.

Throughout the election season, I spent a lot of time knocking on doors and talking to people. In all my conversations, I heard common themes—a desire to maintain our small-town character, concerns about the impact of visitors, and overall, an optimism about Golden’s future. I’m embracing that optimism in my new role as Councilor.

Golden has lots of opportunities and challenges in front of us, both short- and long-term. We can tackle big-picture questions around how our community grows and our values for Golden, while also being responsive to short-term issues that affect the day-to-day lives of our residents. I’m looking forward to rolling up my sleeves and digging in.

We are a better community when we’re united and see the best in each other. I’m hopeful for our future and excited to represent District 2 on Council.

## COUNCILOR ROBERT REED, Ward 1

Rob Reed is a Jefferson County native and graduate of Golden High School, where he was captain of the soccer team. Because he wanted to see if he could make a Division I soccer team, Rob decided to attend the University of the Pacific, where he majored in journalism and political science/pre-law, played soccer, raced on the ski team and helped form the ski club.

After graduating from college, Rob spent a year working in a small advertising and public relations firm before returning to Colorado to attend law school at the University of Colorado. After graduating and passing the bar exam, Rob worked for two specialty firms that focused on mortgage lending and servicing. In 1997 Rob started his own practice, which focuses on real estate law. Rob has represented people and businesses throughout Colorado in real estate transactions and litigation. Rob has also done pro bono legal work for organizations that assist women in crisis and families in need.

Rob and his wife, Kristin, got married at Table Mountain Inn almost 20 years ago (Rob’s parents were married in front of the same fireplace before TMI was TMI). Rob and Kristin moved to Golden in 2003.

## COUNCILOR PAUL HASEMAN, Ward 2

Preserving the true character of Golden continues to be my goal and the goal of the Council. This goal is only made possible by our many, many volunteers who, working together, make Golden Golden. Thank you all for your contributions to our great City. We should all be proud and thankful.

By way of brief background, I graduated West Point as an officer in the Corps of Engineers. After Vietnam and teaching at the Army Engineer School, my career shifted to law with two law degrees and work in the aerospace industry for 30 years. My last position was Vice President and General Counsel for $3B company. This broad corporate experience reinforces the value of communication and teamwork.

My wife, Vivian, and I are happy to enjoy Golden with our daughter Lynn and family. My other daughter, Janelle, and her family live in Colorado Springs and my son, Mark, and his family live in Littleton. Life is good in Golden.

## COUNCILOR DON CAMERON, Ward 3

During my time in Golden, I have been highly involved in civic and community activities, ranging from service as Chair of the City of Golden’s Planning Commission to advocating for sustainability work in the city.

Recently, I’ve been working as co-chair of the Golden United Housing Task Force. This group of citizens is self-organized and advocates for affordable housing issues in town. I was also a member of the Golden Investment Forum Task Force, and served on the Utility Rates Task Force as a representative of the Golden Planning Commission. We created an equitable water rate plan that shares the costs, the capital investments, and encourages conservation.

Many of you have seen me demonstrate preparedness, bring hard questioning, recommend intelligent improvements to city codes, and introduce suggestions to resolutions to help guide our city’s growth in a smart and commonsense manner. The breadth of my civic service has given me the knowledge of the issues and the experience of dealing with the tough problems that will serve me well on Council.

Thank you for supporting and trusting my candidacy during the recent Special Election for Ward 4. Golden is worth it! With an unprecedented voter turnout, the message is clear: we care about and remain engaged in maintaining Golden and moving forward.
