# Steve Muntean - At Large

![Muntean_Steve](https://www.steamboatsprings.net/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=30344)Councilor Steve Muntean was elected to the two-year At-Large seat during the November 2023 election. For over 34 years, Muntean and his wife have run the Muntean Leadership Group, which helps organizations vision their future, identify initiatives &amp; strategies to achieve that vision, develop win-win partnerships, collaborate &amp; communicate effectively, and develop leaders that have a solution focused leadership style.

Muntean knows Steamboat Springs well and the needs of various groups and stakeholders. The last 12 years, he has worked with over 100 local businesses and more than 20 non-profits, city departments including finance, planning and IT, county department managers as well as the commissioners, the school board, and Leadership Steamboat.

He is also a board member of the LMD (local marketing district) and board member of The Health Partnership, which connects people to health and wellness resources so that they live longer healthier lives. In addition, he was the co-chair of the Yes to Education campaign which resulted in building the Sleeping Giant school.

Muntean feels the focus of City Council should be to identify and implement the best solutions to address Steamboat Springs’ challenges and opportunities, which will enrich our culture, character and lifestyle - affordable housing, managing growth, promoting mental and behavior health services, environmental sustainability and increase council's team effectiveness.
