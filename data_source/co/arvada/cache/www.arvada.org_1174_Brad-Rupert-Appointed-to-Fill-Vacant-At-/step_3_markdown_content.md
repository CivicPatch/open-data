# Brad Rupert Appointed to Fill Vacant At-Large City Council Seat

**Dec. 18, 2024** - The Arvada City Council is proud to announce the appointment of Brad Rupert to the at-large City Council seat. A resident of the community for over 40 years, Rupert has dedicated 30 years to public service through numerous volunteer and appointed roles, showcasing his extensive leadership experience and commitment to the city.

Rupert‚Äôs background includes service as a member and chair of the Arvada Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors, leadership on the Jefferson County Board of Education, and work with the Colorado State Board Community Colleges and Occupational Education. He has also supported housing opportunities through his longstanding involvement with Habitat for Humanity and provided critical resources to local families through service with the Community Table.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm honored to step into this role and continue serving the community I‚Äôve proudly called home,‚Äù Rupert said. ‚ÄúArvada has given so much to my family and me, and I‚Äôm eager to give back by addressing key challenges and ensuring a bright future for all residents.‚Äù

Mayor Lauren Simpson expressed her enthusiasm for Rupert‚Äôs appointment. ‚ÄúBrad‚Äôs extensive history of civic engagement and proven leadership make him an ideal choice to represent our community at-large,‚Äù said Simpson. ‚ÄúAll four of our finalists were compelling candidates; Arvada was blessed to have such a talented, committed group ready to serve. The interview responses were very, very impressive ‚Äî this was not an easy choice! Even so, with his experience as an attorney plus his two terms elected to JeffCo School Board, Brad‚Äôs deep understanding of the role of a councilmember and the work we do for the community made the difference. His ability to hit the ground running will greatly benefit our Council and residents alike.‚Äù

Rupert‚Äôs professional expertise further strengthens his contributions to the Council. A retired attorney with over two decades of practice in business, real estate, and estate planning law, he has successfully navigated complex issues involving property rights, contracts and local ordinances. Rupert also co-founded a private ambulance company, demonstrating his entrepreneurial spirit and focus on community needs.

Mr. Rupert will serve the remainder of the unexpired term, which began upon his taking the Oath of Office on Dec. 16, 2024 and continues until the City of Arvada‚Äôs next regular election in November 2025. ¬†
