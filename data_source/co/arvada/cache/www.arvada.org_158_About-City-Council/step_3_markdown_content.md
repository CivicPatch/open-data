1. [Rules that Guide City Council](https://www.arvada.org/158/About-City-Council/)

## City Charter

The City Charter is the city's establishing document. It is like the constitution for the city. Among its provisions are two sections about the City Council.

[Chapter IV](https://library.municode.com/co/arvada/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTICH_CHIVCICO) sets out the roles, responsibilities, powers, qualifications, and limitations of the City Council. Portions of this chapter are summarized below.

[Chapter V](https://library.municode.com/co/arvada/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTICH_CHVCICOPR) gives direction for the procedures of City Council. Topics include frequency of meetings, quorum rules, as well as various guidelines for voting and codification of the City Code.

## Administrative Rules

Subject to the limitations in the City Charter, City Council may adopt administrative rules or regulations governing administrative procedures and the application of a law to aid in the administration and enforcement of ordinances.

When proposed rules have been prepared under this article, a public hearing shall be held upon not less than ten days' published notice, which notice shall state the general topic of regulation, the location and time of hearing and that copies of the proposed rules are available at the office of the City Clerk. The adopting authority, or his designee, shall preside at the hearing and shall receive such evidence and argument as may be presented.

Subsequent to such hearing the proposed rules may be revised as deemed appropriate and shall then be transmitted to City Council for approval by resolution. Such rules shall become effective upon approval by the City Council. (Code 1960, § 2-52; Code 1981, § 2-123)

The City Clerk shall maintain for public inspection during regular business hours copies of all rules in effect under this article and shall furnish copies of rules to the public at a price not to exceed copying expense.

Any rule promulgated under this article shall remain in effect until revocation by the adopting authority, upon notice to the City Clerk. (Code 1960, § 2-54; Code 1981, § 2-125)

## City Council Policy

The Arvada City Council is responsible for establishing [policies](https://library.municode.com/co/arvada/munidocs/munidocs?nodeId=77eecbf0c9f80) to guide the various functions of the City Council and, when necessary, establishing performance procedures for those policies. With the adoption of each policy, the Council sets out its purpose, definition, procedures, and other information deemed necessary to provide a history of the policy statement as well as a cross reference with an adopted Ordinance, Resolution or Motion.

Specific procedures contained within a policy statement are intended to guide, rather than dictate, a specific course of action by the City Council. Accordingly, any procedures established by a written policy may be modified by the Council, at their sole discretion, if it is determined that there are substantial and justified reasons for doing so. Any written policy may be temporarily suspended by majority vote of all Councilmembers present, and any written policy may be amended, re-enacted or repealed by majority vote of all Councilmembers present.

1. [Roles that City Council plays](https://www.arvada.org/158/About-City-Council/)

## As a Legislative body

City Council has the authority to pass ordinances that have general applicability to the City as a whole, rather than to one person or property. Legislation may stem from the need for improvement in existing law, or to address new or changing circumstances. Legislative actions include changes made by ordinance to the City Code or the Land Development Code.

## As a Quasi-Judicial Body

City Council makes their decision based upon applying the evidence presented during a public hearing to criteria pre-established by the law. Many quasi-judicial hearings involve site-specific land-use matters, such as rezoning or a preliminary development plan. Due process requires safeguards such as advance notice, a public hearing, and an opportunity to be heard by decision-makers who are unbiased. Also, direct communication between councilmembers and interested parties is prohibited when Council acts as a quasi-judicial body.

## As an Administrative Body

Issuing a license, in contrast, would be considered administrative. Usually accomplished by city staff, and without a public hearing, administrative actions may be thought of as the necessary, but often mundane, exercise of "crossing the t's and dotting the i's."
