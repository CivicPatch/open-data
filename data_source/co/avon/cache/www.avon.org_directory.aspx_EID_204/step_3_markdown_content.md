# Lindsay Hardy

 

[Town Council &amp; Mayor](https://www.avon.org/Directory.aspx?DID=8)  
Title: Town Council Member  
[Email](mailto:lhardy@avon.org)

Lindsay L. Hardy was born in Panama City Beach, Florida, where her great grandfather planned, developed, and sold real estate in the early years of Panama City. This family involvement in developing a community inspired Lindsay to go to Architecture School at the University of Miami and focus her studies on New Urbanism and Town Planning, with a double major in European History.

In 2010, after Architecture School, Lindsay moved to Avon, and for her first year she worked seasonal ski and golf jobs. After her first year she soon joined a Local Architecture firm, and shortly after was commissioned to the Town of Avon’s Planning and Zoning Commission (PNZ). Lindsay sat on PNZ for 8 years, 4 of those as Chairperson, until elected onto the Avon Town Council in late 2020. She loves the incredible possibilities in the design and growth of Avon, and enjoyed being involved in the local community through PNZ.

Lindsay also previously worked for a local subcontractor in Custom Fenestration as a Project Manager, obtaining a better understanding of high-end construction and its processes. She also holds a Colorado Real Estate License, previously sat on the Traer Creek Design Review Board (DRB) for 4 years representing the Town of Avon, and has done Real Estate Development Consulting. Lindsay currently works for an Avon based Architecture firm, Zehren &amp; Associates.

In Architecture school one of her projects, “South Florida in the Era of Climate Change,” went on to a Global Conference in Istanbul on Global Climate Change; and the following year, her preservation, revitalization, and planning efforts on preserving a local Miami Treasure was successfully listed on America’s 11 Most Endangered Historic Places, as a National Treasure, and was later listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Lindsay has always prided herself for her passion and enthusiasm with Architecture, Construction, Social Urbanism and the Built Environment.

In her pastime, Lindsay loves being outdoors; you can find her Hiking 14ers, Climbing, Golfing, Skiing, River Rafting, Traveling, and Exploring the World. And of course cheering on her Miami Hurricanes Football!

She is also involved in a Charity close to her heart, B the Difference, and often volunteers with Habitat for Humanity and SBP, in efforts to rebuild after disaster or help build local affordable housing.

Lindsay is excited to continue her passions locally and looks forward to participating at a higher level in nurturing Avon’s future.

As an Architect, you design for the present, with an awareness of the past, for a future which is essentially unknown. – Norman Foster

Lindsay believes the same should be applied to government.

Lindsay priorities include: Smart Growth, Responsible Community Development, Retaining Young Locals within the Community, Affordable Housing, Walk &amp; Bike-ability, Culture &amp; Arts, and Fiscal Responsibility.
