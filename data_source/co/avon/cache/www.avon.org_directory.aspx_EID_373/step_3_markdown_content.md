# Gary Brooks

 

[Town Council &amp; Mayor](https://www.avon.org/Directory.aspx?DID=8)  
Title: Avon Town Councilmember  
[Email](mailto:gbrooks@avon.org)

Gary L. Brooks was born in Oklahoma and at the age of 7 moved to Brisbane Australia with his family when his father was transferred there for his work.   After a 4-year stint abroad, Gary returned to Tulsa where he graduated from high school in 1973 then he enrolled in the University of Tulsa then transferred to Oklahoma State University where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Geology in 1977.    

Gary landed a job working as a wellsite geologist in Saudi Arabia for 2 years after college then returned to the states and took a job with Phillips Petroleum Company in Odessa, Texas where he worked as a Development Geologist from 1980 until 1986 when he was laid off during a major downturn in the oil business.    He moved to Avon in 1986 to become a better skier but soon fell in love with the Eagle River Valley and after working as a lift operator and in a ski shop for several years, landed a job as a Land Surveyor with Alpine Engineering in Edwards.

Gary was employed by Alpine from 1989 until 2016 as a surveyor then as a project manager    He and his partners bought the company from the original owners in 2016 and was an owner of Alpine until he retired in 2022.  As a project manager, Gary oversaw the design, permitting, entitling and construction of the majority of the Eagle Ranch and Haymeadow  subdivisions in Eagle along with numerous additional projects throughout the Eagle River and Gore Creek Valleys.    He specialized in overall project management including roadway and utility design, stormwater and water quality facilities design, subdivision platting and including permitting through local, state and federal agencies.    After he retired from Alpine Engineering, he then founded Cutthroat Consulting, LLC as an engineering consulting firm specializing in providing due diligence analysis and permitting support for community housing projects throughout the valley.

Gary has been on the board of the Eagle River Coalition (formerly known as the Eagle River Watershed Council) for over 7 years and currently serves as the board Vice President.  He has also been on the Eagle County Housing and Development Authority Board for over 8 years and has served on the ECO Trails board for 2 years.   Gary and his wife Linn are Colorado Master Gardeners and regularly volunteer with the Eagle County Conservation District and CSU Extension Center's Beyond Lawn turf replacement program.   

Gary lived in Avon from 1986 until 1993 then bought a home in Eagle where he lived until 2007 when he married his wife Linn and moved to Wildridge.    In his spare time, you can find him fly fishing local rivers and high-country lakes or upland bird hunting with his two English Springer Spaniels Zoee and JuJu.
