## **The Future Is Looking Bright!**

**Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends and Members of the Las Animas Community,**

It is an absolute pleasure to write to you today in this vibrant community that we call home. As we approach the end of March and close in on the first quarter of the year, I want to take a moment to reflect on the exciting developments we’ve witnessed and the bright future that lies ahead for Las Animas.

First and foremost, let us celebrate our new city council member, Richard Stwalley, who has joined our team. This is not just a change in leadership; it’s a fresh breeze of ideas, energy, and commitment to our community’s needs. We have someone at the helm who is ready to listen and advocate for us all, ensuring our voices are heard and our concerns addressed. Together, we will work towards innovative solutions and improvements that will benefit every resident.

Speaking of improvements, I am thrilled to announce the opening of our new playground for the kids! Isn’t it wonderful to see our children laughing, playing, and making memories? This playground is not just a structure; it’s a space that fosters creativity, friendship, and physical activity. It represents our dedication to providing a safe, fun environment for our youngest community members, and I look forward to seeing many families enjoying this beautiful addition!

As we look forward, I am excited to share that we are edging closer to realizing our idea of a recreation hub in Las Animas. This facility will be a cornerstone of our community—offering a place for fitness, sports, community events, and social gatherings. It’s about more than just a project; it’s about building connections, strengthening relationships, and enhancing the quality of life right here in our town.

And speaking of quality of life, let’s take a moment to appreciate the warmer weather that is upon us. As the days grow longer and the sun shines brighter, we are reminded of the beauty of our surroundings and the opportunities that come with each new season. Warmer weather means more time spent outdoors, more community events, and more chances to connect with one another.

I also want to commend our team for completing the financial audit for the city. This is a significant milestone! It reflects our commitment to transparency and responsible governance. A thorough audit means we are on a solid financial footing, allowing us to invest in our community’s future with confidence and integrity. Together, we are ensuring that our resources are managed wisely, paving the way for a prosperous tomorrow.

Now, let’s talk about our infrastructure. I am pleased to announce that we have new paving equipment on the way! This investment will allow us to address our road conditions more efficiently and effectively. Smooth, safe roads are vital for residents and visitors alike, and I assure you that we are committed to maintaining and improving our town’s infrastructure.

As we look ahead to April, let’s get excited about our annual Santa Fe Trail Day! This tradition is more than just a celebration; it’s a chance to unite in our rich history, showcase local talent, and promote community spirit. I invite each of you to participate, whether by volunteering, setting up a booth, or simply joining in the festivities. Together, we can ensure this event is a resounding success!

Lastly, I want to touch on the ongoing construction improvements on Highway 50 through our town. This project is crucial for enhancing traffic flow and safety, and while it may be an inconvenience at times, it ultimately represents progress and a commitment to our community’s growth. Let’s be patient and supportive as we navigate these changes together, knowing that they will lead to a safer and more efficient travel experience for all.

In closing, I want to express my gratitude to each of you. Your involvement, your enthusiasm, and your commitment to our community are what make Las Animas truly special. Let’s continue to work together, share our ideas, and lift each other up. The future is bright, and I am honored to stand shoulder to shoulder with all of you as we build a community that we can all be proud of.

Thank you!

Mayor Charles Shupe
