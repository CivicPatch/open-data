   I am dedicated to community and country. I have extensive experience in working with local, state and federal entities in a variety of team and leadership roles.

It is important that our town’s mission, vision, goals, strategic plan and core values remain consistent, so our residents are served by local government and our town remains a beautiful place to live.
