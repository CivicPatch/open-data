   ### **About Mayor Rivero**
   
   Joshua Rivero was elected in 2024 as Parker’s eighth Mayor since the Town’s incorporation in 1981. A longtime resident and dedicated community member, he previously served three terms on the Parker Town Council (2012-16, 2016-20, 2021-24). His passion for Parker is reflected in his commitment to preserving the town’s traditions while ensuring its future prosperity.
   
   As Mayor, Rivero serves as the spokesperson for the Town Council and plays an active role in state-level leadership. He is currently on the Executive Board of the Colorado Municipal League (CML), which represents 270 cities and towns across Colorado. He was appointed to the Board in January 2024 to fill a mid-term vacancy and was subsequently elected for a full term lasting through 2026.
   
   Rivero is a strong advocate for Parker’s economic growth and is also a local business owner. He opened Fika Coffee House in downtown Parker in 2008 and later expanded with a second location in his Idyllwilde neighborhood in 2015.
   
   In addition to his work as Mayor, Rivero has long been involved in the Parker community. He served as president of the Downtown Development Council, the precursor to Parker's Downtown Business Alliance, prior to joining the Town Council. He is also a former president of the Rotary Club of Parker – Cherry Creek Valley.
   
   Rivero originally moved to Parker in 1989 as a teen and graduated from Ponderosa High School in 1990. He and his wife, Anna, along with their children, August and Astrid, reside in the Idyllwilde neighborhood, where they have lived since 2006. He enjoys the Colorado outdoors, with hobbies including cycling, hiking, kayaking, golf and disc golf.
