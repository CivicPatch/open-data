Graham is a proud, born and raised Puebloan. She attended South High School and began her college career at the University of Northern Colorado. Graham later earned a psychology degree with a minor in statistics from Colorado State University Pueblo in 2011.

At the age of 25, Graham opened her first restaurant Graham’s Grill which was first located on the Pueblo Riverwalk. Graham proceeded to open the southside location of Graham’s Grill in the Regency shopping center, closed the Riverwalk location and opened a northside Graham’s Grill near Belmont. After having two Graham’s Grill locations, she opened Ruby’s wine bar in Mesa Junction and the restaurant is named after her late bulldog Ruby.

Graham began her political career when she earned the At-Large City Council seat for Pueblo City Council in fall of 2021 and began her term in January of 2022. During her time on City Council, she served on the Historic Arkansas Riverwalk of Pueblo (HARP) Authority board, Pueblo Economic Develop Corporation (PEDCO) board, Pueblo Urban Renewal Authority (PURA) board, Latino Chamber of Commerce board, Airport Advisory Committee and the Pueblo Area Council of Government (PACOG) board. Graham helped organize twice-yearly community-wide clean ups with free trash dump days with her fellow councilors and attended hundreds of community events.

Graham received the 2023 Community Service Award from the Pueblo Downtown Association for her organization of clean-ups and attention to the downtown corridor. Graham served two years as City Council President before becoming the first woman mayor of Pueblo and winning the runoff election in January 2024.

Graham is married to her husband Danny Beaudry and together they have their French bulldog Lucy. In Graham’s spare time, she enjoys volunteering with community clean ups, walking around the Pueblo Riverwalk with her dog Lucy, attending Pueblo Bulls hockey games and enjoying Pueblo local restaurants.
