## About Councilmember Leinweber

David lives and breathes the outdoors – both recreationally and professionally. He has worked in the outdoor recreation industry for over 40 years, and with his wife, Becky, has owned and managed Angler’s Covey – a Colorado Springs specialty fly fishing shop, guide service, and learning center – over 26 years. Over the past few years, their daughter, Rachel, has taken over most of the operations of the family business. Angler’s Covey is one of the largest fly shops in the country and has received several awards for their innovation in the industry, support of the community, and outstanding customer service.

David and Becky have been married for 40 years and both are Colorado natives. They moved to Colorado Springs in 1991 with their twins, Rachel, and Jonathan, and lived in the Village Seven community until 2004 when they moved to the west side and expanded Angler’s Covey to its current location at 21st street and Cimarron/ Highway 24.

David’s involvement in the local community has been a consistent thread throughout his life. In 2016, David founded the Pikes Peak Outdoor Recreation Alliance (PPORA), partnering with Colorado Springs Chamber &amp; EDC and Visit Colorado Springs. PPORA works to strengthen the outdoor recreation industry for the Pikes Peak region through leadership and collaboration. PPORA was recognized as the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Southeast Region Partner of the Year for 2020 and the Rocky Mountain Field Institute Stewardship Partner of the Year in 2022 and leads the region’s Colorado Outdoor Regional Partnership. 

David has always felt that it’s important to engage in our community and give back. For example, in 2010 David started the Colorado Springs Fly Fishing Film Tour, an event that has raised over $20,000 each year for Project Healing Waters, a nonprofit that serves physically and mentally disabled active-duty military and veterans in the Pikes Peak region by providing fly fishing opportunities. In 2022 David founded a new fund under the Pikes Peak Community Foundation called “The Morning Hatch Foundation” with the mission of funding organizations and programs supporting the mental and emotional needs of the local community through transformational outdoor experiences that cultivate hope.
