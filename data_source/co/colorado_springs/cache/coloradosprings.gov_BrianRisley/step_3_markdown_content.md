## About Council President Pro Tem Risley

Brian’s diverse background and broad set of experiences brings significant value to his role on City Council.  As a 2015 alumni of the Colorado Springs Leadership Institute, Brian frequently relies upon his formal leadership training to guide his thought process and approach to critical issues.

A native of Colorado Springs, Brian was born and raised here and knows the values, goals and expectations of Colorado communities and he knows what obstacles the Front Range has faced as it has grown.  He has been directly involved in numerous issues facing our region over the years through his civic service on many boards and committees including the Colorado Springs Citizen’s Transportation Advisory Board and the PPRTA Citizen’s Advisory Committee.  Through his work with many local municipalities, Brian clearly understands the nuances and inner workings of local government. 

Both through his role as the Chair of the El Paso County Planning Commission and his professional involvement as an Architect and planning consultant, Brian has a commanding understanding of land use matters from all sides of an issue and has a track record of skillfully finding compromise and building consensus around complex land use projects.  A major component of his architectural practice includes evaluating impacts of proposed developments on the urban fabric surrounding a project and transportation and utility infrastructure related issues associated with development.  Often, his architectural firm is charged with master planning a development to accommodate current needs, while taking into account future growth. 

Brian’s practice has also involved working with a variety of project financing methods including public financing through local district bond and mill levy initiatives, municipal bond financing, and private equity funding.  Through his work with bond election teams across the state, hundreds of millions of dollars have been successfully secured for local school and municipal construction.

Brian is passionate about combining his professional expertise with targeted volunteer opportunities to positively impact community and drive measurable results.  One example of this was his work with the Pikes Peak YMCA as their Board Chair.  Under his leadership, the YMCA embarked on a Capital Campaign that resulted in expanding the Y’s mission and cause in our community through improved facilities, new service locations and enhanced connectivity to residents.
