## About Councilmember Henjum

Nancy Henjum is a 30-year resident of City Council District 5. Her dad was Joe Henjum, an Air Force pilot who was an instructor at the Air Force Academy where Nancy spent several years of her childhood. She received her Master of Social Work degree from Loyola University in Chicago, where she worked as a clinical therapist before moving with her husband to start a family in Colorado Springs. She and her husband, Steve Kern, a retired schoolteacher, have raised two children, now grown.

Nancy’s professional life in Colorado has included being the Chief Operations Officer for a public-private partnership that managed behavioral health services for 43 of the 63 counties in the state. She was also a faculty member at the Center for Creative Leadership, engaging in leadership development and executive coaching. She runs her own leadership consultancy business, working with a wide variety of organizations, both large and small, including energy companies, arts groups, non-profits, and civic entities.

Nancy has also served as a local volunteer-leader in many capacities: as board president for CASA (Court-Appointed Special Advocates); as facilitator with the Illumination Project promoting dialogue between law enforcement and community members; and as moderator of the council of First Congregational Church in downtown Colorado Springs.

Aside from being and working with people, Nancy’s greatest joy—as is true for many Coloradans—comes from nature and the outdoors: hiking, biking, birding, and gardening.
