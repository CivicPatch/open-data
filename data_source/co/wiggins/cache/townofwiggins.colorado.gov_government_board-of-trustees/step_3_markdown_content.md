## Wiggins Board of Trustees

The Town of Wiggins Board of Trustees is comprised of seven members. Of those seven members six are at-large trustees and one position for the Town mayor. The Board of Trustees are part-time elected officials, meaning that they have jobs in addition to their responsibilities as board members.

 

The Town of Wiggins Board of Trustees meetings are scheduled for the second and fourth Wednesday of each month. The public is encouraged and welcome to attend these meetings. If you cannot attend these meetings, however, we invite you to participate via the Zoom webinar link. 

The Town Board Meetings are held the 2nd and 4th Wednesdays of each month.  The 2nd Wednesday is a work session, and the 4th Wednesday is an active meeting with a public comment section on the agenda.
