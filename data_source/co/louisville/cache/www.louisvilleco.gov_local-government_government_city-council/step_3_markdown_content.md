The City Council is here to help you. Members are happy to answer questions and respond to your concerns. Listed below are the ways you may reach your Council person as a group or click on the specific member's photo for individual contact information.

 

As a home rule city operating under a council-manager form of government, the City Council is the governing body of the City. The [City Charter](https://www.louisvilleco.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/21931/638721246184530000) lays out the rules and regulations under which the City operates.

 

The Mayor is elected at-large and two council members are elected from each of the City's three wards, each to a four-year term.

 

If you would like to know in which ward you live, please check the [ward map](https://www.louisvilleco.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/864/638747898201500000). On the pdf map you can zoom in with great clarity. You may also call 303.335.4536.
