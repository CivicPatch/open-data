## The Role of City Council

The Lafayette City Council serves as the community’s legislative body, enacting ordinances, appropriating funds to conduct city business, and providing policy direction for city governance through the city administrator.

The Council consists of seven members who are elected on a non-partisan basis in odd-numbered years. Terms are staggered so the Council always consists of experienced members. Four seats must be filled each election year. The three councilors with the highest number of votes serve four-year terms and the fourth receives a two-year term.

The mayor and mayor pro-tem are selected by the City Council for two-year terms. Under provisions of the Lafayette City Charter, Council has the power to appoint the city administrator, city attorney, municipal court judge, city treasurer, and chief of police.

## City Council Meetings

City Council meets at 5:30pm on the 1st and 3rd Tuesday of each month at Lafayette City Hall, City Council Chambers, 1290 S. Public Road.
