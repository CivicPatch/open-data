# Mayor and Town Board

The Eaton Town Board is composed of six board members who are elected at-large on a non-partisan basis for four-year term, and a Mayor who is elected at-large for a four-year term. The terms are staggered so that three board seats are elected at one time and the other three seats, along with the Mayor, are elected two years later. The Mayor Pro-Tem is chosen from among the entire board and serves a term of two years.

The Board is the town's legislative body, having responsibility for enacting town ordinances, appropriating funds to conduct town business, and providing policy direction to town staff. The town board also serves as the Eaton Housing Authority Board of Directors, overseeing the operation of the Benjamin Square facility.

The Mayor is paid $250.00 per month for his/her efforts, and the Town Board members each earn $150.00 per month.

The Eaton Town Board meets on the third Thursday of each month for regular meetings at 7:00 PM in the Town Board Room, 224 First Street.
