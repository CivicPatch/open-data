49th Street Closure

In April, a culvert that conveys water from the Evans Ditch under 49th Street in the vicinity of 35th Avenue suffered a catastrophic failure forcing a road closure. Due to irrigation needs and utility constraints, repairs are scheduled for early fall after the irrigation season. 49th Street in this area will remain closed until repair work is completed. Thank you for your patience.
