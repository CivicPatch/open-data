### Biography

I am very fortunate to live in the beautiful mountain haven of Manitou Springs and to serve the community as a public servant on City Council.  My family moved to Colorado Springs in 1969 after my father, an officer in the US Army, returned from Viet Nam.  I fell in love with the mountains and with the eclectic town of Manitou, and vowed at an early age to live here permanently. Now, three generations of my family live here at the base of Pikes Peak.

I graduated from Palmer High School and Beth-El College of Nursing in Colorado Springs. Twenty-five years of my professional career has been as a RN and Nurse Practitioner. I hold a Bachelor and Masters Degree in Nursing, as well as several other professional certifications. I have been the successful owner and operator of two businesses; a primary care health and wellness clinic in Colorado Springs, and a Massage Therapy and Reiki practice in Manitou Springs.

Since relocating back to Manitou from downtown Colorado Springs, I have immersed myself in the community, finding many ways to be involved and volunteer my time. Prior to becoming an elected official, I started attending meetings and community gatherings to see where my passion for service lies. My priorities for our community include the challenges of climate change, protecting and preserving our trails and open spaces, and supporting the vibrant business and arts community that makes our town so unique.

In 2019, I joined the Environmental Work Group and became a board member of the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board (PARAB).  I am now looking forward to my new roles as liaison to the Open Space Advisory Committee (OSAC), Chair of the Climate Action Workgroup, and serving on the board of the Fireman’s Pension Fund.

In my spare time, my husband Rick and I are enjoying remodeling our little house near the Garden of the Gods, and spending time with our daughter, granddaughter, and three rescue dogs. We love the outdoors, especially our parks, and the hiking and cycling trails in and around our delightful town. I have done the incline more times than I can count, and ran the Pikes Peak Ascent race three times, placing twice in my age group! There is something for everyone in Manitou, regardless of age, interests, and abilities. I am honored to be a public servant of such a wonderful town!
