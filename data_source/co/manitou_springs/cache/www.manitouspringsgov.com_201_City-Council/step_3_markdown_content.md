## Overview

The Manitou Springs City Council is composed of 7 members. The Mayor serves a 2-year term while the other 6 Councilors serve overlapping 4-year terms. All 7 members are elected by the citizens. All Manitou Springs residents vote for the Mayor and the 3 At-Large Councilors. Only residents living within a Ward can vote for that Ward’s Councilor. 

If a Councilor resigns or is unable to continue in office, the City Council appoints a replacement member for the duration of the uncompleted term or until the next regular election. Councilors also serve as liaisons to various City boards and commissions, and other local and regional agencies.
