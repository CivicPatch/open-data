# Rick Stevens

 

[Town Council](https://www.basalt.net/Directory.aspx?DID=11)  
Title: Town Councilor  
Phone: 970 379-2752  
[Email](mailto:Rick.Stevens@basalt.net)

As a long term resident of Basalt, I am passionate about and fully committed to the efforts that create a community where all can thrive. My leadership experience offers a unique combination of business expertise, community service and volunteerism. I was the CEO and President of a locally based company. I have served on Basalt Town Council and the Basalt Planning Commission.  As a community member, I volunteered to lead initiatives that supported early childhood education, attainable housing, and a strong environmental ethos.  I have and will continue to serve our valley in multiple capacities as an advocate for solutions to our shared challenges.

As a leader, I have learned to express care, provide support, grow wisely, expand possibilities, and most importantly share opportunities. Sustaining a community that is diverse, inclusive, and where all can achieve is my ambition. The more we engage with our community the more we all succeed.  

I am an advocate for the formal and informal processes of governance that will create a road map for a future already in motion. Focusing on opportunities for the next generation, while honoring those who came before us, will lead our community to a broader leadership role in the Roaring Fork Valley.  

 Reach out to me by cell or email any time. Thank you for the privilege to perhaps serve our town.

Richard (Rick) Stevens was elected to Town Council in April, 2024 to a four year term that expires April, 2028.
