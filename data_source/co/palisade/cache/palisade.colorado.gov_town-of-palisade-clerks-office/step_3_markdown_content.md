MAYORAL CANDIDATE: Greg Mikolai

**Occupation:** Colorado Mesa University Instructor and Video Producer

**Length of Time as a Town Resident:** 30 Years

**Previous Political Experience:** I served from 2009 until 2017 on the District 51 School Board.  I was President of the board from 2011 through 2013.  I served as a Board of Trustee and Mayor Pro-Tem for the Town of Palisade from 2018 to 2020.  I was elected as Mayor in 2020. 

**Other:** I’ve made Palisade my home for over thirty years after moving here from Minnesota.  My two children, Bridger and Logan, attended Taylor Elementary, Mt. Garfield Middle School, Palisade High School and finally Colorado Mesa University: true products of the Grand Valley’s great educational system.

I’ve worked several positions in the communications industry: KJCT-TV, 3D Systems, Inc. and Rocky Mountain PBS.  I’ve been teaching in the Mass Communication Department of Colorado Mesa University since 2011.

In 2009 I successfully ran for election to represent District E on the District 51 School Board. I served two terms and was president of the board for four years.  That rewarding experience developed the leadership skills and fiduciary accountability I utilize today as Mayor for the Town of Palisade.

MAYORAL CANDIDATE: Bill Carlson

**Occupation:**

**Length of Time as a Town Resident:**

**Previous Political Experience:**

**Other:**

TRUSTEE CANDIDATE: Rick Fox

**Occupation:** Life Safety Manager, Colorado Mesa University

**Length of Time as a Town Resident:** Eighteen years, we purchased our home in early 2006

**Previous Political Experience:** I have no prior elected political experience.

**Other:** I am a Colorado Native from a Western Colorado Pioneer family. My great grandfather came to Telluride from Austria in 1893. Prior to moving to Palisade in 2006, we lived in Delta. I worked for the City of Delta as the Sports Coordinator managing all the active park facilities, youth and adult recreational and competitive sports. Prior to that, I worked for the Colorado Division of Wildlife primarily in support of Whirling Disease research.

I have worked in municipal and state government. I served on the TOP Parks &amp; Recreation Advisory committee for many years and as chair for a few years. I was the President of the Mesa State College Classified Staff Council for many years and served on the Statewide Liaison Council for Higher Ed. I am an active Palisade Lions Club Member and am currently on that Board of Directors. I am a longtime volunteer for La Plaza (formerly Palisade Child and Migrant Services) as well as Palisade Historical Society. I have been a member and active in the Palisade Chamber of Commerce for all the years I've lived here. I have volunteered for all of the Palisade festivals, a volunteer local tour bus driver and have served a special role for Olde Fashioned Christmas for 16 years. I received an award from the TOP for my volunteer service. I was Palisade Lions Club Lion of the Year for 2015. During COVID, I partnered with Palisade COC, Pali-Tours, and Palisade Pedicab to bring Santa Claus to most of the grade schools in the valley via a playground private parade. I was a prime fundraiser and champion for the improved Palisade Skate Park.

I exercise daily over my lunch hour and have for decades. Yoga is my favorite noontime exercise. My wife, Shawna, and I love our golden retriever, Emma. We have historically had a male and female goldie. Our boy, Ray, went to heaven right before Christmas 2023. I collect antique locks and keys. I love to play on the river all summer and XC ski all winter. We are grateful to have lots of family in and around Palisade. We love our simple small town life in Palisade.

I am a regular safety and security consultant for higher ed and K-12 schools. I am not yet appointed to, but regularly participate on the State of Colorado, School Safety Advisory Board. I have organized and presented an annual Western Colorado safety and security training event for more than a decade.

I am looking forward to working on updating the Land Development Code based on the recent Comprehensive Plan and the sewer project to include the reclamation of the Riverbend sewage lagoons. I was on the Palisade Park and Recreation Advisory Board many years ago when we developed the Riverbend Park Conceptual Master Plan looking at some of the possible uses of this park land.

TRUSTEE CANDIDATE: Jeff Snook

**Occupation:** Own &amp; Operate Spoke &amp; Vine Motel as well as Fidel's Cocina &amp; Bar

**Length of Time as a Town Resident:** October will be 6 years

**Previous Political Experience:** Currently on the Tourism Advisory Board (TAB) for the last 3-4 years

**Other:** Hello, my name is Jeff Snook. I’ve lived in Palisade since 2018 when we decided to purchase and renovate a small motel that is now the Spoke and Vine Motel. Our most recent venture has been our restaurant, Fidel’s Cocina &amp; Bar.

Jody and I love living in Palisade and experiencing all that our special town has to offer. The support we’ve received as small business owners has been amazing. As active members in the community, we try to help Palisade thrive the best we can while safeguarding the small-town community feel.   
it is for this reason that I have decided to run for Town Trustee in 2024.

I want to take a collaborative approach to lay out a vision for the future of Palisade. Growth is inevitable and I want our town to grow in a healthy, responsible and sustainable way. And I want all members of our community to thrive and benefit from the growth.

I want to welcome visitors to our town and create experiences for all to enjoy but I want to lay out a framework for respectful and responsible tourism. One that brings revenue and growth but does not diminish our town’s character, well-being and integrity.

I envision infrastructure upgrades, including new streets and sidewalks that keep our children and all of our residents safe.  

I want to continue to seek out programs and grants to improve our town such as new parks, updating our swimming pool, improving our baseball fields and/or outdoor tennis and pickleball courts.

I look forward to meeting with everyone and having forward-thinking and productive conversations about our wonderful community.   
 

TRUSTEE CANDIDATE: Jan Kimbrough Miller

**WITHDREW FROM RACE**

TRUSTEE CANDIDATE: Ellen T Turner

**Occupation:** Retired

**Length of Time as a Town Resident:** 7 Years

**Previous Political Experience:** Current Trustee for Town of Palisade (2020-2024)

**Other:** 

TRUSTEE CANDIDATE: Sarah Matchett

**Occupation:** Professional Cycling Coach

**Length of Time as a Town Resident:** 3.5 years in Palisade

**Previous Political Experience:** None, unless you count my experience negotiating with national governing bodies like USA Cycling and the U.C.I. (Union Cycliste Internationale).

**Other:** I grew up on the corner of my Grandfather’s cattle ranch in Grand Junction on 29 Road and Patterson. Throughout my childhood, I saw the farm shrink and watched housing developments spring up along the edges. Later, when it was time to sell the remaining land (now Matchett Park) we had to confront the competing interests of the town’s desire for growth, my grandfather’s desire to retire with dignity, and the community’s desire to preserve open space. This experience highlighted the complexities of municipal land development and sparked an interest in the politics of urban development.

More recently, I was actively involved in the campaign for the Grand Junction Community Recreation Center. The success of this campaign was the direct result of the vision of my father, and grandfather who were committed to providing access to open space to future generations.

I decided to run for Trustee when I learned that the town will begin revising it’s land use code in 2024. Our land use code is a critical tool for shaping our growth, protecting our character, and promoting the well-being of our residents. It is critical that this revision involves public input and participation and if elected I will work to engage the community in the process. This will ensure that the regulations put in place reflect the values and priorities of those who live here now, fostering a deeper sense of ownership and cooperation within our community.

My family taught me that good neighbors know each other’s names, that playing outside is essential for kids and adults, and that public service is way to build stronger communities. Running and serving in Palisade is a way I can pay homage to these lessons and help ensure that our little corner of the Western Slope continues to be a place where you can get help from a neighbor, where your voice can be heard, and where the growth and prosperity the town enjoys enhances the community for us all.

About Me:  
With a green thumb and a heart dedicated to community, I currently am one of the main members that spearhead the Palisade Community Garden.

Together, we can shape policies that truly reflect the needs and desires of our diverse community.

Events that Unite Us:  
From the success of the Community Garden to the joy of the Clothes Swap, I've witnessed firsthand the transformative power of events that bring us together. As your Trustee, I will continue to champion and create events that celebrate our unique community spirit. Whether it's a seasonal festival, a neighborhood clean-up, or an educational workshop, I envision events that strengthen our bonds and make lasting memories.

Building Bridges, Not Barriers:  
My vision for our community is one of inclusivity, collaboration, and growth. I am dedicated to breaking down barriers and building bridges that connect every corner of our neighborhood. Together, let's create a community where everyone feels not only heard but actively included in the decisions that shape our shared future.
