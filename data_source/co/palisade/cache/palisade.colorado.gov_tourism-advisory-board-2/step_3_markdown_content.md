The Tourism Advisory Board (TAB) is an advisory board made up of volunteer residents and business owners both in and outside of Town.  Once a month, the Tourism Advisory Board meets to work on heightening the Town's exposure among potential visitors, and improving the visitor's experience so that they will keep wanting to come back again and again.  Some of the Board's duties include developing and assessing tourism marketing projects, coordinating past and upcoming events, and making recommendations to the Town Board on decisions affecting Palisade's tourism industry.  

Board members are appointed by the Palisade Board of Trustees to two-year terms.  Each member plays an important role in crafting Palisade's brand as a great cultural and recreational family destination.  The Board has a mix of members from lodging, retail, wine, agriculture, recreation, and at large members which helps ensure that a diversity of interests are represented.

Funding for marketing campaigns comes from a lodging fee that is collected by lodging establishments from Palisade's overnight guests.

*TAB terms are 2 years, with no term limits.*

**If you would like to contact members of the Tourism Advisory Board, please email [info@townofpalisade.org](mailto:info@townofpalisade.org).**
