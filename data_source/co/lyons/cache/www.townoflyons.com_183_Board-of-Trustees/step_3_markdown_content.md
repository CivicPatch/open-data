Suggestions to help make your input more effective

• Public comment is limited to 4 minutes per person and may be shortened to allow all to speak, if at a particular meeting, the Board anticipates extensive public comment.

• Written materials are welcome to be submitted ahead of time, to Town Staff, and will be published in the meeting packet.

• If you provide written materials, please refrain from simply reading that same material to the Board—the Trustees will have already seen it in their packet. Instead, focus on key points and requests you may have for action or information, if applicable.
