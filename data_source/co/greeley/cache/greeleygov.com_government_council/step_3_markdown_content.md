# City Council

![Photo of City Council members, November 2023](https://greeleygov.com/images/default-source/city-council/new-city-council-nov-28-2023.jpg "Nov 28, 2023")

 

The City of Greeley operates with a Council-Manager form of government with the Council acting as the legislative body for the city, adopting laws and policies and setting priorities to guide the city.

Council members are residents of Greeley who care deeply about their city and choose to serve their community as an elected official to maintain and improve Greeley's quality of life. Council members, with the exception of the Mayor, do not have offices at City Hall. There are a total of seven elected council members, including the Mayor.

The Council meets annually to evaluate the state of the City. Based on data, discussions with staff and public input, the Council sets priorities which guide Greeley City government for the upcoming year.

In 2022, the council engaged in a strategic visioning session to develop a vision and direction for Greeley—a city that knows where it came from and where it is going. With a clear picture of who we are and pride in our roots, the [Greeley City Council 2037](https://greeleygov.com/community-vision) vision honors the strength, bountiful resources, diversity and entrepreneurial and creative spirit that is Greeley now and in the future.

In addition to their annual meeting, the Council also meets regularly to conduct City business.
