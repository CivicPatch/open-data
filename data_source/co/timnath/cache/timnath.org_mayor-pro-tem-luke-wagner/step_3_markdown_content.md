Mayor Pro-Tem | Term Expires: April 2026  
[Email Mayor Pro-Tem Wagner](https:lwagner@timnathgov.com)

Mayor Pro-Tem Luke Wagner was born and raised in Fort Collins and is a proud graduate of Fort Collins High School. He holds a bachelor’s degree in international business with a minor in leadership from the University of Denver, where he developed a strong foundation in ethics and leadership. Furthering his education, he pursued a master’s degree in finance at the University of Denver, driven by a passion for finance and accounting. Over the past decade, he has built a successful career in the healthcare industry and has served on several community boards, including the South Timnath Metro District, the Timnath Finance Committee, the Boys and Girls Club, and the Front Range Trauma Counselors. These experiences have equipped him with valuable skills and a deep commitment to public service.

Motivated by a genuine desire to contribute to the well-being of the Timnath community, Wagner decided to run for Town Council to help create a thriving environment for current and future generations. His main objectives during his term include maintaining a healthy capital reserve through prudent financial management, pursuing innovative solutions for non-potable water resources, and implementing efficient water management practices for new developments. Additionally, he is committed to ensuring community safety by advocating for the implementation of round-the-clock operations of the Timnath Police Department. Outside of his council duties, Wagner cherishes spending quality time with his family, coaching his children’s baseball teams, and participating in community events. His dedication to both personal and community well-being underscores his holistic approach to leadership and service.
