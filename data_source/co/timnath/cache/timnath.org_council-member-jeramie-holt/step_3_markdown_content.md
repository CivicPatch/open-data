[Email Council Member Holt](mailto:jholt@timnathgov.com)

Councilmember Jeramie Holt brings a diverse background in business management and risk management to the Timnath Town Council. Growing up in New Jersey, he graduated from West Morris Central High School and studied business management at Rutgers and the County College of Morris. With over 15 years of experience in business and risk management, focusing on business insurance and group benefits, Jeramie has honed his expertise in the nonprofit sector, serving as a board member and president for multiple organizations in northern Colorado. His commitment to community service is further demonstrated by his participation in the first Citizens Academy and his two years on the Town Planning Commission, providing him with a solid foundation for his role on the Town Council.

Motivated by his 12 years as a resident of Timnath, Jeramie Holt is dedicated to ensuring that the voices of the residents are heard and represented. His primary goals include enhancing communication between residents and town officials, bringing much-needed amenities such as a recreational center to Timnath, and focusing on safety in traffic protocols, especially on neighborhood streets and crossings. Jeramie aims to accomplish these objectives by being present and available to residents, engaging in community events, and fostering open discussions. His notable accomplishments include receiving the BizWest magazine 40 Under 40 business professionals award and the Hall of Fame award from Northern Colorado United for Youth. Additionally, through his work with Northern Colorado Youth Hockey, he has helped raise and donate over $5 million to children’s charities in Larimer and Weld counties. Outside of his council duties, Jeramie enjoys spending quality time with his family, golfing, traveling, and watching his sons play competitive hockey and golf.
