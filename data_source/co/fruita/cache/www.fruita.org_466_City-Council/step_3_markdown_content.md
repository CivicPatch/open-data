## ![City Council](https://www.fruita.org/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=2799)Overview

The City of Fruita is a [Home Rule City](https://www.fruita.org/citymanager/faq/what-form-government-structure-city-fruita) with a Council-Manager form of government. The six-member elected City Council makes policy decisions and enacts legislation while a professional City Manager carries out the council's policies and administers the city government. The Mayor is the political head of city government, presiding over City Council meetings, representing the City at public functions and exercising other powers. For additional information on Mayor and City Council terms of office and powers and duties, refer to the [Fruita City Charter](https://www.fruita.org/515/City-Charter).

The Home Rule doctrine allows the City, in matters of purely "local and municipal concern," to adopt ordinances which supersede conflicting state statutes. In matters of "mixed state and local concern" or "state wide" concern, City ordinances must conform to State law. The City Charter sets forth the home rule provisions for the City of Fruita.

The Fruita City Council conducts regular meetings on the first and third Tuesday of each month and holds a workshop on the 4th Tuesday of each month.

Compensation for the Mayor is $525 per month, the Mayor Pro-tem receives $400 per month, and Council members receives $350 per month for their service to the community. Compensation is set by Ordinance and can not be changed during the current term of the Mayor or Council member. The last time compensation for these elected positions was changed was in 2007.

## Duties &amp; Responsibilities

The Council shall have the power to:

- Adopt the budget and determine the city tax levy.
- Adopt ordinances, resolutions, and motions necessary for the orderly conduct of city affairs;
- Review and ratify appointments made by the Mayor;
- Appoint a City Manager and evaluate his performance;
- Enact the necessary legislation required for the operation of the city.

## Civility Proclamation

At the City of Fruita, respect is more than a word; it's part of our core values. We're tough on issues, easy on people. This applies both within our team and with the community we serve. This commitment to respect was strengthened by the Fruita City Council. Fruita City Council recognized the importance of respect by adopting the [City Council's Civility Proclamation (PDF](https://www.fruita.org/DocumentCenter/View/2801). Civility is the steadfast practice of respect, even in disagreement, that fosters constructive dialogue and connection, recognizing the inherent dignity of every person. This proclamation showcases the dedication Fruita City Council has to ensure civility in every interaction, discussion, and decision process.
