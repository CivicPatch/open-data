Rich was born and raised in Utah. He graduated from the University of Utah with a B.A. and M.B.A. He married and brought his family to Grand Junction in 1979 to be the branch manager of a regional wholesale distribution company. Shortly after retiring in 2013, he went to work part-time for CASA of Mesa County where currently he is a part-time volunteer coordinator. He and his wife, Val, have eight children (6 graduates of FMHS and one 12-year-old at FMS) and 13 grandchildren. He and his family have lived in Fruita for the past 11 ½ years.

He has served on the following boards of directors: Crime Stoppers of Mesa County (40 yrs.), CACI Educational Foundation, Family Health West, Western Colorado Horticultural Association and Charisma Chorus. He has served in various leadership positions with Boy Scouts of America, on committees with United Way and Mesa County Valley School District 51 and as a lay leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He has volunteered with the FMHS Booster Club and at Grand Junction Community Food Bank, tutored at Mesa County Library, company advisor at 6 sessions of Colorado Business Week and served on the Mesa County Citizen Review Panel.

Rich loves to live in Fruita as it is a great place to raise children and enjoy wonderful places to exercise, to work, have fun and worship. He would like the opportunity to serve this community on the city council.
