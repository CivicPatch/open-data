Originally from Oakland, CA, James moved to the Grand Valley in 2000. He married Samantha Stockert, a fourth generation Fruita resident in 2001. Together they started Rhema Music &amp; Clothing Co in 2005, and their fitness facility, Fit 4:13, opened in 2014. The older of their two daughters, an FMHS graduate is currently in her second year at Duke University, studying neuroscience &amp; psychology. The younger daughter, a freshman, is on the school Senate at Fruita 8/9, as well as a member of the City of Fruita's Youth Action Council.

James has served two terms on the Fruita Tourism Board and was the annual recipient of Fruita's Arts &amp; Culture Award in 2019. More recently, he served on D51’s Back to School Task Force as a consultant during the pandemic. In addition to being an award winning, critically acclaimed songwriter and touring artist with The Williams Brothers Band, James has thirty years’ experience as a concert promoter, including booking and producing the entertainment for several local events, such as The Fruita Fall Festival, Mike the Headless Chicken Festival, Thursday Night Concert Series, and the Fruita Farmers Market for the past several years.

“The Grand Valley, especially Fruita, has always been so supportive of our family. It is a blessing to live here, raise our family here, and be a part of this wonderful community. It's an honor to be asked by the community to step up and serve in this capacity.”
