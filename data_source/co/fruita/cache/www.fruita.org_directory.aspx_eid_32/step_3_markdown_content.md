Aaron Hancey, a Colorado native, has been a resident of Fruita since 2014 when he was hired by West Star Aviation to serve as the Financial Controller for the Grand Junction, CO and Chattanooga, TN facilities. He currently resides on a small farm with his wife, Lori, and four children who currently attend MRES, Fruita 8/9, and FMHS. Prior to living in Fruita, Aaron worked for a CPA firm in Denver as an auditor and consultant. In 2018 Aaron started his own consulting practice to support growing businesses as a consulting/ part-time Chief Financial Officer. His volunteer activities include serving as a member of the Fruita Planning Commission, an FWorks on-site coordinator, youth leader for his church, BSA leader for 13 years, and missionary service in Norway for two years. Aaron and his family have loved living in Fruita and have enjoyed all that it offers, especially the mountain bike trails, small town feeling, and open sky!

Aaron has a passion for supporting small, locally owned businesses, and his ownership of the Fruita Sno Shack, as well as his professional consulting work with several local businesses give him a unique perspective on the growth and tourism in our community.

Aaron believes that the essence of being an elected representative of our community here in Fruita includes enormous responsibility, high expectations, exceptional performance, un-paralleled integrity, and unwavering trust. Aaron values the community’s voice and aims to magnify all the good Fruita offers, while responsibly contributing to the management of its future growth.
