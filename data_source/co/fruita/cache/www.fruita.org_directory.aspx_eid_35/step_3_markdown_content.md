Hi, my name is Jeannine Purser. Fruita has been home to myself, my husband of 25 years,  and our two amazing daughters for almost 21 years.  I love this town and I can’t imagine living anywhere else.  (Yes, this does sound like a Wheel of Fortune introduction.)

 I have worked at Mesa Valley Community School, a wonderful D51 charter school, since 2012.  My job title at the school is community liaison which entails me working directly with our families, staff and the community at large to bring them all together in a cohesive and meaningful way. In addition to my day job, I have been an integral part of Cavalcade, an all-volunteer Performing Arts Venue in downtown Fruita, for over ten and a half years, and currently serve as Cavalcade’s director. 

I have also been a board member on the Downtown Advisory Board (DAB) since its inception in 2011 and have been the chair of that board for most of that time frame.  Prior to the start of the DAB, I also was a member of several community groups such as Bricks, Homegrown Fruita, and the president of the Shelledy PTO for many years. I have a heart and passion for this town and would be incredibly honored to be elected to serve this community as a Fruita City Councilor.
