Hello! I'm Amanda Quigley, but some of you may remember me from school as Mandy Martin. I had the unique experience of attending Palisade, Central, and Fruita Monument High School back in the 1990's. Since Fruita Monument was the test-school for the trimester model at the time, instead of graduating early I opted to circle back to Palisade to load up on math and science courses for one last semester before graduating with my original class, but my heart has always truly been here in Fruita.

I left Mesa County to seek an education at Colorado Northwestern Community College, where I studied Criminal Justice, and then completed a Bachelor's in Parks and Protected Area Managment at Colorado State University. I spent several years traveling Colorado as a park ranger before returning to Colorado Northwestern Community College as an educator.

I came home to Mesa County to start a career with the Mesa County Sheriff's Office, where I still have the pleasure of serving today. My husband and I purchased a home in Fruita in 2010 to raise our three children, two of which are still at home. I stay active by keeping bees, home brewing, hunting and fishing, walking my white dog all over town, volunteering with public and private entities, and working towards a Paralegal Certification.

I look forward to bringing my educational, professional and life experiences to the Fruita City Council to serve our community to the best of my ability.
