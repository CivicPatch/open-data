My Fruita roots run deep. I am a proud 4th generation Fruitian (Maiden name Snover). I have the unique honor of being able to say I was born in Fruita, in the same Lower Valley Hospital room and delivered by the same doctor as my mother 25 years before me! I met my amazing husband in an FMHS classroom and 26 years later you can still find us decked out in our Fruita blue, cheering our Wildcats to victories in sports, the arts, academics and agriculture. We are thrilled to now have 3 sons who also proudly carry on the Wildcat tradition of excellence.

My life experiences in the Lower Valley have given me several unique perspectives. Having been raised on a local dairy, I understand the important role agriculture has played in Fruita’s history and the valuable contributions it still makes. Working in the elementary classrooms of our school district allowed me to see and hear firsthand the needs and desires of families. Being a small business owner has given me insight into the many unique challenges our local entrepreneurs face. As a Realtor, I also see the needs and desires of our growing population and the importance of personal property rights.

I love the Fruita way of life and hope to be able to serve my community in a way that will allow many future generations the same enjoyment.
