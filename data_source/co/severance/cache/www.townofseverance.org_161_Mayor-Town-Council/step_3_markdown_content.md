# Mayor &amp; Town Council

**Welcome to the "Best, Big, Little Town in the Heart of Northern Colorado!"**

On behalf of the Town Council and all your new neighbors, we’d like to extend a heartfelt welcome to your new home in Severance! We are thrilled you’ve chosen to live, work, and grow in our vibrant community.

**Get to Know Severance**

Although the Town of Severance was incorporated in 1920, we are still very much in our “infancy” regarding commercial development and the availability of in-town business services. Your Town Council is dedicated to economic growth and attracting businesses and services for our citizens. Watch for exciting additions to your shopping options here in Severance in the future.

**Stay Connected with Your Town Council**

As your Mayor, I encourage you to stay engaged with the community and get involved. The Town Council meets on the **2nd and 4th Tuesday of each month**. Our work session begins at **5:00 PM**, followed by our regular meeting at **6:00 PM** at **Town Hall**. We would love to have you join us! If you can't attend in person, feel free to reach out via email. Contact information for each Council member is available right here on our website.

Also, be sure to download our **free Town of Severance app**. It’s your go-to for website access, event updates, meeting notices, and more.

**Looking Ahead**

As Severance continues to grow, we are working hard to bring more businesses and services to the area, enhancing shopping, dining, and local opportunities. We are committed to creating a thriving community that reflects the needs and interests of all our residents.

**We’re Here to Help!**

We are so glad you’ve chosen to be part of our community and look forward to supporting you in making Severance your home. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything or have any questions about settling in.

**We look forward to seeing you around town!**

Matthew Fries
