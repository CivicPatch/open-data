## Members

The Brighton City Council is made up of nine council members. The mayor is elected at-large every four years. The city is divided into four wards. Each ward has two representatives on council. Their terms are for four years and they are staggered. In other words, every two years one ward representative from each ward is up for election.

## Public Involvement

The city council welcomes public comment. To address council regarding items that are not on the current agenda, simply pick up a form at the front desk, complete it and hand it to the city clerk before the city council meeting.

The city clerk sits on the dais and is available for questions before the meeting begins. If you wish to hand out a prepared statement to council, you may give the city clerk copies of the handout to be passed out when it is your turn to speak. Filling out the form ensures that we have the correct name and address of all speakers for the minutes.

When your name is called, proceed to the microphone and clearly state your name and address for the record. If you wish to address council on an item that is on the agenda, wait until that item is discussed and then offer comment when the mayor asks if there is anyone in the audience wishing to speak to council on this matter.
