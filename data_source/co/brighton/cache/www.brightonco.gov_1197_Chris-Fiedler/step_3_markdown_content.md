### About Council Member Fiedler

Dr. Chris Fiedler began serving on City Council in January of 2024.  Chris and his wife, Dr. Jessica Fiedler, and their six children moved to Brighton in July of 2012 when he assumed the role of 27J Schools Superintendent. 

The school district experienced tremendous student enrollment growth, from 16,163 students in the fall of 2012 to 23,108  students in the fall of 2023 - an increase of 43% (nearly 7,000 students) making 27J Schools the fastest growing school district in the Denver metro area during that time frame.  27J Schools is the second largest school district in Adams County and the twelfth largest in Colorado.

Due to the generosity of the voters in Brighton and the other municipalities within 27J Schools, successful bond elections occurred in 2015 and 2021 totaling $764 million to build numerous new schools and renovate and expand existing schools, including three new career and technical education centers at all three comprehensive high schools opening in the fall of 2023.  

Chris also serves on the boards of Adams County Education Consortium and the Community Reach Foundation, is a member of the Rocky Mountain Partnership Executive Committee and is the current President of the Colorado Association of School Executives.
