**WELCOME** TO FOUNTAIN CITY COUNCIL

* * *

The City of Fountain is a full-service municipality. Boards such as City Council, Planning Commission, Park &amp; Recreation, and EDC (Economic Development Committees) are all amenable to the needs of the community. In addition, the boards also help project for the city's future growth.

The city is a Home Rule City governed by a mayor and six council members. The term of office is four years for both Mayor and council members. The City Mayor, at-large council members, and members for the wards in which they live are voters elected. Council elections are non-partisan. The City Manager directs and manages all departments.
