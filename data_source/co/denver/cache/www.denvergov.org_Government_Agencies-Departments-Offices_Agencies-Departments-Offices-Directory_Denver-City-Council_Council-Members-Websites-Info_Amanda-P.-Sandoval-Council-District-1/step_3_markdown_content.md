# Amanda P. Sandoval

## Councilwoman, District 1

![Amanda Sandoval Headshot](https://www.denvergov.org/files/assets/public/v/1/city-council/images/d1/amanda.springphoto.jpeg?dimension=pageimagefullwidth&w=1140 "Amanda Sandoval Headshot")

Denver City Council President Amanda P. Sandoval has proudly served District 1, Northwest Denver, on the City Council since her election in 2019. Born and raised in Denver's Northside, she comes from a family deeply rooted in local politics, which has profoundly shaped her work as a councilwoman. Her father, the late State Senator Paul Sandoval, instilled in her the values of public service through his work as a public servant and as the owner of the beloved restaurant La Casita. Her mother, Mary Helen Sandoval, who led several non-profits and was a prominent advocate for social justice, inspired Amanda's commitment to equity, inclusion, and the importance of community engagement in her work. Together, their legacies guide Amanda's leadership, driving her dedication to serving and uplifting the diverse communities of Northwest Denver.

Prior to her role on the City Council, Councilwoman Sandoval gained valuable experience as a Council Aide to two former Denver City Councilmembers. Her profound commitment to the Northside and public service is reflected in over a decade of dedicated community involvement. Among her many achievements, she has championed the renaming of La Raza Park, facilitated the rezoning of more than 70% of the Northwest Denver, became the first woman to Chair Denver's redistricting process, secured a resounding re-election victory in 2023, and led the successful designation of La Raza Park as Denver’s third Cultural Historic District. 

Councilwoman Sandoval remains steadfast in her dedication to land use, small business development, and the preservation of Northwest Denver's rich history and culture. Her vision is to honor the legacy of past generations while fostering a thriving environment for future generations. 

**District 1 Neighborhoods include:**

### Standing Together for a Unified Denver

On January 13th, 2025, the Denver City Council and the mayor signed proclamations affirming our values and commitments to all of Denver’s residents. While changes and challenges come forward from the federal level, we will not waiver from our support of diverse communities, from seeking equity so that all of our residents may prosper, and ensuring the inclusion and participation of all voices. We are not strangers to hard times, and our enduring spirit is one where neighbors support one another, nonprofits and small business care about our families, and strangers share kindness with strangers. We are representatives of a city we deeply love and we stand shoulder to shoulder with you and all of Denver to ensure we remain a city that faces challenges head on, protects our most vulnerable, and actively contributes to a beautiful city that we can all be proud of for generations to come.
