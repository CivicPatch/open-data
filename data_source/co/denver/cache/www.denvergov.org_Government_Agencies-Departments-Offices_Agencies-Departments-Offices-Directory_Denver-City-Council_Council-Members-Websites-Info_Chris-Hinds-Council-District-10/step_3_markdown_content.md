## About Chris

Chris grew up in rural Texas as the only child of a single mom. He learned the value of hard work watching his mom make ends meet by cleaning houses. Chris was the first in his family to get a scholarship to college. He graduated from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX with a degree in computer science and an MBA in Finance and Strategy. He’s worked in software sales and in financial planning and analysis, including setting and managing the budget of a software company and using financial models to determine which projects to pursue.

On August 26, 2008, Chris’s life changed fundamentally. After photographing the Democratic National Convention, Chris was involved in a motor vehicle crash which paralyzed him from the chest down. In the decade since, Chris has fought for access to transportation for all. He believes that everyone should have access to the things we all need, including housing and transportation, regardless of who you are, where you live, who you love, or your ability or disability.

Chris has fought – and won – on behalf of equitable access at the local, state, and national levels. He has testified in Denver and DC in front of legislative committees, been an invited speaker at seminars, and served as a subject matter expert on transportation, access, and disability topics. In May 2018, Governor Hickenlooper signed the Chris Hinds Act into law. This new law closes loopholes to prevent the fraudulent use of disability parking, and is the result of hundreds of hours of Chris’s research and advocacy.

Chris has dedicated himself to service, and is rolling for City Council on the belief that everyone in Denver deserves access to opportunities – access to housing, transportation, fresh and healthy food, and everything necessary to thrive.
