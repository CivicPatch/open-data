# About Mayor Mike Johnston

![Mayor Mike Johnston stands in front of City and County Building](https://www.denvergov.org/files/assets/public/v/3/mayor/images/mayor_mike_johnston-headshot_ccb.jpg?dimension=pageimage&w=480)

Denver Mayor Mike Johnston was inaugurated as the 46th Mayor of Denver on July 17, 2023. Since the start of his administration, Denver has achieved historic reductions in street homelessness, enhanced public safety, expanded affordable housing, and invested in revitalizing downtown.

Mayor Johnston started his career as a high school English teacher in the Mississippi Delta. He returned home to Colorado to become a school principal, leading three different schools in the Denver metro area. He later served as a senior education advisor to President Obama.

In 2009, Johnston was elected to the Colorado State Senate where he served two terms representing Northeast Denver. During his tenure, he secured bipartisan support to pass Colorado’s version of the DREAM Act, advanced major gun safety legislation, and championed the state’s transition to renewable energy. He later served as the CEO of Gary Community Ventures, a local philanthropic organization, where he built broad, diverse coalitions to pass the state’s first plan for universal preschool and spearheaded efforts to fund affordable housing and homelessness statewide. 

Mayor Johnston grew up in Colorado, speaks Spanish and lives in East Denver with his wife Courtney, who is a Chief Deputy District Attorney, and their three kids.
