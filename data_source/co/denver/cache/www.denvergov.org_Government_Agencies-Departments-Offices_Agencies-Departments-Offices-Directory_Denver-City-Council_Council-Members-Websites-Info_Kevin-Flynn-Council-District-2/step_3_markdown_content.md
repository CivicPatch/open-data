# Kevin Flynn

## Councilman, District 2

![Portrait of Councilman Kevin Flynn in front of a U.S. Flag and the seal of the City and County of Denver](https://www.denvergov.org/files/assets/public/v/1/city-council/images/2019-council-members/flynn_web.jpg?dimension=pageimagefullwidth&w=1140 "Portrait of Councilman Kevin Flynn in front of a U.S. Flag and the seal of the City and County of Denver")

Kevin Flynn is a career journalist who was elected to the Denver City Council in 2015, after nearly three decades of coring the mayor, council and other Denver area stories for the *Rocky Mountain News*. He was re-elected in 2019 and 2023. He is only the fourth person to represent the people of Council District 2 since it was reorganized in 1971, when the council expanded from nine to 11 district seats.

During his tenure on the council, Kevin has focused on elevating the voices of the people of southwest Denver. Since coming into office, he has led the creation of five new Denver Registered Neighborhood Organizations and the expansion of a sixth, to ensure all neighborhoods in the district have official standing when it comes to city business such as rezonings, licenses and major legislative proposals. Kevin’s other focus areas include public safety and policing, and government ethics, having sponsored three separate amendments to bolster the Denver Ethics Code.

A southwest resident since 1981, Kevin came to Colorado from the Philadelphia area, where he was city editor at a daily newspaper in the New Jersey suburbs. At the *Rocky*, he covered everything from the night cops beat to Denver City Hall, from the Bill McNichols administration through that of John Hickenlooper. He was a principal reporter on such major news stories as the 1984 Alan Berg murder and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing case. When the *News* closed in 2009, Kevin spent a year producing his own transportation-oriented online news site before leading the public information team for RTD’s commuter rail project, which built the train to Denver International Airport.

Kevin is married to Harriet Novak and between them they have five children, all of them out on their own, and eight grandchildren. He recently ended a 53-year run as a church choir director, spending the final 13 years at the chapel at Mother Cabrini Shrine on Lookout Mountain. He is also an author of two true-crime books, *The Silent Brotherhood* about the neo-Nazi gang that murdered Berg, and *The Unmasking*, about a fundamentalist Christian woman who discovered her husband was a serial rapist. *The Silent Brotherhood* was made into a major motion picture called *The Order,* starring Jude Law and Nicholas Hoult, which played in theaters in December 2024 and is now on streaming services.
