I am very grateful for the trust I have received from the voters in Durango. I am a Navajo (Diné) born to the To’aheeliini (Water Flows Together Clan) of my mother; my paternal clan is To’dich’ii’nii (Bitter Water Clan). In my large indigenous family, I learned the traditional (Diné) values and I carry the confidence of my Dine values to my role as a Durango City Councilor.

I am a longtime resident of Durango and I attended Fort Lewis College graduating with a Business Administration degree in 1997. My experience at FLC while supporting my family has been a significant accomplishment for me. I have worked with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and other federal, state, and tribal agencies. I also lived in Washington, D.C., where I worked on Capitol Hill on women's rights and racial equality issues. I volunteered with Habitat for Humanity, Durango Historic Preservation Board and La Plata County Undesirable Plants and Rodent Advisory Commission. I am an avid outdoors person. I enjoy skiing, fly fishing, boating, hiking, and lake camping with cooking over a wood fire.

My unique life experience and professional background will be a positive contribution in approaching Durango’s opportunities and challenges. I am particularly interested in issues around affordable housing, homelessness, infrastructure, and parking. I am passionate about preserving historic downtown Durango. I will advocate for our residents, students, and business owners so that their voices are included in the decisions that affect our community.

I am also eager to serve as a role model for our youth. I am committed to engaging them in the decisions that affect their future, especially in protecting our natural resources for future generations. I am dedicated to fostering a welcoming environment that inspires communication and creative problem-solving.

I look forward to working with my colleagues and serving the people of Durango.
