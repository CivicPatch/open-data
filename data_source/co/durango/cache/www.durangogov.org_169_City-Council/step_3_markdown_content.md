## Duties &amp; responsibilities

All City Council members serve the community at large and thus do not represent specific wards or precincts. The mayor is recognized as the head of the city government and presides at all meetings, but has no regular administrative duties and no power of veto. The position of mayor is held by a councilmember for one year and the current members of council vote amongst themselves each April to decide who will hold the mayor and mayor pro tem position. The City Council makes policy and legislative decisions for the City of Durango.

## Meetings

Regular City Council meetings are held on the first and third Tuesdays of every month, beginning at 5:30 p.m. Less formal study sessions are held prior to the regular meetings from 2:15 to 4:45 p.m. The meetings are held in the Smith Council Chambers at City Hall. Because there may be changes in the schedule, please [check the schedule of meetings](https://www.durangogov.org/calendar.aspx?CID=23%2C). Agendas for the meetings are posted on the preceding Fridays.

## How to participate in a City Council meeting

Each regular City Council meeting offers an opportunity for public participation. The Public Participation section of the agenda is set aside for questions or comments by the public regarding items that do not otherwise appear on the agenda. Public participation is not taken during study sessions.

## Public Comment Sign Up For City Council Meetings

Names will be called to speak during the related item on the agenda. Names will not be called if you have signed up after the item has been called to the floor.  [Sign up for public comment here.](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=jOgNBJH4E0emSJuM-DoCdWRdtGQckedCvumTfGdlmepUMlNHNDE0SEc1NkM0ME1BSFFaMVBVVEZHMC4u&origin=lprLink)

## Public Comment Rules For City Council Meetings

1. Begin your comments by stating your full name and if you are a resident of the City of Durango. If you are not a resident, please state what connection you have to the agenda item.
2. Make your comments directly to the council. Do not expect a response from the council or staff. Council or staff may reference your comments during council discussion of the item.
3. Public comments are limited to 3 minutes for each individual signed in unless modified by the council, and unused time is not transferable to other speakers.
4. Comments must be germane and specific to the agenda item or on a city-related matter. Matters of international political controversy, ideological or religious beliefs, or individual conviction are outside the scope of this forum. Personal attacks, profanity, hate speech, derogatory remarks, speech unrelated to the agenda item, or other speech that is disruptive to the meeting will be ruled out of order by the chair, and any remaining time will be forfeited by the speaker.
5. Exceeding the time limit infringes on the rights of others and is out of order. Only a majority vote of the council can modify time limits.

Note: These rules are subject to modification by the Chair and Council at any time to accommodate a fair and professional business meeting of the Council, where all members of the community who wish to speak are given a fair opportunity to do so.  Any changes will be announced at the time of public comment.

Regular City Council meetings are televised live on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/CityofDurangoYoutube), and on the city's [website](https://durangogov.hylandcloud.com/221agendaonline) (click on "Live Media").
