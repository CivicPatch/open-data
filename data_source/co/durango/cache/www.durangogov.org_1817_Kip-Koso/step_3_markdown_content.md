I had the good luck to grow up in Durango. I am one of two sons of a single mother who wanted her boys to grow up in the Colorado mountains. Following high school, I moved away for college (Humboldt State University), graduate school (Penn State) and to find my wife, Jeanine! When we began our family, we made our way back to Colorado. We have a son and daughter who are fully launched adults at this point and a dog (Nyx!) who is most definitely not fully launched… My education and career have been focused on health and wellness both at an individual level and at the broader community level. I have experience in working for small, mom and pop businesses as well as overseeing large operating budgets and groups of employees in different regions of the U.S and Canada.  I am by nature a consensus builder that truly enjoys finding a compromise solution so that individuals with differing opinions can all move forward in a business, on a special project or to solve a critical issue.  

I have always believed in giving back to my community. I was a co-founder of two Boys and Girls Clubs, for La Plata County and the Southern Ute Indian Tribe. These were multi-year projects that required pushing through governmental bureaucracies, building consensus and working thru objections. All while organizing our group of volunteers and seeking multiple budget sources to help kids experience positive adult role models while engaging in quality after-school programs. I have a robust connection to the local non-profit community and the invaluable work they do to support our community. My current positions as Board Chair for Big Brothers Big Sisters and Local First speaks to my passion for supporting our community kids and our small, independent businesses that form the heart (and financial center) of our community. Other non-profits I have worked with over the years include La Plata Economic Development Action Partnership (LEAD), Leadership La Plata Steering, Recruitment and Retreat committees, Cowboy Social organizing committee, Taste of Durango, Iron Horse, Noel Night, Harvest dinner and many more. I wanted to become a city councilor so I can continue to give back through a leadership role in the city, put my experience to work for our community and to build stronger relationships with our neighbors in La Plata County and the Southern Ute Indian Tribe.

Outside of work, I am one of those oddballs that works out at 4 a.m. many mornings at the gym or you may see me hiking or snow shoeing super-early in Horse Gulch, which is one of my favorite places in the world.
