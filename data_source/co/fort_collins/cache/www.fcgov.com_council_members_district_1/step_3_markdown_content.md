## Councilmember Susan Gutowsky, District 1

![Councilmember ](https://www.fcgov.com/council/img/gutowsky-2023-photo-for-web.jpg)

**City Mailing Address:** P.O. Box 580, Fort Collins, CO, 80522  
**Work/Office:** 970-221-6878  
**E-mail:** [sgutowsky@fcgov.com](mailto:sgutowsky@fcgov.com)

[Biography](https://www.fcgov.com/council/members/?district=1%2F)

Susan Gutowsky was first appointed on January 15, 2019 and then elected in April 2019 to represent the residents of District 1, where she has resided since moving to Fort Collins almost 40 years ago. She was re-elected in 2021.  Susan speaks with great love for the vibrancy, diversity and rich culture in District 1.

Susan and her husband, Wayne, have raised two children in Fort Collins. Both attended Poudre School District schools—Riffenburgh, Lesher and Fort Collins High School—and have enjoyed very satisfying careers. They also have two grown grandchildren and a great grand-daughter. The family is proud to call Fort Collins their home.

Susan earned her undergraduate degree from the University of California, Irvine, including a year of study in Spain at the University of Madrid. She proudly holds a master’s degree from Colorado State University and is a lifetime member of the alumni association and an enthusiastic supporter of the Rams! She enjoyed a 34-year career as a classroom teacher—26 of those years teaching middle school in the Poudre School District. Since retiring, she served two consecutive terms as a Director on the Poudre School District Board of Education before joining City Council.

Over the years, Susan has kept herself busy serving in various volunteer capacities.  She was on the Project Smile Board for several years and especially enjoyed volunteering at Poudre School District schools’ dental/vision screenings.  She has also dedicated her time to the Larimer Humane Society, working with community outreach and fundraising.  She has worked as a judge for the Larimer County Election Centers for the past 10 years.  The most exciting thing about this experience is watching young people and first-time voters exercise their civic right to cast their ballots.

She currently serves on the executive board of the Museo de Las Tres Colonias. The mission of the Museo is to interpret the early history of the sugar beet industry in Fort Collins and celebrate the rich Hispanic culture in our community.

In her role as a Councilmember, Susan is part of the Senior Advisory Board where she is focused on the needs of the senior community, a population that can sometimes be considered invisible.  She also serves on the Downtown Development Authority Board, helping to steward the care of one of Fort Collins’ beloved destinations in the heart of Fort Collins.  She also currently serves on the Poudre Fire Authority Board and the Historic Preservation Commission.  The kaleidoscope of how she engages with different groups reflects many of Susan’s passions and her desire to serve all facets of our community.

Those who work with Susan see her willingness to tackle complex issues, her deep intention to listen to others, and asking questions to understand all sides of an issue as City Council tackles a myriad of important decisions.

When Susan has free time, she enjoys a good workout at the club or reading in the shade of one of Fort Collins’ beautiful parks. Time with family is also a vital part of her life and she cherishes two special traditions. Every year she and her husband, Wayne, travel to Jackson, Wyoming for her annual birthday whitewater rafting trip down the Snake River. The other is their family trips to Chicago. Ever the avid Rockies fan, Susan indulges her family in their support of the Cubbies while wearing her purple and white pin-striped jersey!
