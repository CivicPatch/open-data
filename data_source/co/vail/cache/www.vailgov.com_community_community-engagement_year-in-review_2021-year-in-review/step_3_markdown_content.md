2021 Town of Vail Year in Review

  **2021 Year in Review**](https://www.vailgov.com/home/showdocument?id=2739&t=637822426674503029)

Ground breakings, ribbon cuttings, new initiatives and an election highlighted the year in 2021 as the town transitioned to varying degrees of state and county public health orders as the community worked to help keep Vail safe and open for the winter season while grappling with the personal impacts of living with COVID-19. Vail’s economic resiliency continued to exceed expectations as the town welcomed back the GoPro Mountain Games and other special events throughout the summer and fall as restrictions were rolled back to a more typical format. Together, these efforts helped stimulate record sales tax collections for much of the year.

Celebrations recognized significant community milestones with the opening of the new $3 million Children’s Garden of Learning facility which made way for ground to be broken to build homes for as many as 200 year-round and seasonal residents with construction of The Residences at Main Vail. A public financing model was used to leverage record low interest rates for the housing development with construction to be completed in summer 2023.

Voters turned out in record numbers for the November coordinated Municipal Election to seat four Town Council members and approve a half-cent sales tax increase that provides a permanent funding source for housing for the next 30 years. During the leadership transition, Kim Langmaid became only the second woman in Vail’s history to become mayor, while Dave Chapin was recognized for finishing out his third term as mayor.

Vail’s legacy of environmental sustainability and innovation took hold with introduction of a pilot program to improve loading and delivery operations in Vail Village through use of electric carts and underground delivery bays. The community also welcomed its first electric buses on the way to transitioning to a clean energy fleet by the year 2032.

Looking to the future, adoption of the West Vail Master Plan set in motion a series of actions that will be used to retain and expand housing opportunities for full-time residents and improvements to the commercial core area as well as transportation and mobility functions. Plans to reactivate implementation of the Civic Area Plan were approved as the town set out to solicit partnership ideas from development partners to redevelop town-owned properties in the heart of Vail.

As the year was coming to an end, a spike in local COVID-19 cases caused Eagle County to impose an indoor mask mandate just as the community was preparing to offer its best holiday experience possible. “Be kind and be patient” was the message of the day as guests and locals experienced the many challenges associated with the impacts of COVID-19.

Examples of these and other activities attributed to the Town Council, staff and members of the community are detailed below:

The first Vail businesses to earn the State of Colorado’s “5 Star” Certified Business Program were announced: Grand Hyatt, Ritz Carlton Residences, Vail Marriott and Tavern on the Square. Certified businesses were eligible for less restrictive capacity limits that accelerated their reopening by allowing them to operate at a less restricted blue phase than the county’s yellow phase.

**March 31 – Grant Award Program (GAP) Application Deadline**  
Vail businesses were reminded of the application deadline to apply for GAP funding. By mid-March, $266,250 had been awarded to 24 Vail businesses experiencing hardship due to the public health crisis.

**April 6 – Outdoor Ambience Refinements**  
Building on the success of temporary adaptations made to keep businesses thriving during the pandemic, two ordinances were approved by Town Council that provided additional allowances for outdoor alcohol consumption year-round and outdoor entertainment enhancements. The ordinances created the ability to form Entertainment Districts in Vail Village and Lionshead and amended the amplified sound regulations between the hours of 2 and 8 p.m.

**April 18 – Vail Mountain Closes**  
Vail Resorts succeeded in maintaining public health protocols to meet its goal to keep the mountain open for the entire 2020-2021 season.

**April 20 – Outdoor Mask Mandate Rescinded**  
Vail’s outdoor mask mandate, which had been in place since Nov. 7, 2020, was rescinded by the Town Council, noting that nearly 80% of Eagle County’s at-risk population had been vaccinated and upon accomplishing the goal to deliver a successful ski season from start to finish. The town indicated it would rely on the county’s public health orders moving forward, which had been less restrictive.

**May 19 – Eagle County Lifts Public Health Orders**  
With disease incidence showing a steady decline and vaccination rates on the rise, Eagle County Public Health and Environment lifted all local public health orders related to COVID-19, more than a week earlier than expected. Residents and guests were reminded that the county was still subject to any statewide and federal public health regulations in place, including mask requirements in some circumstances.

**May 19 – Use of Face Coverings in Town of Vail Public Buildings**  
Protocols for access to Town of Vail public buildings were announced that allowed members of the public and employees who are fully vaccinated to access town buildings without a face covering. For those who were not fully vaccinated, it was recommended that face coverings be worn and physical distancing be maintained while interacting with others.

**June 1 – Town of Vail Facilities, Operations Return to Pre-Pandemic Services**  
Following the lifting of Eagle County public health orders, town offices and facilities returned to in-person services. Members of the public were also given the option to continue to do business over the phone or online.

**June 5 – Vail Summer Events Calendar is Full**  
The town began promoting a full events calendar with the return of local programming and activities, offering an ambitious scenario from that of a year ago.

**June 9 – Alcohol Consumption Areas Modified**  
With COVID-19 restrictions lifted and restaurants and bars allowed to operate at full capacity, the Town Clerk’s Office began notifying licensed establishments of immediate changes to the sale and consumption of alcohol to comply with recently passed state laws. This included discontinuation of outdoor common consumption zones and floating outdoor bars. Takeout delivery of alcohol was allowed to continue per state law and temporary modified patio approvals were extended by the town.

**Aug. 13 – Protocols for Eagle County Schools**  
Eagle County Public Health and Environment issued a Public Health Order requiring masks for students, staff, and visitors while indoors at schools where there are large numbers of youth that are not yet eligible for a vaccination against COVID-19 (e.g. k-5, k-8 or k-12). In schools with only youth that are eligible for vaccination (e.g. 9-12 grade), masks remained as a recommendation given the high rates of vaccination among those age groups.  

**Aug. 23 – Face Coverings Required in Public Buildings**  
Following a recent surge of Delta variant COVID-19 cases in the area and nationwide, along with epidemiological evidence that shows that unvaccinated individuals fuel increased rates of community transmission, the town manager issued an emergency order requiring all patrons to wear face coverings when accessing public buildings regardless of vaccination status. The requirement, which applied to the Municipal Complex, Vail Public Library, Welcome Centers, Fire stations, transit centers and Public Works Shops, remained in effect for the remainder of the year.

**Sept. 1 – Vail Public Library Hours Restored**  
Vail Public Library resumed pre-COVID hours, thus bringing back 12 hours of service per week to the community which included an earlier opening 4 days per week as well as 4 evenings per week.

**Sept. 1 – Ford Amphitheater Protocols**  
Proof of vaccination along with a photo ID was required for all attendees 12 and older, and masks required for children ages 2-11, at Gerald R. Ford Amphitheater.

**Sept. 20 – Vail Resorts Winter Operating Plan**  
Protocols for the 2021-2022 ski and ride season were announced by Vail Resorts which centered on its commitment to safety and the guest experience. While there would be no reservation system, masks would be required in indoor settings and proof of vaccination and reservations would be required for dining. In addition, all Vail Resorts employees would be required to be vaccinated. 

**Dec. 17 – Public Health Advisory**  
Eagle County Public Health and Environment issued a public health advisory in response to a sharp increase in the number of new COVID-19 cases. Local testing was quickly reaching its capacity and persons with symptoms were being prioritized for testing.

**Dec. 21 – Town Employees Return to Remote Work**  
A rapid increase in the COVID-19 positivity rate caused the town to adjust its day-to-day operations by returning to a mix of remote work and limited staffing for in-person services. Community members were asked to conduct business with the town via phone and/or online services as available through the holidays.

**Dec. 22 – Countywide Indoor Mask Mandate**  
A countywide indoor mask mandate was reinstated by Eagle County Board of Health in response to alarming news about the rise of COVID-19 cases in the community. The mandate applied to all public indoor spaces, such a public facilities, businesses and other common spaces. The mandate was set to expire on Jan. 17, 2022, and was to be reevaluated at that time.

**Dec. 31 – Coronavirus Pandemic Federal Grant Awards**  
Through the Coronavirus Response &amp; Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSAA) of 2021, the federal government provided support to the transit industry during the public health emergency. The town was awarded a total of $1.8 million in 2021 from these federal funds.  Separately, the town received $450,000 in federal funding as a continuation of the CARES Transit Act funding and $1.4 million in America Rescue Plan (ARP) funds. The ARP funds are focused on public health impacts from the pandemic and have not been spent by the town, with future funding decisions coming in 2022.  

Community Leadership, Outreach &amp; Initiatives

****Election Results Nov. 2****

- **Town Council**  
  From a field of 10 candidates, voters re-elected an incumbent and seated three newcomers to the Vail Town Council during the November election. Pete Seibert, Jr., was the top vote getter in his second attempt to win election. Voters also seated incumbent Travis Coggin and elected two new members, Barry Davis and Jonathan Staufer. Davis, too, had made an unsuccessful bid for council two years earlier, while this was the first election for Staufer. As the top three finishers, Seibert, Coggin and Davis were elected to four-year terms, while Staufer will serve two years. Incumbent Brian Stockmar narrowly missed reelection, finishing fifth.
- **New Mayor, Mayor Pro Tem**
  
  Kim Langmaid was appointed mayor and Travis Coggin was selected mayor pro tem during the Town Council’s organizational meeting in December. Each will serve two years. Langmaid had served as mayor pro tem for the previous two years and became the second woman in Vail’s history to become mayor.**Ballot Issue 2A** Voters said yes to Ballot Issue 2A which authorizes an increase of 0.5% in the town’s existing sales tax, other than on food for home consumption, to fund housing initiatives, housing developments and housing programs. The vote was 771 “yes” versus 685 “no.” The 53% margin of approval nearly mirrored a community opinion survey fielded by election consultants Magellan Strategies in July.
- **Voter Turnout**  
  Coordinating Vail’s Nov. 2 election with Eagle County for the second year in a row helped generate a record turnout for an off-year election with more than 40% of registered voters taking part in which 1,814 ballots were cast.

 The Residences at Main Vail

- **Development Agreement with Triumph Development, Inc.**  
  Negotiations continued throughout much of the year between the Town Council and Triumph Development to structure agreements resulting in design, development review, construction and future operation of The Residences at Main Vail, a 72-unit deed-restricted housing development on town-owned land, which broke ground in November. In February, the town manager addressed the community and explained the development had previously been included in the town’s “Alternative Housing Sites Initiative” which was intended to protect and preserve the Booth Heights parcel in East Vail from future development, but that scenario was now no longer the case. Contrary to public opinion, he stated the town was incapable of causing Vail Resorts to prohibit future development on the Booth Heights parcel. Instead, he said the town was acting in good faith to facilitate a housing development on town property to help deliver much-needed rental homes to the community as soon as possible.
- **Town-Initiated Financing**  
  With record low interest rates and the ability to retain ownership of the property in perpetuity, the Town Council shifted its focus in June to an alternative agreement with Triumph Development. Earlier negotiations had required Triumph to fund the construction, own the improvements and operate the rental housing development. However, opportunities to place the town in a controlling position were identified in which the town could retain annual rental income from the development to cover annual debt payments from town-initiated financing. In this scenario, which was ultimately approved by Town Council, the role of Triumph Development shifted from a leasehold interest developer that owns and operates the improvements on the property to a fee-based developer with a property manager role upon execution of a management agreement. Approvals were given in September to hire a bond underwriter to facilitate the sale of $25 million tax-exempt certificates of participation for the housing development with a payback over 30 years. The bonds were sold Oct. 20 with an upgraded bond rating of Aaa, allowing the town to receive the best interest rate on the financing at 2.7%.

West Vail Master Plan

Town Council adopted the much-anticipated West Vail Master Plan in October and directed staff to begin implementing the first phase of recommendations. The long-range planning process was initiated in the spring of 2020 and provides a cohesive vision for: improvements to the commercial core area, retaining and expanding housing opportunities for full-time residents, and improvements to transportation and mobility functions. Completion of the plan had been identified as a high priority by the Town Council. 

****Destination Stewardship Plan****

In November the town issued a Request for Proposal from qualified firms to develop a Destination Stewardship Plan to guide Vail’s management of the tourism economy within the local community. A contract for services was to be completed by the end of the year.

**Civic Area Plan**

During an update in December, Town Council authorized staff to move forward with a request for qualifications process to discover the types of ideas and expertise a development team can offer the town for a possible public-private venture. The plan contains development, redevelopment and enhancement concepts for the Charter bus lot and Dobson Ice Arena, Municipal Building site, Lionshead parking structure, Lot 10 and Vail Public Library. Implementation had been on hold due to pandemic impacts. However, in recent months the town had been approached by potential developers interested in partnering with the town. Work would also be taking place to pursue an engineering and architectural analysis of Dobson Ice Area to determine its useful life.  

****New Battery Electric Buses****

The town embarked on a new era in its zero-emissions goals with introduction of its first-ever battery electric buses in April. In all, four e-buses were added to the Vail Transit fleet during the year, representing a major milestone in Vail’s goal to transition 100% of its 33 buses to a clean energy fleet by the year 2032. Transitioning to electric vehicles is one of the most effective ways to achieve a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and 80% by 2050 when paired with other emission reduction strategies.

### **East Vail Trails Initiative**

In June the town joined with the U.S. Forest Service to implement parking restrictions at trailheads in East Vail to address overcrowding and neighborhood safety concerns such as speeding and parking violations. This included a summerlong closure of the parking area for the Booth Lake Trailhead and changes to parking areas for the Gore/Deluge trailhead to address conflicts between vehicles and bicyclists on Vail Pass. A campaign to encourage Booth Lake trail users to use the free transit system to “Bus it to Hike It” doubled ridership from the previous year. Trailhead parking at Booth Lake was reopened in October with recommended programming for the summer 2022 hiking season and additional long-term recommendations forthcoming.

Short-term Rentals

In July the Town Council considered an emergency ordinance to suspend new registrations for certain short-term rentals to take a brief “time out” to study the impacts of short-term rentals in Vail, especially in residential neighborhoods and the impact of available housing for local residents. Rather than enact a suspension, the Council agreed to allow results of the study to help direct future actions. The study was authorized in August and was to be completed by early 2022. At the close of the year, there were 2,454 approved short-term rental registrations in Vail. Of those, 1,299 registrations had no front desk and are not fractional units.  

### **Dismount Zone in Vail Village**

In September the Town Council formally adopted a dismount zone in designated areas of Vail Village to improve interactions between pedestrians and cyclists. The zone, which remained in place through the fall, included all of Bridge Street from the Covered Bridge to Seibert Circle and on Gore Creek Drive from Checkpoint Charlie to the edge of the pedestrian zone east of Gorsuch Ltd. Signs were placed reminding people to “Walk Your Wheels.” ****E-Vail Courier Pilot Program****  
A pilot program to improve loading and delivery operations in Vail Village began in November to coincide with the 2021-2022 ski season. Facilitated by the Vail Police Department, local logistics company 106West and Vail Resorts, the E-Vail Courier program works with select purveyors to provide door-to-door deliveries to businesses using small electric carts in place of large delivery trucks. Participating trucks are being directed to underground loading docks to reduce idling and improve the visual aesthetics and overall guest experience in the Village. Deliveries take place from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Friday on Bridge Street and Gore Creek Drive.

International Police Leadership

Police Chief Dwight Henninger was sworn-in as president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police during a ceremony in Alexandria, Va., in September. First elected to the IACP executive board in 2017, Chief Henninger will serve as president until October 2022. He remains as chief in Vail while heading up the 31,000-member organization with representation from 168 countries.

Regional Transportation Authority

In September Town Council approved an agreement with the county’s other governmental entities to begin the process to establish a regional transportation authority. The agreement allows for creation of various advisory groups, including a Formation Committee, Technical Advisory Committee and a Community Stakeholder Committee in advance of a November 2022 ballot initiative to formally establish a Regional Transportation Authority for Eagle County.

Annual Community Meeting

The town hosted its 2021 Community Meeting in a fast-paced virtual format on March 30 to comply with public health protocols around public gatherings. It had been a year ago on March 10 when the 2020 Community Meeting became Vail’s first casualty of the pandemic as the meeting abruptly shifted to an online format as more information was becoming known about the spread of COVID-19. The 2021 meeting included pre-recorded video vignettes and interviews showcasing how the community came together in extraordinary ways to keep Vail safe and open. The meeting was aired on Facebook Live as well as on High Five Public Access Media’s Live on Five and encouraged viewers to comment with an observation or something they learned during the presentation for the chance to win a Blue Parking Pass. The livestream on Facebook led to nearly 2,000 impressions and 586 likes, comments and shares.

   
Trailblazer Award

Sally and Bill Hanlon were recognized as recipients of the 2021 Vail Trailblazer Award. The Hanlons have spent more than 50 years serving as Vail’s ambassadors in welcoming guests and new community members to town while successfully operating numerous businesses and contributing their time and talent to various civic endeavors. Presented by the Vail Town Council, the annual award honors those who have contributed their time and talent to make Vail a great community.

### **PrimaVail**

The community-inspired guest experience initiative that was launched at the start of the 2019-2020 winter season continued in 2021 with safety-focused winter and summer programming to include online guest experience training, walking tours and employee recognition. Produced by the town in cooperation with Vail Mountain and the Vail Chamber &amp; Business Association, the free PrimaVail and PrimaService programming is designed to not only educate employees on the importance of premier hospitality, but also to create a sense of community among its participants who work in Vail. More than 760 participants from 100 businesses were enrolled during the winter 2020-2021 season while 160 participants from 60 business took part during summer 2021.  
****Social Media****  
The town placed a higher priority on leveraging social media communications in 2020, which continued into 2021. The Communications, Police, Fire, Library and Environmental teams use their presence on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to share their messages, celebrate the community as well as receive public input. These channels have become an especially important avenue for communicating with the 25- to 44-year-old demographic.   
****Vail Social****  
The Vail Social community potluck returned in September for its second year, providing a community-building outlet for more than 600 attendees with tables spanning across the International Bridge in Vail Village. The picnic had been postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic. Sponsored by the Town Council, the event celebrates community friendships and comradery.

Grant Relief Program (GAP)

The town’s Grant Relief Program provided direct aid to qualifying businesses experiencing hardship due to the public health crisis. Authorized by a $500,000 allocation from Town Council, GAP applications ranging from $5,000 to $15,000 per business were collected from Feb. 2 to March 31. In all, 39 businesses received grants averaging $11,300 per business. Funding was distributed across a variety of business types including lodging, food and beverage, service and retail.

### **2022 Budget Approved**

Town Council adopted an $81.2 million expenditure plan for 2022 municipal services in October. Priorities that guided the 2022 conservative budget tie directly to themes found in both the Council Action Plan and community survey results. This includes ensuring citizens are afforded the opportunity to live and thrive in the community, providing a world-class guest experience, balancing Vail’s economic, environmental and social needs to deliver a sustainable community, as well as growing a vibrant and diverse economy. The budget also includes initiatives and programs to improve employee recruitment and retention to align with a philosophy of premium pay for premium services. The operational budget for 2022 municipal services represents an increase of 10% from the 2021 amended budget with sales tax, the largest single revenue source, estimated to be 2.2% less than 2021 projections. Major capital improvements include completion of The Residences at Main Vail rental housing development, a fire truck replacement, oversize vehicle parking area and solar panels at the Ford Park amphitheater. Debt service payments of $2.4 million were budgeted for the financing of two projects in 2022: the Public Works Shops project lease purchase agreement which was financed with a $15.2 million loan over a 15-year term at an interest rate of 1.76% annually and $1.16 million of debt service payments as well as $25 million, 30-year certificates of participation for construction of The Residences at Main Vail with a debt service payment of $1.2 million. Reserve funds were projected to be $90.6 million at the end of 2022.

Cultural Heritage Committee and Programs

A Cultural Heritage Committee was established in April with support from Town Council. The group includes representation from town departments and the Colorado Snowsports Museum and Hall of Fame for the purpose of reviewing programs that preserve, enrich and sustain the cultural and historical legacy of Vail to further the community’s sustainable destination certification status. Notable projects during the year included support of the 50th anniversary of the Summervail Art Workshop and continuation of the Vail Trail digitization project and the Vail Valley Voices oral history work. 

 

Economy

### Economic Recovery

Economic recovery efforts initiated during the second quarter of 2020 continued in 2021, including working one-on-one with event promoters to help provide guidance on public health protocols for indoor and outdoor events. Other measures that continued into 2021 included expanded outdoor spaces for storefronts, restaurants and bars. Staff also continued to collaborate with regional and county planning efforts to optimize the exchange of information.

****Town Revenues****  
Estimated 2021 sales tax collections of $31.4 million, a vital indicator of the town’s economy, generated 25% more revenue than in 2020 (6.4% more than 2019), exceeding COVID-adjusted forecasts, including record collections from March through October (November/December not reported as of publication). Year-to-date Real Estate Transfer Tax collections of $11.8 million through November were pacing up 33% from the prior year and up 86% from 2019. 

### Special Events

While there was still a lot of uncertainty in the world about COVID-19, gatherings, and a return to normal, the state of Colorado, Eagle County Public Health and the Town of Vail welcomed back many of the town’s special events in a more typical format.

Early 2021 saw the continuation of many of the town’s COVID-inspired village enhancements including ambient music and entertainment. Due to the ongoing public health crisis, several April events were canceled or postponed until later in the year, most notably Taste of Vail and Powabunga. As case counts decreased and vaccination rates increased, Vail’s event producers quickly ramped up their planning for a return of summer events. Visitors and residents alike welcomed back the GoPro Mountain Games, which kicked off summer with one of the first large scale events in the region June 10-13. Following the successful execution of the Mountain Games, most summer and fall events returned, with some still implementing COVID protocols.  The return of special events during the summer was embraced and celebrated, with record turn out and positive guest satisfaction scores.

Looking to provide additional events during the early winter season, the town provided funding to bring back Vail Snow Days and provide additional funding for enhanced talent for Powabunga Vail. Revely Vail and Vail Holidays also returned with a full schedule of music, art and village activities to surprise and delight children and adults alike from mid-November through the end of December.    

****Vail Local Marketing District****

The Vail Local Marketing District continued a shift in strategy during the year to focus on building an owned database to more actively engage known guests. With the continual presence of Vail’s online home at DiscoverVail.com, the need for year-round marketing efforts arose and the VLMD responded with seasonally appropriate, engaging content. The website is in its second year, providing robust and compelling content to feature the best of Vail, and includes information on shops, restaurants, activities and a comprehensive lodging search engine that allows users to book their reservations online directly with Vail properties. A robust year-round content plan was created to improve and enhance guest communication, and the number of database records doubled in size. The goal of the data collection is to enable the VLMD to create a long-term relationship with Vail’s guests, including providing post visit surveys to better understand the guest experience. As of mid-December, VLMD lodging tax revenue totaled $2.4 million, down 16.8% from 2019 but up from the amended crisis budget. Expenses were $2 million compared to the amended budget of $2.6 million. 

In an effort to jump start the Destination Stewardship Plan that is being created in 2022, the VLMD created a sustainability campaign focusing on the Seven Principles of Leave no Trace and Care for Colorado content to continue to educate guests and the community on how to protect Vail and the mountains, streams and wildlife that surround it. A sustainability quiz was created to engage guests and educate them on Vail’s values including the protection and preservation of our natural environment. 

### New Businesses

Thirty-three new business licenses were issued by the town in 2021, including 10 new retail establishments, 15 new lodging/property management businesses, 3 new food and beverage licenses, and 5 in the “other” category. Licenses were forfeited by 19 businesses.

### Short-Term Rentals

The fourth year of the town’s short-term rental regulations saw an increase in compliance. The estimated compliance rate of 95% for the year includes 2,454 registered properties in Vail. Twenty-five fines were issued in 2021. 

### **2020 Audit**

Results of an independent audit of town financials for 2020 showed the town continuing its strong financial position. For the full-year, government-wide revenue exceeded expenses by $17.5 million. Total reserves at the end of 2020 were at $116.6 million; of that, $90.4 million was available for general operations and capital spending. The remainder is restricted by use, such as the town’s minimum reserve requirement of 35% annual revenues, as well as reserves in restricted funds such as Dispatch Services, Health Insurance Fund and Heavy Equipment Fund. 

2020 Census

Results of the 2020 (Decennial) Census were released in August. Vail’s resident population count was 4,835, which is an 8.9% decrease from the 2010 Census count. The United States Census is a constitutionally mandated count of every person living in the U.S. that occurs every ten years.  [Link to Town of Vail Census results](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/all?q=Vail%20town%2C%20Colorado)

### Welcome Centers

As the town adapted to COVID-19 restrictions and mandates, the Welcome Centers continued with the Guest Service Advocate program and the addition of Transit Hosts to assist with capacity limits and in-town bus route modifications during the winter. In the spring the Welcome Centers collected updates on operating hours from business and restaurants to help guests with easy access to shopping and dining. Summer was extremely busy and included the return of the Community Host program and the Trail Host program. In its third year, the Trail Host program was especially helpful with the Booth Lake trailhead parking lot closure. For the 2021-2022 winter season, an expansion of the PrimaVail guest service training was introduced by the Welcome Centers to assist businesses with basic guest service skills and Vail updates. As the year was coming to a close, the Welcome Centers were recording record visitation. 

REDEVELOPMENT/BUILDING ACTIVITY

An ordinance requiring contractors to be certified and/or licensed within their trade became law on May 1, 2021 (Ordinance 12, Series 2020). While contractors had been required to register with the town for decades, they had not had to provide any proof of qualification or competency.

****Major Projects Completed****

- **Altus Vail/Mountain View**  
  In the fall, Altus Vail, formerly Mountain View, was completed after three years of construction. The five-story development features 15 residential units plus 20 attached accommodation units (lock-offs) and 15 deed-restricted employee housing units.
- **The Hythe**  
  A $40 million renovation of the former Vail Marriott in Lionshead was introduced as The Hythe in November. The new Luxury Collection Resort from Marriott International features a remodeled lobby, four new cuisine and beverage concepts, redesigned outdoor area and 344 renovated rooms.

****New Projects****

- **Marriott Residence Inn**  
  In May site work began at the former site of the Roost Lodge as the new Marriott Residence Inn broke ground. The development includes a new 4-story hotel with underground parking, plus 146 Limited-Service Lodge Units and onsite dormitory-style employee housing for 9 employees composed of 5 bedrooms. Estimated completion is May 2023.
- **Vail Health Interior Renovations**  
  A phased approach to renovation of several areas within the hospital was initiated. These renovations are comprised of the first floor including the lobby and corridor, renovation of the Intensive Care Unit, Women’s &amp; Children’s Unit and expansion of Medical Offices on the fifth floor of the new east wing.

Ribbon Cuttings, Openings &amp; Capital Improvements

### **Children’s Garden of Learning**

In November the community celebrated the seamless opening of a new home for Children’s Garden of Learning after the preschool was relocated to Lionshead to make way for construction of The Residences at Main Vail on a portion of the school’s former site. The $3 million facility is licensed for 61 students and features the use of 5 specially designed modular structures to meet the needs of the preschool. Children’s Garden of Learning was granted a lease with the town to operate at the new site for $10 per year for the next five years. The temporary location will allow time to identify a permanent home for the school while planning for implementation of the first phase of the Civic area Plan takes place which will repurpose the property, the former site of the charter bus lot.

The Residences at Main Vail

The culmination of more than two years of planning and coordination to make way for construction of Vail’s largest housing development took place in November with a groundbreaking ceremony for The Residences at Main Vail. Not since construction of the Chamonix Vail Townhomes and Vail Commons has such an impact been made in increasing the number of available homes for working residents. When completed in the summer of 2023, the $26 million development will include a mix of 72 one- and two-bedroom apartments containing at least 72 parking spaces onsite with additional means of meeting the transportation needs of the new residents. The central location near the Vail Town Center roundabout provides convenient pedestrian access to jobs and will be home to as many as 200 year-round and seasonal Vail residents. The new homes will be available for occupancy by persons and families who are employed a minimum of 30 hours per week, on average on an annual basis, at a business located within Eagle County. It is most likely, however, that leasing preference will be granted to those employees employed at businesses within the Town of Vail. ****South Frontage Road Roundabout Project****  
Construction of the South Frontage Road Roundabout project began April 12 and was substantially complete by November. The project has included construction of a two-lane roundabout just west of the Vail municipal building and Vail Health. It also includes an extension of the existing four-lane roadway section with landscape medians and sidewalks from the municipal building west to the Lionshead parking structure. The $6.5 million project has been funded by an allocation from the Vail Reinvestment Authority and additional participation from Vail Health and Eagle River Water &amp; Sanitation District. The improvements will provide increased capacity for traffic flowing from the Vail Town Center roundabout to the Lionshead parking structure while accommodating the increased traffic volumes at the new Vail Health South Frontage Road entrance and anticipated future growth and redevelopment within the Lionshead area. The improvements were identified during the early stages of the Vail Health redevelopment process as indicated within the Vail Health Hospital Site Specific Redevelopment Master Plan adopted in 2015. ****Public Works Shops Expansion****  
A groundbreaking ceremony was held in March to begin phase 1 of the Public Works Shops expansion. This phase, scheduled for completion in December 2021, allows for expansion of the shops building to house heavy equipment as well as remodels of the office area, breakroom and locker rooms. At nearly $20 million, this is one of the larger capital projects the town has undertaken in recent years. Due to historic low interest rates, the Town Council agreed to finance $15 million which will save $3.4 million over the long term if it had waited to accumulate cash to pay for the construction. Spanning 51 acres, the shops property has been the headquarters for critical town functions since 1979 and has undergone various expansions and modifications. Later phases identified in the Public Works Master Plan include a second level structure on top of the shops building, a redevelopment of the administration offices and up to 120 employee housing units on the site. ****I-70 West Vail Pass Auxiliary Lanes****  
In August town representatives joined with officials from the Colorado Department of Transportation to mark the beginning of the I-70 West Vail Pass Auxiliary Lanes project. Once completed in 2024, the project will improve safety and operations on West Vail Pass, including six wildlife underpasses and fencing.

Parking/Transportation Improvements

****Summer Parking****  
Daytime public parking remained free throughout the summer of 2021.The overnight public parking charge of $35 was reinstated to reflect the resurgence in demand and to address the need to minimize storage of vehicles. Town-managed event parking at the Ford Park and soccer field lots also returned to accommodate numerous events taking place. ****Winter Parking****  
Hourly parking rates established for the 2021-2022 winter season remained consistent with the previous season as recommended by the Parking &amp; Transportation Task Force. Discount parking passes were modified with discontinuation of the Red parking pass which had been previously used to access the Red Sandstone parking garage. Instead, the Pink pass was increased to $350 to allow expanded access to the Red Sandstone garage as well as Ford Park. The price of the Pink pass had not been increased since 2017. As a result of COVID-19 protocols, the annual recertification process for existing Value card holders was waived for the 2021-2022 season. ****RideVail****  
A new transit operations management system was launched in November. RideVail replaced the previously used Nextbus system and improves bus operations as well as facilitates better passenger information distribution with bus locations, arrival predictions, crowding levels and service alerts. The project was funded in part by a $350,000 grant from the Colorado Department of Transportation. ****Oversize/RV Parking****  
In May the Charter Bus Lot east of the Lionshead parking structure was closed to allow for construction of the Children’s Garden of Learning preschool. Parking for oversize vehicles 20 feet or longer was relocated to West Vail along the south side of the North Frontage Road across from Safeway. A permanent location is under review.

Guest/Customer Services Efficiencies, Innovation &amp; Technology

****EC Alert Changes****  
Eagle County’s EC Alert service announced a change in how it delivers non-emergency text messages effective Feb. 1 through the free mobile Everbridge app, while the delivery system for emergency messages, such as evacuations, would be unaffected. ****Website Redesign****  
The town launched a newly redesigned website in June. After a year of hard work and dedication, vailgov.com features improved navigation and robust search features in addition to providing a fresh modern look. 

Neighborhoods

****Community Picnics****  
The town’s annual Celebrating Community neighborhood picnic series returned to Bighorn Park and Donovan Pavilion in July and August. This was the 21st year for the picnics which provide community members an opportunity to offer comments and suggestions about various topics and to meet members of the Vail Town Council and town staff. The picnics had been postponed in 2020 due to COVID-19. ****Booth Lake Trailhead Parking Zone****  
To address neighborhood impacts of speeding and parking violations associated with popularity of the Booth Lake trail in East Vail, Town Council adopted an ordinance that increased penalties for parking violations by establishing the Booth Lake Trailhead Parking Zone. The enforcement zone, adopted in May, included Mann’s Ranch Road, Booth Falls Road, Booth Falls Court and the 2800 to 3700 block of the North Frontage Road. The ordinance was part of an overall effort to address neighborhood impacts which included a pilot closure of the trailhead parking lot during the summer. ****Booth Creek Trailhead Restroom****  
An open house was held in November to review options for a permanent restroom to be constructed at the Booth Creek trailhead. Neighborhood residents and other users of the trail attended to provide input. The town has supplied portable toilets at the trailhead during the summer since 2018. ****Stephens Park Renovation****  
A renovation of the Stephens Park children’s play area was completed in the spring. The updated playground includes improved play structures, new climbers, slide and swings, an oversized tree stump climbing wall and includes artwork by artist Ben Roth in the form of giant prehistoric “horsetail” plants scattered throughout. ****Vail Valley Drive Traffic Pattern****  
Advisory bike lanes remained along Vail Valley Drive in 2021 and were extended a few hundred yards to the west based on the successful trial in 2020. The traffic pattern allows for two-way vehicular traffic to share a narrowed single center lane while pedestrians and bicyclists utilized the bike lanes on each side separated from vehicular traffic by dashed lines. This pedestrian accommodation traffic measure has been growing in popularity throughout the United States and in Eagle County. ****Emergency Safety Fencing****  
Working with its partners from Colorado Division of Parks and Wildlife, emergency safety fencing in East Vail remained in place for a second season to keep bighorn sheep and other wildlife from accessing the Frontage Road and I-70. The temporary fencing will remain until permanent fencing can be installed by CDOT in 2022.

Housing

### **Housing Priorities**

In the fall Town Manager Scott Robson presented a list of future housing priorities and associated costs to illustrate how a dedicated funding source could help sustain the community’s multi-faceted housing needs. Among the list of top priorities was redevelopment of Timber Ridge Village at an estimated cost of $70 million. The presentation followed a decision by Town Council to ask voters to approve a half-cent sales tax increase to be used to fund housing programs. The ballot question, which was approved by voters in November, included a 30-year sunset provision and was estimated to generate $3.5 million annually. The town’s adopted goal is to acquire 1,000 new deed restrictions by the year 2027. At the current rate of acquisition, it is projected the town will reach its goal by 2026. ****Housing Goal Progress****  
Progress was made during the year toward the Vail Housing 2027 Strategic Plan’s adopted goal of acquiring 1,000 new deed-restrictions by the year 2027. At the time of adoption, 688 deed-restrictions were recorded on properties within the town. As of Dec. 15, that number had increased by 48% to 1,024, with The Residence at Main Vail approved and underway. ****Duplex Acquisition****  
In July the town acquired an existing duplex home in the East Vail neighborhood as part of its ongoing buy-down program for town employees. The property is located at 5137 Black Gore Drive and includes 6 bedrooms and 5 bathrooms. The purchase price was $2.1 million and will be added to the town’s deed-restricted housing inventory. ****Condominium Acquisition****  
The town also purchased a 1-bedroom, 1-bathroom condominium located at 2079 Chamonix Lane Unit 1 for $410,000. The property is a subsidized price appreciation cap home which was resold to a Town of Vail employee via an internal employee lottery for $262,500.

**C**ommunity Opinion Survey on Possible Ballot Questions

Working with public opinion consultants from Magellan Strategies and Summit Information Services, the Town Council fielded a community opinion survey July 16-25 to understand voter opinions regarding possible ballot questions for the Nov. 2 election. The survey measured opinions about a sales tax ballot question to fund the town’s residential housing programs and a separate lodging tax ballot question for Vail Local Marketing District year-round marketing efforts. Results of the survey were used to forward a sales tax question to voters in November which won approval.  
****New Online Employee Housing Compliance Process****  
The Housing Department used an online sworn compliance statement and compliance form during its annual employee housing compliance process during the year. The improved online process replaced a notarized affidavit requirement and allowed owners to click, upload and sign all the documents online. Letters were mailed Dec. 10 to all deed-restricted property owners with a compliance deadline of Feb. 1, 2022. Also, as part of the compliance process, the Town Council approved a $250 administrative fee to incentivize deed-restricted property owners to submit their annual deed restriction compliance documents on time and to help achieve the town’s goal of 100% compliance. ****Vail InDEED****  
The Vail InDEED program, in which the town acquires perpetual deed restrictions from private property owners subject to a mutually accepted purchase agreement, continued to provide opportunities for new home buyers. Since its inception in 2016 Vail InDEED has been used to acquire an additional 167 deed restrictions at a total investment of approximately $11.5 million. In total, more than 367 year-round and seasonal residents of Vail have been provided homes through the program. ****Vail Local Housing Authority****  
The Vail Local Housing Authority realized numerous accomplishments in 2021 including continued implementation of the Vail InDEED program which resulted in the purchase of 12 new deed-restrictions on behalf of the town from 28 applications submitted. The program was funded by $2.5 million budgeted by the Town Council. The VLHA also helped facilitate permanent housing funding with voter approval of a half-cent sales tax increase earmarked for housing, Ballot Initiative 2A. Other activities included: overhaul of the annual compliance verification process; evaluation of various land use tools and recommended modifications; and ongoing discussions with Colorado Department of Transportation regarding a potential housing partnership on a CDOT-owned parcel in East Vail. ****Housing Resales****  
Two Chamonix Vail townhomes were resold to qualified buyers in July and August. The 1,255 sq. ft., 2-bedroom, 2-bath, 2-car garage homes sold for $520,831 and $$524,900, respectively. Chamonix Vail homes are deed-restricted and have a resale price appreciation cap of 1.5% per annum plus any approved capital improvements.  
An internal town employee home purchase program launched in 2020 had it second sale with the purchase a 567 sq. ft. 1-bedroom, 1-bath at Vail Heights Condominiums for $262,500. The town had purchased the property in 2021 for $410,000 with the intent to sell the home to a town employee with a deed restriction in place. The Town of Vail is one of the larger employers in the community. ****Staff Addition****  
In response to growing demands within the Housing Department, a new third member was added to the department’s staff. Martha Anderson transferred from the town’s Finance Department to fill the role of housing coordinator. As the new housing coordinator, Anderson will assist the senior housing coordinator, Lynne Campbell, with day-to-day operations and administration. In November, as part of the adoption of the 2022 town budget, the Town Council authorized the appropriation of the funds needed to add a fourth staff member to the department in 2022. 

Environmental Sustainability

****Sustainable Destination Recertification****  
Following a rigorous audit process, Vail was recertified as a Sustainable Destination under the Mountain IDEAL Standard during the year. The coveted achievement builds upon the initial certification in 2017 when Vail became the first certified sustainable destination in the U.S. ****Bicycle Friendly Community Silver Level Designation****  
The town again earned designation as a Silver Bicycle Friendly Community as selected by the League of American Bicyclists following a 2021 assessment. Vail was elevated to a silver designation in both 2014 and 2017 after earning a bronze status in 2009. The award recognizes Vail for its commitment to creating transportation and recreational resources that benefit its residents of all ages and abilities while encouraging healthier and more sustainable transportation choices.  
****Community Recycling Report****  
Through the first three quarters of 2021, the town achieved a 33% recycling rate. A total of 8,289 tons of municipal solid waste, 3,781 tons of recycling and 293 tons of compost was collected in 2021. There was strong participation in the Celebrate Green! Zero Waste program for special events leading to a cumulative 82.1% diversion rate.  
****Pilot Residential Curbside Compost Program****  
In January the town solicited proposals to partner with a qualified waste hauler to introduce a pilot program for a residential curbside compost program with participation of between 25 and 100 households within designated Vail neighborhoods. Vail Honeywagon was selected to implement the program beginning in July within West Vail. As the year was coming to an end, there were 55 households participating in the pilot program. The Eagle County Climate Action Plan establishes a 30% diversion rate of all waste going to the landfill by 2030 with at least 80% of organics being diverted by 2030. The pilot program was used to determine if a curbside compost program would be feasible to implement fully throughout Vail. ****Designated Open Space****  
For the first time since 2005, the town’s inventory of designated open space was increased following action by the Town Council in February to reclassify a nearly 50-acre town-owned parcel in East Vail to designated open space. The property was donated to the town in 2019 with the previous owners requiring the zoning change. There are now 58 town-owned properties totaling 581 acres as designated open space – only a vote of Vail’s electorate can change the use or dispose of designated open space. ****Earth Day****  
In celebration of Earth Day on April 22, complimentary native wildflower and vegetable seeds were distributed in collaboration with the Vail Public Library One Book, One Valley program and NEA Big Read Grant. In addition, the town invited neighbors to join them in a Poo Patrol effort to clean up parks containing excessive dog waste: Stephens Park, Bighorn Park, Ellefson Park, Buffehr Creek Park, Red Sandstone Park and Davos trailhead. Twenty buckets totaling 200 pounds of dog waste were collected in three hours. ****Climate Analysis****  
A new climate analysis released by the Rocky Mountain Climate Organization in August projected that Eagle County will see many more extremely hot summer days by mid-century, with even larger increases later, unless global heat-trapping emissions are sharply reduced. ****Love Vail Trails Cleanup****  
In May a Love Vail Trails Cleanup was held in partnership with U.S. Forest Service, Vail Valley Mountain Trails Alliance, Adopt-A-Trail, Eagle Valley Land Trust, Vail Resorts and Walking Mountain Science Center. Volunteers were asked to show the trails in Vail some love before the transition into summer. ****Go EV City****  
In October the Town Council passed a resolution to become a Go Electric Vehicle (GoEV) City, pledging to support programs, policies, incentives and regulatory approaches to transition 100% of all vehicles within the Town of Vail to zero emissions by 2050. Staff will develop an EV Readiness Plan in early 2022 to serve as a roadmap for the wholistic transition to electric and zero-emissions vehicles. ****E-bikes for Essential Workers****  
Free e-bikes were awarded to seven income qualified workers who applied to take part in the eBikes for Essentials program in a partnership between the town, National Renewable Energy Laboratory and QuietKat. The program was initiated in September and was designed to demonstrate that e-bikes are a safe, healthy and convenient way to take essential trips around town. ****Mill Creek Contamination****  
A contamination event in Mill Creek was discovered on Sept. 20 when citizens reported seeing dead fish downstream in Gore Creek near the International Bridge. The event resulted in a multi-agency response team coordinated by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment with participation by the town’s environmental sustainability team, Colorado Parks and Wildlife, and Eagle River Water &amp; Sanitation District. The response included documenting the impacts to aquatic life, capturing water samples and completing a survey of aquatic macroinvertebrates in the impacted area. As a result of the event, Vail Resorts and Eagle River Water &amp; Sanitation District have coordinated to establish protocols to prevent future spills from occurring.  ****Gore Creek Fish Cam****  
An underwater fish cam installed in July by the town’s environmental team in partnership with Eagle Valley Wild, received additional attention when an alert citizen took screen shots after noticing something unusual about the water and forwarded it to authorities who were already investigating a fish kill event on Mill and Gore creeks. ****Stream Corridor Protection Ordinance****  
In October a proposed stream corridor protection ordinance was presented to the Planning and Environmental Commission for its first review. As drafted, the ordinance establishes a 10-foot “no-mow-zone” along streams and creeks in Vail and tightens building setbacks from waterways to 25-feet from the ordinary high-water mark. Additional reviews were to be scheduled by the review board in January 2022. ****Storm Drain Citation****  
In November a local contractor received a police citation for depositing waste material into a storm drain after investigating an incident that involved the unlawful deposit of water-based paint into the drains. The paint was being used to stripe a nearby parking lot. Town responders used a vacuum truck to remove the paint from the drains. The penalty for depositing waste material into a storm drain is punishable by a fine of up to $2,650. ****LED Bulb Swap****  
The Vail Public Library hosted two LED bulb swaps during the months of March and August to promote free and easy ways for community members to take climate action. Community members were encouraged to save money and cut climate pollution by exchanging two inefficient old-tech lightbulbs for two high-efficiency LEDs. One hundred and sixty-nine LED bulbs were given out, which will equate to a 173,067 pounds reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 22 years. This is a cost savings of $15,718.94 over 22 years and the equivalent of removing 17 vehicles from the road. ****Sustainable Landscape Series****  
In place of its annual Sustainable Landscape Workshop, the Environmental Sustainability Department worked with High Five Access Media, Betty Ford Alpine Gardens, ET Irrigation and the Palisade Insectary to create Sustainable Landscape Video Series which can be viewed at [https://www.highfivemedia.org/town-vail](https://www.highfivemedia.org/town-vail). ****Gore Creek Riparian Planting Projects****  
The town continued efforts to reestablish native plants along town-owned sections of Gore Creek. More than 5,000 plants were installed during 2021 bringing the total number of new plantings to over 20,000 since 2016. Native willows, chokecherries, serviceberries, currants and wild rose, plus a variety of wetland sedges and grasses were among nearly 40 different plant species installed. The planting projects are part of the overall Restore the Gore efforts with a goal of having Gore Creek removed from the EPA list of Impaired Waterways. The new plants will help to filter pollutants and sediment, slow runoff, provide shade to help keep water temperatures low, create habitat for native fauna and reduce erosion. The project will continue in 2022, anticipating nearly 4,000 additional plants. ****Gore Creek Test Samples****  
While Gore Creek macroinvertebrate populations still did not meet state standards for aquatic life in 2019, steady progress can be seen in the data. Increases in aquatic insect populations can be attributed to reductions in stormwater pollution, the elimination of foliar-applied pesticides on town property and the 20,000 native trees and shrubs planted along Gore Creek since 2016. ****Spills Hotline****  
The 24-hour Gore Creek spill reporting hotline (970-476-GORE) continued to receive calls about instances of stormwater dumping in 2021. Vigilant community members who reached out via the hotline this year helped town staff respond to spills including hydraulic fluid, carpet cleaner and paint, preventing some of these harmful pollutants from reaching Gore Creek. ****Sole Power****  
The 11th annual Sole Power Challenge, a free green community challenge offered to the entire Eagle Valley and facilitated by the town, saw 309 members participate in the program. They logged nearly 53,000 miles in their daily commuting activities, which included cycling, walking, skating and other non-motorized travel. Their efforts prevented over 48,000 pounds of carbon from entering the atmosphere. Participants had the chance to win prizes donated by generous community partners. ****Hard to Recycle Event****  
Two free recycling events were held in May and November to collect electronic, yard and household hazardous waste, vinyl banners and bike tubes, and to provide paper shredding services. Over 20 tons of materials were collected and recycled. The event was funded by fees from the “kick the bag habit” program in which a 10-cent per bag fee is collected by the two grocery stores in Vail for customers who choose to opt out of reusable bags.   ****Trees for Vail****  
The town sponsored the distribution of 100 native trees and shrubs in June as part of its annual Trees for Vail program. Reinstated in 2009 after a long hiatus, Trees for Vail has included volunteer planting projects as well as the free public giveaway for residents. ****Volunteer Trail Host Program****  
Volunteers from the town’s Trail Host program began greeting trail users for the third summer season in June. The program provides helpful information and resources at busy East Vail trailheads to promote trail etiquette and to offer recommendations on a variety of guest services, including less-traveled trails. In anticipation of a significant increase in trail use, the hosts increased their presence during peak times and updated summer hiking trail maps were distributed. The Trail Host program is a component of the Vail Welcome Centers. ****EnergySmart Partnership****  
The town continued its partnership with EnergySmart Colorado to offer free energy audits and double rebates for energy efficiency projects for Vail residents and businesses. This included 26 home energy assessments completed through November resulting in an estimated reduction of 6.24 metric tons of CO2e through quick fixes installed at assessments; 16 residential rebates provided through November, which resulted in an estimated 12 metric tons of CO2e reduced through home energy improvements rebated; and 6 commercial rebates provided through November, which resulted in an estimated 315.3 metric tons of CO2e reduced through business and multi-family energy improvements rebated. The estimated annual carbon reduction in the town through participation in the EnergySmart Colorado program was 333.54 metric tons of CO2e through November. This is the equivalent of annual energy usage for 40 average sized homes. ****Climate Action Collaborative****  
The town continued to be an active participant in the Eagle County Climate Action Collaborative, which works to advance the greenhouse gas reduction goals established in the county-wide Climate Action Plan. In 2021 the town adopted the 2020 Climate Action Plan Update, adding a benchmark goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030 in addition to the previous goals of a 25% reduction in emissions by 2025 and 80% reduction by 2050. A few projects undertaken by the collaborative in 2021 included: both Avon and Vail passed a resolution to become [GoEV cities](https://www.goevcity.org), pledging to create an Electric Vehicle Action Plan that dedicates time and resources to tackling transportation emissions. Eagle County governments got started on developing a Regional Transportation Authority, with the hope of creating a more effective public transportation system. Town of Vail implemented four DC Fast EV charging stations and an EV supercharging station was built at Edwards Station, equipped with four universal Electrify America Chargers and eight Tesla superchargers. With these additions, Eagle County now has over 80 charging locations and is now in the top-10 most EV-friendly counties in the United States. The Climate Action Collaborative developed a governing board to provide a nexus between action and legislation in the county and launched the Trends with Benefits campaign, encouraging community members to work from home or leave their cars behind twice a week to help reduce transportation emissions. In addition, the Collaborative created two community recycling guides, diverted 27,918 pounds of waste through zero waste initiatives at special events and achieved its goal to divert 30% of overall waste in Eagle County from the landfill. 

Public Safety

****COVID-19 Safety Protocols****  
Safety protocols enacted by the police and fire departments allowed for emergency response, routine patrols and calls for service to be provided without interruption. Attempts were made to limit exposure to residents and guests by taking non-emergency calls over the phone. ****Fire &amp; Emergency Services Calls****  
Vail Fire &amp; Emergency Services responded to 2,042 calls for service in 2021. This included 61 fires of various types, which consisted of 23 vehicle fires, 11 wildland fires, 7 structure fires and 30 miscellaneous fires. The remainder of the calls for service included 50 physical rescues, 715 emergency medical incidents (including vehicle accidents), 606 false alarms, 57 hazardous materials incidents, 11 other hazardous conditions, 197 service calls and 345 other calls for service. Vail Fire &amp; Emergency Services also responded to calls for assistance out of Vail 292 times. Of the responses outside the Town of Vail, 152 were to the Vail Pass area. These responses are provided as part of an intergovernmental agreement with Eagle County. ****Structure Fires****  
Fire crews responded to seven structure fires within the Town of Vail. One fire in the Sandstone neighborhood resulted in heavy damage to a condominium unit. Although there was smoke and water damage in adjoining units, the fire was contained to the unit in which the fire originated.  
****Wildfire Mitigation****  
One-hundred sixty property owners took part in another season of free chipping services provided by Vail Fire resulting in 162 tons of slash removed. Additionally, all homes in Main Vail received a complimentary curbside wildfire hazard evaluation. Residents were provided a copy of their evaluation and encouraged to contact the department with questions about defensible space or measures they could take to help protect their home from the threat of wildfire. ****Booth Creek Prescribed Fire in East Vail****  
A prescribed fire was successfully conducted by Vail Fire and Emergency Services on approximately 20 acres of town owned land in the Katsos Ranch area of East Vail and 1 acre of land owned by the Colorado Department of Transportation in the spring. The project involved the burning of grasses and scattered brush to improve winter range for the East Vail bighorn sheep herd. The project additionally reduced wildfire fuels adjacent to the community and served as a prelude to an environmental assessment process involving the larger East Vail Fuels Reduction project initiated by the U.S. Forest Service. ****Wildfire Ready Challenge****  
In April Vail Fire introduced its Wildfire Ready Challenge which incorporated five steps over the course of five weeks that residents and property owners could take to be better prepared for a sudden wildfire. The campaign produced positive results in which 100 people signed up for EC Alerts, 86 people registered their household on Community Connect, nearly 30 online users familiarized themselves with Vail’s evacuation plan, there were 346 page views on vailwildfire.com and 39 properties served with the free chipping program. ****Stage 2 Fire Restrictions****  
Due to continued dry weather and dangerous fire conditions throughout Colorado’s high country, Stage 2 Fire Restrictions became effective in town and elsewhere in Eagle County June 25. The restrictions included a ban on all fireworks and open burning. The Stage 2 restrictions remained in place until July 9. ****July 4th Fireworks Cancelled****  
The town joined other communities across the state in cancelling its professional fireworks display on July 4th noting unfavorable conditions as well as personnel deployments to existing wildfires that had already depleted the town’s response resources. ****Wildfire Season****  
The 2021 wildfire season locally was not as significant as 2020 but still had a few notable fires.  The Sylvan Lake fire which started June 20 grew to over 5,000 acres in the first 24 hours forcing the evacuation of homes in more remote parts of Eagle and Gypsum and closing Sylvan Lake State Park for several weeks. Crews were able to successfully extinguish more than 10 small wildfires in the area in 2021 before they presented a hazard to public safety. Across the West wildfire again in 2021 caused significant community damage and blanketed Vail in smoke throughout the summer. These wildfires reinforce the need for every person to have a personal wildfire action plan that includes a “to go list” as well as an evacuation plan. These fires also emphasized that the survival of a home is largely dependent upon the actions taken before a fire occurs which will make it resistant to wildfire generated embers. In support of the wildland fire suppression across the West, personnel from Vail Fire and Emergency Services deployed to 14 wildland fires including two of the largest and most destructive fires in California history, the Dixie and Caldor fires. ****Wildfire Behind Public Works Construction Site****  
Multiple spot fires over a quarter acre on town property adjacent to U.S. Forest land behind the Public Works Shops were quickly contained by responders in October. The cause was determined to be a downed power line which was responsible for a brief power outage in East Vail. ****Fire Prevention Week****  
Vail Fire and Emergency Services embraced the opportunity to recognize National Fire Prevention Week Oct. 3 with in-person activities. Staff from VFES held an open house and visited local schools with activities designed to reinforce this year’s theme of “Learn the Sounds of Safety.”        ****Community Connect****  
Community Connect [Eagle County Community Connect](https://www.communityconnect.io/info/co-eaglecounty)  continues to be a valuable tool which   allows residents and commercial property owners to share critical information about their household or property with first responders. Users simply create a profile and enter critical property and occupant information which is then made available to public safety agencies at the time of dispatch. ****Gas Leak Evacuations****  
In October a gas leak at a construction site in West Vail caused an estimated 40 to 50 people to be evacuated from their homes overnight. The incident prompted the fire department to encourage residents to provide keys to the fire department so that they can be placed in a Knox box. This allows firefighters to make rapid entry into units without damaging doors or windows. ****Police Calls****   
Police responded to close to 29,300 calls for service and wrote approximately 1,594 incident reports and 310 traffic crash reports during the year. Officers arrested nearly 480 people, issued citations to over 1,151 people and issued over 863 warnings for traffic and code violations. Detectives investigated 80 new cases in 2021 while also managing cases from previous years. The department’s clearance rate for part 1 crimes, including theft, burglary, robbery, assault and arson was 24.6%. ****Eagle Valley Mental Health****   
The Eagle Valley Co-Responder Team completed its third year of service. The co-responder team consists of law enforcement, mental health clinicians from the Hope Center and Eagle County Paramedics. Vail officers handled over 500 mental health-related calls in Vail in 2021. The Hope Center and Eagle Valley Behavioral Health have increased mental health resources so successfully, most mental health calls are going directly to a clinician, which has been one of the goals of the program since inception.   ****Surveillance Camera Footage****  
Surveillance camera footage was shared with the public during numerous instances throughout the year to assist in investigating a variety of incidents, including an armed assault on a bus, felony menacing and criminal mischief at the transportation center, an individual taking pictures in bathroom stalls, various thefts, including high-end bicycles and vehicles, as well as residential burglaries. Community members provided leads in assisting the department in identifying persons of interest and suspects, including a 23-year-old man and 46-year-old man charged with felony menacing and a 52-year-old man charged with third degree assault over a mask dispute.  ****Bike Thief****  
A 61-year-old Denver man was sentenced to 7 years in prison after pleading guilty to numerous counts of theft, criminal mischief and other charges related to an investigation initiated by Vail Police following a local burglary and theft of a mountain bike. ****Assault Arrest****  
In April police received help from the community in identifying a suspect accused of assaulting a passenger on a Vail bus in late March. The 46-year-old man was arrested without incident in Leadville. ****Catalytic Converter Thefts****  
During the spring, police held a theft prevention event to remind residents and guests to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity after thieves attempted to steal catalytic converters from vehicles parked at Vail Mountain School in East Vail. ****Burglary Arrest****  
Working with Silverthorne, Avon and Eagle County law enforcement, Vail police arrested two suspects in June following a foot chase in the West Vail neighborhood. The suspects were charged with various burglaries, thefts and criminal possession of financial devices. ****Enforcement of Wildlife and Trash Violations****  
In July residents were advised that a new enforcement strategy was being implemented for the 2021 bear season by the Police Department’s Code Enforcement Division. Rather than issuing multiple education-focused warnings, the department shifted to a Town Council directed policy of issuing just one warning to a residence where a violation is found before proceeding to municipal summons. This enforcement change resulted in 313 warnings issued and 9 municipal summonses, over twice the amount from the previous year. Fortunately, the 2021 bear season was mild compared to last year’s feeding frenzy, resulting in less stress-testing of the community’s trash containers and fewer warnings.  
****Bull Moose Relocation****  
Police worked with Colorado Parks and Wildlife officers to tranquilize and remove a young bull moose out of the Lionshead parking structure for the well-being of both the moose and the people in the area. The behavior of the moose indicated it was becoming accustomed to the area and was reluctant to leave on its own. The moose was relocated to a remote area outside Craig and released in appropriate moose habitat. ****Hazardous Materials Spill****  
The driver of a pickup was issued a traffic citation after causing a hazardous materials spill on Interstate 70 in October when a 55-gallon drum containing a resin used in concrete construction fell out of the back of the truck eastbound at milemarker 174. The incident caused a four-hour closure of the interstate while recovery crews worked to clean up the spill. ****Emergency Responder Recognition****  
Members of the public were invited to join Eagle County emergency responders for the 19th annual emergency responder recognition in August. The service recognized the three law enforcement officers, two firefighters and air ambulance pilot who lost their lives in serving the citizens of Eagle County. ****Coffee with a Cop****  
Showing its commitment to community involvement, the department hosted four Coffee with a Cop events during the year in which officers grab coffee at a local coffee shop and address questions and concerns from community members. ****National Drug Take Back****  
In addition to the Police Department’s year-round disposal site for unused household medications located in the Municipal Building, police participated in National Drug Take Back events in the spring and fall, collectively collecting over 42 pounds of medications. The events were coordinated by the Safe Disposal Program, which is a partnership involving the Police Department, Eagle County Sheriff’s Office, Eagle River Water &amp; Sanitation District and Vail Health. ****Shop with a Cop****  
This event allowed local elementary school children to be paired with a law enforcement officer to shop for holiday gifts for themselves and family members. Shop with a Cop in December included 24 Vail children shopping and wrapping presents with officers.

Art &amp; Culture

## ****Art in Public Places****

### Capital Projects

- “Knee-high to a Grasshopper,” an interactive, play-based art piece created by Ben Roth, was installed to complete renovation of the Stephens Park playground. This was the tenth playground built by the town’s design team in collaboration with an artist creating a unique play environment.
- Floyd Elzinga‘s “Pine Cone” weathering steel sculpture was installed at Vail Golf and Nordic Clubhouse.
- Frederick Prescott’s “Lion” sculpture was relocated to the western stairs of Lionshead Welcome Center.
- Renowned Colorado photographer John Fielder was recognized for his assistance following installation of his image, “Sunset, Gore Range Reflection, Eagles Nest Wilderness,” behind the dais in the recently renovated Town Council Chambers.
- The donation of three significant sculptures from the collection of Vicki and Kent Logan were officially accepted into the town’s public art collection: Jason Middlebrook “We are all building nests;” Nathan Mabry “Two Vessels (Unpacked);” and Brad Kahlahmer Waqui “Totem.”

Also during the year, Town Council approved a request to continue further design development for the Ford Park Art Space with Harry Teague Architects.

New Murals 

Two new murals by artists Olive Moya and the collective duo Pedro Barrios and Jaime Molina were completed. Moya’s mural, “Mrs. Charles in the Sun (Ice Bar at Mid-Vail late 1960s),” was installed in the Vail Village Transportation Center, while Pedro Barrios and Jaime Molina returned to Vail to transform five large cylindrical vents west of Dobson Ice Arena. Since 2019, Colorado artists have been invited by AIPP to enliven and enhance Vail's public spaces.  
****Free Seasonal Art Walks****  
The popular free one-hour Wednesday public art tours continued during the summer July through Sept.1.  
****Summervail 50th Anniversary****  
In July, AIPP partnered with the Vail Symposium and Vail Public Library to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Summervail Art Workshop. Events included a display in the library’s community room and a program featuring some of Summervail’s founders and instructors moderated by Pulitzer-Prize Winning New York Magazine Senior Art Critic and columnist Jerry Saltz.  
****Fifteenth Annual Vail Winterfest****  
Sponsored with Doe Browning  
Harkening back to the initial Vail Winterfest ice installations visualized by renowned artist Lawrence Argent, Art in Public Places invited celebrated visual artist Olive Moya to collaborate with Alpine Ice to create designs featuring Moya’s distinctive woven forms and shapes which opened in December. The festivities included colorful lanterns strung high above the International Bridge in Vail Village.

Vail Public Library

Vail Public Library provided in-person services for its users throughout 2021. Ongoing COVID-19 protocols remained in place and by September the library returned to its regular service hours. The majority of the library’s facilities and its full range of services were reopened as normal to serve its patrons, observing COVID-19 protocols to ensure public safety, until added measures were put back into place during the holiday spike in cases.

Looking to the future, Vail Public Library began an assessment of its facility needs to help direct grant applications. Potential future projects include upgrades to energy efficiencies, additional ADA parking and improved wildfire protections.

The library also made arrangements for the return of the book drop at the West Vail Mall in front of Safeway next year. Removed during the pandemic, this much-needed service will be in place early in 2022 with a new book drop in the same convenient location. 

### **StoryWalk**

In February the library celebrated the opening of StoryWalk®, a year-round, outdoor reading experience. Located around the pond at Bighorn Park in East Vail, the picturesque setting allowed visitors to read a book one page at a time as they strolled between fixed placards. Started at the Kellogg-Hubbard Library in Montpelier, Vt., StoryWalks® can be found across the country. Funded largely through a Cares Act Grant, the Vail StoryWalk® was the ideal “pandemic project,” a wonderful way to enjoy literacy and nature in a safe setting. Friends of Vail Public Library and a local StoryWalk® Committee oversee the project, which hosts a new book seasonally. Partnerships and support for the StoryWalk® include Town of Vail, The Literacy Project, Eagle Valley Land Trust and Vail Valley Behavioral Health. 

****Common Cents Colorado****

The financial literacy initiative, Common Cents Colorado, was placed on hiatus for the year due to the pandemic. The program is scheduled to return in early 2022, with classes for Town of Vail employees, and possibly for the general public later in the year.

****Friends of Vail Public Library****

The Friends of Vail Public Library support the library through donations of time and treasure. Over the past year, Friends’ contributions were used in conjunction with the Vail StoryWalk® Project in Bighorn Park. Additionally, monies from the Friends’ group added to the digitization project of the early Vail Trail newspapers for the Colorado Historic Newspapers Collection. Also, this past year, Children’s Programs and Summer Reading were revitalized with the help of Friends’ funding, bringing safe, new, and fresh versions of long-time favorites.

Retired and donated titles continued to bring in funding through sales in the library’s Book Nook, while the summer’s “pop-up” book sales turned out to be a delightful option for guests and locals alike. All of these efforts brought in dollars for materials, programs and services for the library. As 2021 closes, the Friends of Vail Public Library Annual Appeal takes place, bringing in thousands of dollars in support of Vail Public Library in appreciation of its role as a civic and cultural institution. To thank those donors, the Champagne Celebration Event, which had to be canceled because of pandemic concerns, will return in 2022 as a summer event. Friends’ time and treasure continues to add value to Vail Public Library as the open and inclusive community resource it is. 

****50th Anniversary Celebrations – Summervail and the Vail Symposium****

The library hosted celebrations on behalf of the 50th Anniversaries of Summervail and the Vail Symposium. Displays included the Capsule Collection curated by original instructors from the Summervail Art Workshop Legacy Project and Vail Symposium’s Limited-Edition Prints by artist Thomas W. Benton. The exhibits were formally introduced to the community at a celebration in July, which included founders from both Summervail and the Vail Symposium. 

****Children’s Services @ your library****

In addition to the debut of the Vail StoryWalk® at Bighorn Park during the winter, summer 2021 brought children’s services back to the library in an exciting new arena, when programs moved outdoors. Summer Reading Programs, Storytimes, Bravo Concerts and a long-awaited Harry Potter Party, were all held in the library’s backyard. Locals and guests came together for fun and learning, eager to be together, in-person, once again.

The library’s “Little Free Libraries” enjoyed a facelift from local and visiting teens who repaired and repainted them with new inspiration. The “Little Free Libraries” are located behind Vail Public Library and in Vail parks: Bighorn, Ellefson and Stephens; and in Stratton Flats in Gypsum.

Outdoor programming concluded with the return of the “Touch a Truck” Event. Over 200 people showed up to beep horns, kick tires and dream of a truck-operating-future at Ford Park.

Storytimes and local school visits returned inside the library for fall and winter. Storytimes take place on Mondays and Wednesdays, with Bilingual Storytime on Thursdays. Locals and visitors alike are welcome. The ever popular “Take and Make” art bags also returned with projects for young children to make at home. 

****Bilingual Story Time****

Summer brought the return of Bilingual Story Time, utilizing the library’s backyard for a fun-filled hour of stories and songs. Attendees varied each Thursday morning with locals and guests learning to speak Spanish with bilingual staff. 

****Healthy Lifestyle Series****

Healthy Lifestyle Series continues to be the most popular of the library’s programs, not missing a beat with pandemic interruptions. Digital versions of Gentle Yoga and Zumba classes drew attendees among guests, locals and other states, brought to participants via Zoom.

Evenings of Engagement @ your library

Evenings of Engagement resumed outdoors over the summer, with concert favorites performing monthly June through September in the library’s backyard. Guests enjoyed the setting as much as the music. 

****One Book, One Valley****

Celebrating its 10th year, the communitywide reading event, One Book, One Valley (OBOV), received an NEA Big Read Grant, through Arts Midwest. Featuring the title “Lab Girl,” by scientist Hope Jahren, numerous events throughout the year brought discussion of contemporary issues through literature. Communitywide programs benefited from partnerships with seven organizations around the country, along with local organizations: Betty Ford Alpine Gardens, Walking Mountains Science Center and the town’s Environmental Sustainability Department. 

****Digital Archives Initiative****

The library's collection of digitized materials continued to grow in 2021. Virtually Vail Local Digital Archive holds four collections: Vintage Vail Quilt, Vail Valley Voices Oral Histories, Art in Vail and Vail Area History. The collection includes transcripts, scanned photographs, recorded histories, and documents, with 12 new oral histories added this past year. The library continued in its contract with the Colorado State Library to add early editions of the Vail Trail to the Colorado Historic Newspapers Collection. Years 1974 – 1979 were added this past year, with the project continuing in 2022.  

### **Sustainable practices @ your library**

Vail Public Library is a member of the town’s Actively Green Program. For recertification in 2021, the Sustainability Handbook for Vail Public Library was created, identifying practices specific to the library. In partnership with the One Book, One Valley Event in 2021, the town’s Environmental Sustainability Department hosted a seed exchange in early spring.

The library also hosted two, LED bulb swaps during the months of March and August. The swap was designed to promote free and easy ways for community members to act on behalf of climate change, save money and cut pollution. Two older, less efficient lightbulbs were swapped for two, high-efficiency LED bulbs. One hundred and sixty-nine LED bulbs were given out, which equates to a reduction of 173,067 pounds of greenhouse-gas emissions over the next 22 years. The swap brought a cost savings of $15,718.94 over 22 years, the equivalent of removing 17 vehicles from the road. 

Awards, Celebrations &amp; Recognition

****Police Recognition****  
An accreditation recertification from the Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police and a CACP American Spirit Award were presented to the Police Department in August. The department achieved its initial accreditation by CACP in 2010. The 2021 spirit award was given in recognition of overcoming challenges of resources, manpower and financial limitations by remining nimble and flexible throughout the pandemic. ****Great Place to Work****  
The town was recertified as a Great Place to Work® following a review of workplace ratings provided by employees through an anonymous survey. The town’s first certification occurred in 2016. To achieve the workplace certification, survey metrics must exceed a 70 percent benchmark. The town’s 2021 recertification process was conducted by researchers from Great Place to Work® based in San Francisco. ****Gold Certification for Welcome Centers****  
The town’s Welcome Centers were recognized by the Colorado Tourism Office as a Colorado Concierge Gold Business. To obtain certification, the staff and volunteer were required to conduct online training which included segments on public health and safety, outdoor recreation and Leave No Trace Principles.

In Memory

****Adam Palmer, Seth Bossung and Andy Jessen****  
A backcountry trip turned tragic Feb. 19 when the greater community lost three rising leaders to an avalanche near Ophir Pass in San Juan County. The three, Adam Palmer, Seth Bossung and Andy Jessen, were remembered for their love of family, love of life and community service. ****David Gorsuch****  
The community mourned the passing of David Gorsuch, 82, who died at home on June 26 after battling cancer. Gorsuch and wife Renie were fellow ski racers and were members of the 1960 U.S. Ski Team. They opened a ski shop in Crested Butte in 1962 and in 1966 opened their store in Vail where it grew to become one of Vail’s iconic businesses. ****Ben Krueger****  
The man responsible for Vail’s early recreation amenities, Ben Krueger, was remembered for his many accomplishments after passing in November. As the first manager of the Vail Metro Rec District, Kruger was instrumental in early development of the golf course, tennis courts, ball fields, soccer and rugby fields, and outdoor ice skating facilities. He also helped install snow making systems for Vail Mountain. ****Roger Tilkemeier****  
An early champion of the ski industry, Roger Tilkemeier, died in November. He was remembered for his leadership role in the early days of the U.S. Ski Association as well as special projects manager for Vail Resorts, formerly Vail Associates. A horseman, he and his wife Jeanne owned and operated the Spraddle Creek Livery Stables and Vail Sleigh Rides. In his later life, he helped found the Eagle Valley Land Trust and successfully spearheaded an effort to memorialize Vail founder Pete Seibert with the creation and installation of a bronze statue which can be seen near Gondola One. ****Monika Roether Brown****  
The community lost another icon with the passing of Monika Brown in December at the age of 91. Originally from Germany, she was a fashion model for Bogner clothing and relocated to Vail in the 1960s and had been married to filmmaker Roger Brown. ****George “Shirkie” Evans****  
Long-time restauranteur Shirkie Evans passed away in December at the age of 80. His first restaurant was Los Amigos in Vail Village. He could often be seen catering large gatherings throughout the valley for many years.
