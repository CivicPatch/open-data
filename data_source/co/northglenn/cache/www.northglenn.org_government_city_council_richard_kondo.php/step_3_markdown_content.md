Get to Know Your Council Member  
**How Long Have You Lived in Northglenn?**  
I lived my entire childhood in Northglenn until I graduated from Thornton High School and left for the Naval Academy. I have had several windows to return here, in the mid 1990s, the first half of the 2000s &amp; again from 2018 to present as a life-sciences executive.

The Kondo roots go back to the 1900s when my granddad, father and uncles were share-croppers along Riverdale Road.

**What Neighborhood/Area Do You Live In?**  
Ward 3 near old Hulstrom Elementary. I attended Hulstrom and then Northglenn Junior High School.

**What Do You Like Most About Northglenn?**  
Customer service with a personal touch, the small-town appeal and it is a well-planned community that has parks, greenway trails, retail and industrial interspersed with the residential areas.    

**What is Your Education and Career Experience?**  
Education:

- U.S. Naval Academy, B.S. Aerospace Engineering
- Navy Nuclear Propulsion Program, M.S.-equivalent in Nuclear Engineering
- University of Maryland, Asian Division, B.A. Business Administration
- Harvard Business School, MBA

Career:  
I served nearly 10 years on active duty as a Nuclear Submarine Junior officer with postings in Bremerton, WA; San Diego, CA; Pearl Harbor, HI and Yokosuka, Japan.  
In civilian life, I have had various life-science industry marketing and new business development senior executive roles with Medtronic, Boston Scientific, C.R. Bard, Alphatech Spine, Globus Medical and Becton Dickinson.  
Concurrently with my civilian career, I served in the Navy Reserves as the commanding officer/chief of staff to seven units ranging from 35 to 400 sailors in size. I retired as a captain in 2018 after nearly 30 years of service.

**How Have You Gotten Involved In the Community?**  
While hosting a Japanese home-stay student in 2018, my wife and I volunteered at the Immaculate Heart of Mary’s Food Bank and Crossroads Senior Assisted Living. Ironically, I had been in-training to fill a part-time lifeguard position when I received word about my appointment.

**Why Did You Seek This Appointment?**  
I never had any political ambition. Following the death of a family member afflicted with dementia, I wanted to channel my time and energy spent as a caregiver in a new direction.

The Naval Academy develops not only officers to lead marines and sailors, but also future leaders in private and civic arenas. That is why I submitted my name and interviewed with the City Council. As I said then, I desire to bring the arc of my education and life experiences to bear to help with the betterment of the city I grew up in.

**What Community Issues Are You Most Interested in Addressing?**  
Judicious use of taxpayer/grant monies while ensuring a strong financial position to weather economic downturns and contingencies while delivering world-class services (e.g. water, public safety, recreation, etc.) to residents with reasonable fees. 

Incumbent Questions - February 2024  
**So Far, What Achievement, Action or Work Are You Most Proud of During Your Tenure on Council?**  
I have great satisfaction in working together with my fellow dais members to better understand/appreciate key city core functions.  They include the waterworks system; the Police Department’s various training and engagement initiatives to ensure safe streets and schools; and North Metro Fire Rescue District’s (where I serve as board treasurer) emergency service capabilities.

**What is the Most Important Thing You Have Learned During Your Time on Council?**  
There are many important learnings in my 18 months as an appointed fill to Council Member Julie Duran Mullica.  One takeaway is the importance of listening to the residents; keeping an open mind; and doing my utmost to represent and speak to the plurality view of the ward.

**What Do You Feel Are The Biggest Issues That Northglenn Faces Right Now?**  
There are three focus areas for me: public safety; recapitalization of infrastructure (e.g. waterworks, streets and lights), and strong communities.  

This March (2024), council will come together to draft the next five-year strategic plan and ensuring these three areas are incorporated into this long-term framework will help address many pressing concerns.

**What is the Most Rewarding Part of Being on Council?**  
The time and energy commitment to perform this responsibility is profound - more than I had first expected.  The level of commitment I have witnessed from my fellow dais members inspires me to learn as much as I can, work hard to do justice for every vote I cast, and serve in other assigned roles (e.g. NMFRD or Denver Region Council of Governments) to the best of my ability.  Collaborating with colleagues of exceptional talent and diverse perspectives has helped me become a better public servant.
