Get to Know Your Council Member  
**How Long Have You Lived in Northglenn?**  
My family and I have lived in Northglenn for 20 years. We first bought a house near The Studio School, where our children attended elementary school, After 10 years, we moved to the west side of I-25, and into the wonderful neighborhood of Winburn Park.

**What Neighborhood/Area Do You Live In?**  
We live in the Winburn Park neighborhood, located near Charles Winburn Park - we spend a lot of time there walking our puppy on the trails around the park.

**What Do You Like Most About Northglenn?**  
There is so much to love about Northglenn!! I love our community, I love the people. I love the history and architecture of our city - the architecture of St. Stephen’s Lutheran Church, and the beautiful homes of Deza Estates. I enjoy our parks and open spaces as well as the delicious food our city has to offer!!

**What is Your Education and Career Experience?**  
I attended and graduated from Regis University with a degree in Elementary Education, and a master’s degree in Educational Leadership. I attended and graduated from the University of Colorado with a master’s degree in Culturally Linguistically Diverse Education. Over the past 20 years, I have primarily been in education. I have been a director for before and after school programming. I have been a teacher for 4th and 5th grade  students as well as have been an instructional coach for teachers. Three years ago I became an assistant principal for an amazing P-8 school, and I am enjoying every moment!!!

**Tell Us About Your Family**  
I love my family! My wife, Tina and I have enjoyed raising our family here in Northglenn. We have two children, our son is 20, and is currently pursuing a career as a firefighter. Our daughter is 16, is a junior in high school, and enjoys dance. We also have a puppy named Scout who keeps us on our toes!!!

**How Have You Gotten Involved in the Community?**  
I have been deeply involved in the community through education and the work that I have done to support students, and youth advocacy. Our family has worked hard to help make our community a better place, whether by being a good neighbor, shoveling sidewalks or picking up trash and litter along the trails. 

**Why Did You Run For Office?**  
I ran for office because I saw a need. I love our city and I knew that I would work hard for our entire community. This past summer several people in our community became concerned that my predecessor was not representing ALL. I believe in a community where ALL feel welcome, valued, and safe! I believe in a community that thrives because we can acknowledge and respect our differences. I believe in honoring the dignity that ALL people inherently have. I believe in a community that has a strong sense of belonging, a place that truly feels like home. I believe in our city, our community, a city that I love.

**What Community Issues Are You Most Interested in Addressing?**  
In my experience over the past 6 months, and in speaking with hundreds of community members, safety is a concern. Providing safe parks and open spaces, as places where families and friends can gather. Many in our community are concerned about speeding and the dangers that can bring. I am interested in addressing these concerns as they were consistently a top concern brought up by our community.

**What Regional Issues Are You Most Interested in Addressing?**  
Our community is facing many regional issues that we must take a look at and address throughout this coming year. Affordable housing, water scarcity, building density, environmental sustainability, as well as meeting the needs of unhoused individuals - these are just a few of our regional concerns, and we will need to collaborate with our neighbors and regional counterparts to provide positive outcomes.
