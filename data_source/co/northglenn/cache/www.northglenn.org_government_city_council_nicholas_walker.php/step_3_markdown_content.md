Get to Know Your Council Member  
**How Long Have You Lived in Northglenn?**  
Four wonderful years.

**What Neighborhood/Area Do You Live In?**  
Fox Run

**What Do You Like Most About Northglenn?**  
Our small-town feel and all of our open spaces/parks. I am an absolute cheerleader for the city because of some of the top-notch services our small city offers. These programs include the Access Northglenn app, which allows transparency, direct communication and follow-up from the city on resident-reported issues all in the palm of your hand.

The Gun Safe Rebate Program allows residents to purchase a safe for the proper storage of firearms and the city will help offset some of the expense.

Our small town also encourages neighborly behavior through a Block Party Trailer program that allows residents to use the city’s supplies such as tables, chairs, barricades, etc. to hold neighborly festivities.

**What is Your Education and Career Experience?**  
Bachelor of Science and Technology and a Minor in Business Administration.

**How Have You Gotten Involved In the Community?**  
I have been a part of the Snow Stormers (removing snow for veterans and the elderly or disabled), the Liquor License Authority and served as the vice chair of the Community Co-Production Policing Board.

**Why Did You Run for Office?**

- I ran for office for many reasons, but the most important is to represent the other half of Northglenn that has not had their voice heard on City Council for some time.
- Making sure that our excellent Police Department has not only the funding that they need but also the absolute support from council, which includes increasing the size of the department and increasing compensation for our brave men and women who keep us safe.
- To continue to stand against the unconstitutional vaccine mandates because “My Body, My Choice” should apply to everyone. To continue to use common sense, logic and the facts to stand against the politically-motivated mask mandate.
- Protecting 2nd Amendment rights that are under assault from not only Denver, but also Washington D.C.

**What Community Issues Are You Most Interested in Addressing?**  
Withdrawing from any mandates or guidance from the Tri-County Health Department immediately, including the mask mandate. I commend Douglas County for being brave and leaving the Tri-County Health Department as soon as the evidence mounted showing the ineffectiveness of the mandates. While I support our current decision to leave Tri-County at a later date, we need to be vigilant and make sure that former TCHD employees are not brought into the Adams County solution. We need health professionals who will use the facts.

I would also like to see real progress on our homelessness issues. These issues need to be decided by both residents and elected officials.

**What Regional Issues Are You Most Interested in Addressing?**  
It is time we improve our road infrastructure. While the N-Line is a great addition, it simply lacks any real-world viability for most of our residents. The best thing to do would be to give it another destination such as the airport without having to transfer to the A-Line.

The only project CDOT should be working on is the doubling of the size of I-25 from E-470/Northwest Parkway to C-470 near Lone Tree. I also support strict lane restrictions for commercial vehicles since our law enforcement community does not enforce the left lane laws currently. This will bring real economic aid and actual revenue to the region.
