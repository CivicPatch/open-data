## Proclamations Policy

Proclamations are historical documents that declare a day, week, or month in honor of a cause, individual, or occasion of significance to the Town of Bennett or to its residents. All proclamation requests should be made by a resident of the Town of Bennett or an organization primarily serving the Town of Bennett community.

- Support for a nationally recognized event or activity relevant to the Town.
- Bringing awareness to or recognizing a cause/non-profit organization that assists in the overall community's health and well-being (examples: Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Small Business Saturday; Domestic Violence Awareness Month, etc.).
- Recognizing an individual or group who has demonstrated an exemplary positive impact on the Town.
- Support for an art or cultural celebration within the Town.
- Support for a charitable fundraising campaign for major efforts only within the Town if the majority of the Board members present at a meeting of the Board so directs.
