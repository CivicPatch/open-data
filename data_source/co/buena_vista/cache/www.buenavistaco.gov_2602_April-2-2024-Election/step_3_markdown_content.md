# April 2, 2024 Election

**Town of Buena Vista 2024 Municipal Election**

**---**

[**View the Official Results of the April 2, 2024 Election (PDF)**](https://www.buenavistaco.gov/DocumentCenter/View/4968)

**---**

Buena Vista's municipal election will take place on April 2, 2024, to elect three Trustees to serve a four-year term of office expiring in 2028. Also, one additional Trustee position with a term expiring in 2026 is open, filling the vacancy created in 2023.

The three candidates who receive the highest votes will hold the three Four-year Trustee positions (2024 – 2028). The candidate receiving the next highest vote total will fill the position of the term expiring in 2026.

The candidates for Trustee are:

- Thomas Brown
- Maggie Huyck
- Andy Matkovich
- Andrew Rice
- Micha Rosenoer
- Devin Rowe

Also on the ballot will be two ballot questions that Town of Buena Vista electors have the option to answer either yes or no. If approved, ballot Question 2A Change Election Date would change the Town's regular municipal elections from April to November of even-numbered years to coordinate with the county election cycle. This would extend the terms of the Mayor and the current Trustees whose positions are not up for election in April 2024 to November 2026 and extend the terms of the candidates elected in April 2024 to November 2028.

**Ballot Language for Question No. 2A: Change Election Date**

Shall the Town's regular election date be changed from the first Tuesday of April in each even-numbered year to the Tuesday succeeding the first Monday of November in each even-numbered year beginning in 2026 and shall the terms of the elected officials whose terms expire in April 2026 be extended to November 2026 and whose terms expire in April 2028 be extended to November 2028 to correspond with the new regular election date?

The second question on the ballot will be Ballot Question 2B Publication of Ordinances. If approved by the voters, ordinances would published by title only and include information on accessing the entire ordinance on the Town of Buena Vista website or by contacting the Town Clerk for a copy of the document at no cost.

**Ballot Language for Question No. 2B: Publication of Ordinances**

To save the Town of Buena Vista significant publication costs, and provided the full language of ordinances is available on the Town's website, shall the Town of Buena Vista be authorized to publish its ordinances by title only, rather than publishing its ordinances in full?

**Information on receiving and returning ballots**

Ballots will be mailed to active voters within the town limits on March 11.

The Town Clerk's Office must receive your ballot by 7:00 pm on Election Day, **and you must sign the Affidavit of Voter for your ballot to count**.
