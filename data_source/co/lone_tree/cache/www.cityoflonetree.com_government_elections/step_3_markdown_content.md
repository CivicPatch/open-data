### Election Judges

The application for election judges for the May 7, 2024 election has now closed.

### Restrictions on Political Signage

Section 16-29-40 of the Lone Tree Municipal Code lists the several types of temporary signs that are prohibited, most notably, signs in the public right-of-way or on public property that are not approved or otherwise exempted may be removed by the City and discarded. Those who install such signs may be subject to a penalty in accordance with [Chapter 16 of the Municipal Code](https://library.municode.com/co/lone_tree/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=CH16ZO_ARTXXIXSIST_S16-29-40PRSI).

Political Signs are allowed on private property with the property owner’s permission, but must follow the following guidelines established in City Code:

**Maximum sign area:**  9 square feet per side

**Maximum height:**  6 feet

**Maximum Number:**  There is no limit to the number of signs per candidate or ballot issue on private property, but number may be regulated by an HOA.

**City Sign Permit Required:** No

### Political Signage in HOAs

House Bill 21-1310 broadened the freedom of expression in Colorado, requiring common interest communities (CICs) or homeowner associations (HOAs) controlled by the Colorado Common Interest Ownership Act (CCIOA). In summary, HOAs must allow the display of any noncommercial flag or sign at any time, but may still control how many signs you place, where you place them, and the size of such signage.

Specifically, Colorado law states that:

- an association shall not prohibit the display of a sign by the owner or occupant of a unit on property within the boundaries of the unit or in a window of the unit;
- the association shall not prohibit or regulate the display of window signs or yard signs on the basis of their subject matter, message, or content;
- an association may prohibit signs bearing commercial messages and establish reasonable, content-neutral sign regulations based on the number, placement, or size of the signs or related to other objective factors. See Section 38-33.3-106.5 (1)(c), C.R.S.
