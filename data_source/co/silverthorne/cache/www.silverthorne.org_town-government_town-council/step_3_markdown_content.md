### Ann-Marie Sandquist, Mayor

(970) 513-4900  
[asandquist@silverthorne.org](mailto:asandquist@silverthorne.org)

Ann-Marie is a decorated financial professional ' with numerous national accolades ' and 24 years of experience working with high-net-worth families. She firmly believes that investment management, financial, estate and tax planning must be employed together in order to maximize wealth for current and future generations.

When asked why she joined Town Council, Ann-Marie said "My dad has always said that if you don't participate then you really need to shut the heck up! One of the reasons that I love Silverthorne is because in every sense of the word, we are a community, and our growth and vibe come from the ideas, the volunteerism, the participation and the hard work of our community members. I'm proud to live here and serving on Town Council is my way of participating in our community and hopefully making it a more enjoyable place."

Ann-Marie has lived in Silverthorne for 16 years and loves being outdoors. She enjoys skiing both resorts and backcountry terrain, along with hiking, biking, paddle boarding and golfing. While she says that she is a lousy fly fisherwoman, she sure loves being on the river. Ann-Marie's favorite thing about living in Silverthorne is seeing a friend or neighbor out on a trail and also knowing that we all live in a pretty special place.

Kelly Baldwin

### ![Kelly Baldwin](https://www.silverthorne.org/home/showpublishedimage/3148/638252949353400000)

### Kelly Baldwin, Council Member

(970) 513-4900  
[kbaldwin@silverthorne.org](mailto:kbaldwin@silverthorne.org)

Kelly moved to Summit County, Colorado in 1983, after graduating from Northwest Missouri State University in Maryville Missouri.  She grew up in small farming communities in Iowa and Missouri.  Her first 6 years in Summit County, she worked for Copper Mountain Resort retail sales during the winter seasons and for the US Forest Service as a recreational compliance officer and wildfire fire-fighter during the summer seasons.

After a few years working in retail sales, Kelly secured a position with the Revenue Accounting Department at Copper Mountain Resort and began working her way up through the ranks of the accounting department.  In 1993, she became the Manager of the Copper Mountain Revenue Accounting Department.  She managed a staff of 10 seasonal employees, operating the resort Cashiering Office and producing monthly and annual operating financials for resort management.

In mid-2000, Kelly began working for the Vail Resorts Accounting Department as the Senior Manager of Lodging, HOA, Travel, and Reservations Accounting.  She managed a staff of 12-15 employees and prepared and managed both an annual operating budget and monthly forecast for her departments.  Kelly was also responsible for over 100 homeowner’s association’s full cycle accounting and 600+ homeowner accounts, managed by Vail Resorts.

Beginning in the summer of 2013, Kelly and a partner started Elevation Bookkeeping LLC, a home-based business in Silverthorne, CO; providing full-service bookkeeping and business consulting for many diverse small business clients located in Silverthorne and across Summit County. She currently owns and operates Elevation Bookkeeping.

Kelly is married, and she and her husband, Curt Krampert, have owned a home in Silverthorne, CO for 15.5 years.  Kelly’s husband, Curt, is also a small business owner in Silverthorne, which he has owned and operated since 1998.  In addition, she has been the volunteer treasurer for a homeowner’s association in Frisco where she and her husband own an investment condominium for 25 years.  She gardened at Silvana’s Community Garden for 3 years and was a volunteer on the Colorado Division of Wildlife’s “Wildlife Rescue and Transport Team” for 12 years.  Kelly has also been a member of the Silverthorne Town Council for the last 3.5 years.

Kelly believes in fiscal responsibility for the town of Silverthorne; balancing spending with town revenues and providing adequate reserves for that rainy day. She also believes in and works toward responsible, intelligent, and sustainable growth in the town limits and developing many types of workforce housing to attract a badly needed workforce base for Summit County.  She also believes in providing adequate fire protection for the citizens of Silverthorne, mitigating and managing the growing traffic problem in Silverthorne, and providing adequate open space and areas for recreation in and around Silverthorne.  She believes in and works on all these issues to make Silverthorne a unique and vibrant town for our guests, and a beautiful and comfortable place to call home for our residents.

Amy is currently focusing on being a stay at home mom and working with council. She is an accountant and will do that again once her children are a little older. Amy and her family have lived in Silverthorne for eight years and 15 years in Summit County. She wanted to join Silverthorne Town Council because she love this town and feels it is important to serve the community. As a mom that lives in a workforce local neighborhood, she wants to make sure she represent the interest and needs of the community. "Silverthorne is really growing and changing and I wanted to be part of that process," says Amy.

Amy loves winter sports and as a former competitive snowboarder she loves to get out on the mountain with her family when time allows. She also enjoys Nordic skiing and ice skating. Amy says that winter is what brought her family here, but summer is why they will never leave. Amy believes Silverthorne is one of the best places to raise a family. "We are regulars at North Pond on our paddle board, and frequent the playgrounds as well. You are also likely to see us out on the trails walking our dog."

## Council-Manager Form of Government

The Town of Silverthorne is a home rule community consisting of a council-manager form of government with power vested in an elected, seven-member Town Council. The Mayor and Town Council members act as the political head of the town. They are responsible for setting policy, approving the budget and formulating broad long-term policies that outline the Town's public function. Town Council determines the policies and laws necessary to regulate city growth and development. By adopting the town's annual budget, Town Council sets funding levels for all town services, programs and activities. The Town Council appoints a Town Manager to execute laws and administer Town Government.

The policy-making and legislative powers are vested in the Town Council, consisting of the Mayor and six council members elected at large for four-year overlapping terms. Council members are elected on the basis of the largest number of votes received, while the election of the Mayor requires a majority of all the votes cast for that position. The Town Council may take action through ordinances, resolutions and motions.

## Town Council Meetings

Town Council Meetings are held the second and fourth Wednesday of each month at 6 p.m. in the Town Council Chambers at 601 Center Circle.
