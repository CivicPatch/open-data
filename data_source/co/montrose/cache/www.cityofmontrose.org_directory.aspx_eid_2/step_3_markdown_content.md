Judy Ann is a long-time Montrose native and cares deeply about the community where she was born, worked, and raised her children, Craig and Christina.

She was a member of the Montrose City Council from April 2012 to 2020. She served two terms as mayor. During that time she was proud to be a part of the creation of the water sports park, addition of many hiking and biking trails, and acquiring additional land along the river to expand the river trail system. Trust and cooperation were gained with the Montrose Recreation District to achieve the Community Recreation Center. She was involved with the rescue and enhancement of the Black Canyon Golf Course and the Sunset Mesa baseball complex. Re-creating the City recycling program, completion of the East Oak Grove and Hillcrest street improvements, and formation of the broadband gigabit initiative were important issues. Working with the council, city staff, and the community, relationships were gained to help the community grow in a healthy manner. The results of the campaign to gain the Public Safety Sales Tax are obvious in the new state-of-the-art Police Department complex. As Mayor, the recognition of Montrose as an All America City in 2013 occurred.

Prior to being on the City Council, Judy Ann has been involved with many aspects of the Montrose community. She, and her husband Ralph, were educators in the Montrose County School district for 35 years. She was a volunteer with the Montrose Chamber of Commerce and the Montrose Public Lands – BLM and USFS. She has also been involved with the Montrose Regional Library and Friends of the Library. Judy Ann served as a board member with Uncompahgre/Com, Inc. which is a fiscal management non-profit dealing with funding for public lands projects, as well as an advisory board member for Hope West Hospice. Currently, she serves on the Airport Advisory Board (six years) and Colorado Mesa University - Montrose Advisory Committee.

Judy Ann has spent most of her life (58 years) in Montrose which has been her mother’s family home for 137 years.

Judy Ann hopes to work with the community and city to make Montrose an even better place to live, work, and play for everyone who is lucky enough to call Montrose home.
