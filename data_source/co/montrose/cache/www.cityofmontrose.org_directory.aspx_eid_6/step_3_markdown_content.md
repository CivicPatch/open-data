J. David Reed graduated from the University of Louisiana with his BA. He pursued a Juris Doctorate at South Texas Law School - Houston where he graduated magna cum laude. He is a member of the Colorado Bar Association and the State Bar of Texas. Additionally,  David was an Order of the Lytae E.E. Townes Scholar and a recipient of the American Jurisprudence Award. He has extensive experience in municipal law and has served on many boards over the years.

Following law school J. David Reed and his wife Debbie, his rock, moved to Montrose and started a family. Reed established his own law practice and served organizations, communities, businesses, and individual clients across the Western Slope, including offices in Montrose, Ridgway, and Telluride, for nearly 40 years. He continues to practice law in Montrose today and Debbie is a local realtor. 

The Reeds brought up their daughter Kate in Montrose. Kate was the youngest member ever, male or female, named to the U. S. Ski Team, traveled around the world as a World Cup athlete, and is a former U.S. National Champion in Freestyle Aerials. She is married to Brian, also a former U.S. Ski Team member and Olympic Freestyle Aerialist. Together they have two children, Ryder 9, and Landry 8 – who are keen skiers as well. Apart from being proud parents and grandparents, Debbie and David are also passionate animal lovers and have two white German Shepherds, Rio and Jacob, who keep them on their toes.

Over the years the Reeds have sought to serve their community. This has culminated in David offering his services to many impactful local organizations and has led him to serve on numerous boards including the Montrose County School District School Board, the Montrose Community Foundation Board, San Juan Healthcare Foundation, Black Canyon Boys and Girls Club, CMU Montrose Advisory Council, Chairman of the CMU Board of Trustees and former Mayor and member of City Council. Working with these organizations, their staff, and other board members has equipped David with the right tools to bring his experience and expertise to better serve our community. 

David was appointed to the Montrose City Council in 2021 after a previous council member resigned his seat. As required by the City Charter, he ran for election in 2022 to fill the unexpired term of his predecessor. He now holds the position of Mayor. He intends to continue to bring thoughtful, effective leadership to the role and pledges to continue to meet the new challenges presented with careful consideration to find solutions that will help our community continue to grow and prosper.
