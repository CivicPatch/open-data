## Responsibilities

The Town of Erie became a Home Rule municipality by a vote of the people in November 2023. After adopting the Town Charter, Erie will now be governed under the Town Council / Town Manager form of government. Under this form of government, the Town Council (one Mayor, one Mayor Pro-Tem, five Councilor Members) serves as the legislative and governing body of the Town, while the Town Manager administers the day-to-day operations of the Town. The Council is responsible for establishing Town policies and goals and has the authority to adopt codes, ordinances and resolutions as needed to conduct the business of the Town. Each Council Member is also responsible for acting as a [liaison to regional boards and commissions](https://www.erieco.gov/325/Board-Liaisons) on behalf of the Town of Erie.
