Roberta Ayala's roots may trace back to Denver, but her heart and commitment belong to Thornton, where she was raised. Her educational journey led her through the Adams County 14 school district, and she ultimately graduated from Skyview High School in the Mapleton Public Schools system.

In her adult life, Roberta has been a dedicated force for change, focusing on organizing, educating, and empowering working-class individuals and marginalized communities. Whether through her efforts in education or union organizing, Roberta has tirelessly worked to uplift people, providing them with knowledge and the empowerment needed to build resilient communities. For nearly a decade, Roberta has been a guiding force for non-traditional students, coaching and supporting them in obtaining job training and degrees that promise lasting economic and social impact for themselves, their families, and their communities.

As a perpetual learner, Roberta earned her degree in Political Science and Government from The University of Arizona Global Campus. Her academic journey also includes studies in art, labor relations, and education, along with obtaining a paralegal certification from The Metropolitan State University of Denver.

Roberta's love for the Thornton community, her home for over 35 years, extends beyond her professional endeavors. Before her role on the city council, she served as the president of TASCHO (Thornton Arts, Sciences, and Humanities Council). Her commitment to community safety is evident through her completion of the Thornton Citizens Police Academy, and she continues to contribute as a member of the Thornton Citizens Police Academy Alumni Association. Additionally, Roberta lends her voice to the Adams County Cultural Council Board, which awards SCFD (Scientific and Cultural Facilities District) grants to the broader Adams County community, and she actively supports Thornton in the Historical Preservation Advisory Group.

Beyond her civic engagements, Roberta finds joy in art, theater, film, and exploring diverse cities and cultures. She resides in the Woodglen neighborhood with her family, embodying the values of community, education, and empowerment in every aspect of her life.
