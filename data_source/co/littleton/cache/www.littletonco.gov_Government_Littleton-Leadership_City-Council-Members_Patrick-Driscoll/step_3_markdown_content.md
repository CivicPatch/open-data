## Council Member Bio

(show below)

Patrick Driscoll was elected to Littleton City Council in November 2017 for a four-year term serving District 1.

Driscoll moved to Colorado in 1985 after graduating from St. Bonaventure University with a B.A in History.  In 2000, he moved his family to Littleton where they have enjoyed many of the amenities Littleton has to offer.  His children are proud Littleton Public School graduates of Wilder Elementary School, Goddard Middle School and Heritage High School.

Since the early 1990s, Driscoll's career has revolved around the mortgage lending industry. He is a board member for the Colorado Association of Mortgage Professionals and is acting treasurer.  He is also involved with the Colorado Mortgage Lenders Association, and volunteers on the Denver Scholarship Foundation Committee.

Driscoll advocates for a strong business community, responsible fiscal management, collaboration, transparency, and the development of a comprehensive plan that will lead our city into the future.
