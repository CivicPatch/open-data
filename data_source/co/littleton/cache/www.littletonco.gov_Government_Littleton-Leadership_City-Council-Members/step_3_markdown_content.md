# City Council Members

Littleton is a home-rule municipality with a council-manager form of government. The city council makes policy for the city and approves the annual city budget. The city manager implements the council's policies and oversees day-to-day administration of the city government and its departments. The city council consists of seven members - one member for each of the [four legislative districts](https://www.littletonco.gov/Government/Littleton-Leadership/City-Council-Members/Council-District-Map), two at-large members, and the mayor. All council members are elected to 4-year, staggered terms. [General elections](https://www.littletonco.gov/Government/Departments/City-Clerk/Elections) for city council are held in odd-numbered years.
