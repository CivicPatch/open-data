# Mayor

Welcome to our community of amazing, friendly people and outdoor amenities. Whether you’re visiting Fraser as a tourist or looking to settle down here, Fraser is an excellent choice among similar destinations in Colorado.

Nowhere in Colorado will you find a place that allows you enjoy the authentic spirit of a small mountain town that has so much to offer in such proximity to Denver. As a gateway community of Grand County and with its friendly attitude to entrepreneurship, Fraser is an ideal place to for your business here as well.

With that said, whether you’re a resident or a visitor with a general question about the Town or a particular matter in mind, I encourage you to see me over a cup of coffee during my office hours at the Town Hall, most Tuesdays between 11 a.m. and Noon.

## Mayor Hours:

Tuesdays, 11AM-12PM at Fraser Town Hall, 153 Fraser Avenue. 

This is an opportunity to meet the Mayor and discuss items.

3. Long Range Town Comprehensive Plan
4. Cozens Ranch Open Space Master Plan
5. Current Litigation
