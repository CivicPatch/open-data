![Kelly Owens Headshot](https://www.townofbreckenridge.com/home/showpublishedimage/6781/637340419184600000)

## Mayor Kelly Owens (Term: 2024-2028)

Kelly grew up in Denver and, as a kid, loved camping, fishing and hiking in Breckenridge with her family. She went to The Colorado College where she studied environmental science and met her husband, Reed Owens. While at CC, Kelly studied abroad in Nepal and Tibet where they analyzed the impacts of tourism on the people and environment which was the beginning of her fascination with the study of impacts of travel industry and recreation on local communities.

After undergrad, Reed and Kelly moved to Anchorage, Alaska for a few years where she worked for URS analyzing the impacts of road construction on wetlands and other natural resources. In 2006, they returned to Colorado. She attend the University of Denver for a Masters of Science in Biology for studying nutrient cycling in soils of old growth and high alpine forests.

In 2008, the Owens moved to Breckenridge. Kelly began working at SE Group as an environmental analyst, later becoming a project manager. She worked closely with biologists and the Forest Service to analyze the impacts of ski area development. An important part of her job was working with ski areas such as Breckenridge, Keystone, Arapahoe Basin, Taos, Monarch, Vail, Copper, Beaver Creek and Heavenly to help them develop projects that minimized impacts to resources while also meeting their goals as developed recreation sites.

 In 2014, Kelly joined the Board of Directors for Little Red Schoolhouse. As a member of the board, Kelly came to appreciate how hard our childcare providers work, how knowledgeable they are, and how broad their contribution is to our community. The next year, she joined the Summit County Planning Commission after she learned they’d be working on an update to the Countywide Master Plan and a permitting program for short term rentals.

Reed and Kelly have 3 children, two attend Little Red Schoolhouse and one is at Dillon Valley Elementary. They also love their loyal boarder collie. They love living in the Wellington neighborhood and doing anything outdoors.

![Updated Carol Saade Headshot](https://www.townofbreckenridge.com/home/showpublishedimage/7328/637653245025800000)

## Carol Saade (Term: 2022-2026)

Carol Saade has lived in Breckenridge since 2010. She grew up in the DC suburbs, and both of her parents are Lebanese immigrants. Saade earned a BA in Economics from James Madison University, and, after college, lived in Geneva, Switzerland for two years and worked at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. 

Saade is one of the founding members of Mountain Dreamers and the board president. The organization has quickly grown over the last two years, providing service and voice to immigrants, a traditionally underrepresented portion of our community. Additionally, since 2016, Saade has been a mentor with CMC’s program created to provide support, guidance, and encouragement for first-generation college students.

 "I would like to lend my voice and energy to the important ongoing conversations in our town. I believe in: balancing our growth - prioritizing the quality of life of our full-time residents while maintaining a high-class experience for the visitors and second homeowners that help fuel our economy; increasing attainable housing; valuing and uplifting the immigrant perspective; looking ahead to major infrastructure improvements; working to decrease traffic congestion; continuing to de-stigmatize and prioritize mental health; continuing to work towards our sustainability goals; and preserving a Breckenridge that our future generations will be proud to call home," comments Saade.

## Jay Beckerman (Term: 2022-2026)

During the over two decades Jay Beckerman has lived in Breckenridge he has made good use of his time.  He married, began raising a family, owned and operated several restaurants, while still finding time to give back to the community he loves.  

Jay grew up in New England just a train ride from Yankees Stadium.  He moved out west to attend the Leads School of Business at the University of Colorado.  He came to Colorado for the education but stayed to make a difference.  When he graduated from college in 2001, he moved to Breckenridge to operate Blue River Bistro.  In 2002, he co-founded the Summit Lacrosse Program, which introduced the sport of lacrosse to summit county youth.  This led to starting a club high school team that soon became a CHSAA certified varsity program, which continues today. 

He continued public service by joining the Breckenridge Tourism Office in 2015 and currently serves as the treasurer.  In 2016, he was asked to join the Upper Blue Planning Commission and now is the representative on the County Wide Planning Commission.  Jay also serves as Chairman on the Town of Breckenridge Planning Commission.  In a desire to be a part of his children’s education, he volunteered to serve on the Summit School District Finance Committee.  Lastly, he volunteers on his neighborhood HOA and is currently the treasurer.   

Jay has had multiple restaurants over the last twenty years, but Blue River Bistro has been a staple in Breckenridge.  Recently, he and his team opened Bistro North in Dillon.  Through his two scratch kitchens he is able to support other summit county local businesses by sourcing local olive oil, salts, vinegars, honey, coffee, tea, ice cream and beef. When it comes to supporting a community that has been so good to him and family Jay lives by the credo ‘If you can you should’ his businesses have been consistent financial supporters of organizations such as FIRC, Summit Foundation, NRO, Team Breck, High Country Conservation Center and Timberline Learning Center. 

Jay is married to a local family physician, Erin, and has two daughters who attend Dillon Valley Elementary.  As his children would say, their dad can be found “getting his wiggles out” every morning downhill skiing, alpine touring, mountain biking, hiking or at the recreation center

## Todd Rankin (Term: 2022-2026)

Giving back to this wonderful town is important to me.  I have been a member of the Summit County Open Space Advisory Council since February 2013 and Vice Chair since 2019.  I am also a member of the governor appointed 5th Judicial District Nominating Commission since 2016.  I am thankful to be the Chair of the Breckenridge Events Committee since 2018.  Being the Chair of the Isak Heartstone Troll Committee to move the troll out of the Wellington was also a challenging, fun and rewarding experience. 

My wife, Barb, and I are passionate about our community, and we proudly support the Summit Foundation, the Breckenridge Outdoor Education Center, the FIRC, SkatesGiving.com, Summit Youth Hockey, and other local charities. 

We founded SkatesGiving which has raised almost $100k in the past 3 years to provide free kids hockey for kids under 8 in Summit County.  It has also provided scholarships and equipment for older kids in the program.

Prior to arriving in the mountains, I graduated with a degree in Economics from the University of Virginia and then served in the Air Force for 5 years, earning my MBA at night. I then spent 6 years doing Business Development in Northern Virginia, Tokyo, Japan and Seattle, Washington working on South America and Asia.  Having lived in Pennsylvania, Germany, Virginia, New Mexico, Boston, D.C., Tokyo, traveling for a year and finally moving to Summit County in 2005, I feel like I am finally "home."

I have sold real estate in the mountains for almost 15 years and started and run a successful real estate brokerage firm for almost 13 years. In addition to real estate sales, we own and manage multiple long-term rentals in Summit County.  My real estate expertise encompasses sales (including selling the 214 unit deed restricted Smith Ranch project in Silverthorne), development, long-term rentals, short-term rentals and hundreds of hours evaluating parcels for acquisition by the Summit County and Breckenridge Open Space programs.

When not working, I am a big fan of wandering mountain bike rides in the Golden Horseshoe, taking a lap around Mt. Guyot, ski touring from the Laurium, playing hockey and lingering at the Grace.

## Marika Page (Term: 2024-2028)

Marika Page has lived in Breckenridge since 2008.  She is a licensed social worker, and works full time as the social worker for the public defender’s office in the 5th judicial district.  Becoming a social worker was a career change for Marika, who earned her master’s in social work remotely from the University of Denver in August 2023.  While a master’s student, she completed a one- year internship as a social worker with the Summit School District, and a second internship with the public defender, who then created a full-time position for her.

She has been a Town of Breckenridge employee from 2009-2017, and 2021-2024, in part time (guest service and personal training) and full time (Fitness and Facility Coordinator and Fitness and Nordic Coordinator) positions.  

She is also the High Performance Coach for Team Summit’s Nordic program.

Marika moved to Breckenridge intending to make it her forever home.  Originally living at the Breckenridge Nordic Center as the full-time caretaker, she eventually purchased a workforce housing unit in Vic’s Landing, where she served as the HOA president for three years. She helped resurrect the Frisco Rowing Center on Lake Dillon, bringing athletes from all over the world to train at altitude, as well as developing a local community of rowers, many of whom learned to row from her on Lake Dillon.  Marika is a certified mediator in Colorado, and served as a volunteer mediator in Summit county small claims court.

Marika’s expertise is in understanding that the same story has many perspectives, and individuals understand the story differently, based on their needs, interests and experiences.  Marika believes the Town is a unique place to live and a special place to visit, and we need the perspectives and contributions of all our residents to sustainably balance our growth and our natural environment.

## Steve Gerard (Term: 2024-2028)

I ran for a seat on Town Council because I want to preserve the historic appeal of our incomparable mountain town, protect and enhance its livability for our local families, and provide for a sustainable work force.

I bring my understanding of the Development Code and Historic Design Standards, gained from serving for seven years as a Planning Commissioner, along with my ability to listen to all sides learned from my experience with the Iowa Judicial Branch and mediation training, to making the critical development decisions necessary to achieve these goals. My degree in accounting provides an understanding of the budgeting process and financial issues confronting the town.

I support strong rules for historic preservation to protect our historic properties, and thoughtful, sustainable development. I believe in carefully considering issues and will focus on their impact through a locals-first lens. 

I consider myself a local, along with my wife and daughter, each of us living and working as part of the community in this town. While we are home to the world-class Breckenridge Ski Resort, it is the people who live and work here that make this community exceptional and who I wish to represent.

I have been a been a property owner in Breckenridge for over 20 years and a full-time resident for eight. I have worked for the Breckenridge Golf Course and in ticket sales for Vail Resorts, gaining invaluable knowledge of local businesses and the Breckenridge work force. 

I am presently employed by the State of Colorado as a contract attorney representing children and indigent parents in juvenile court. I work in Summit County and several adjoining mountain counties giving me a big picture understanding of the challenges and issues faced by governments across Colorado.

When not working you can find me hiking our local trails, Nordic skiing in the winter, and enjoying group fitness classes year-round at the Breckenridge Recreation Center.
