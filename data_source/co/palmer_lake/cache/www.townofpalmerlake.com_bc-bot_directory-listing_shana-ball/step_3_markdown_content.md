Profile

Elected:  2022 for a four-year term

Shana was born in Palmer Lake and, after high school, returned to reside in the town full-time.

Shana first served as a volunteer firefighter/EMT with the Town Fire department, then became a paid responder. She volunteered as an Officer of the Fire department – Lt., Capt., and the Chief. From 2012 to 2014, Shana also served on the Board of Trustees and in 2020, she was appointed to serve with the Planning Commission. Shana is actively involved in writing grants for the town and currently serving on the Board for the El Paso - Teller 911 Authority.

Shana holds a BA in nursing and emergency management and intends to continue education in these areas to, one day, receive a Doctorate. Working in the nursing/emergency services field for about 30 years, Shana currently runs an Assisted Living Residence in her home, a business she hopes to expand in the future.  Shana has two daughters, both married, living in Colorado and helping with her assisted living residence. She has one son who lives at home and five grandchildren. In her spare time, Shana enjoys hiking our beautiful trails, kayaking, reading, catching up with friends, and teaching her ducks to be great companions to her elderly residents.  Shana has a strong passion for the town, emergency services and caring for the elderly. She is an avid animal lover, raised with strong Christian values, a strong work ethic, and a responsibility to give back. She works to live up to those standards and pass those beliefs on to her own children and grandchildren.  

Shana can be reached by the town email noted below.

**Term End Date:** Thursday, December 10, 2026
