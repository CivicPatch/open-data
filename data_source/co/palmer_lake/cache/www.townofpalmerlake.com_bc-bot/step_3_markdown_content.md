# Board of Trustees

The Town of Palmer Lake is a statutory town and governed by an elected seven member Board, all volunteers, including the Town Mayor and six Trustees. The Mayor has a two-year term and Trustees serve for four years. Members are elected in coordination with the El Paso County November General Election, in even-numbered years. 

The Board of Trustees is the legislative body of the Town of Palmer Lake and holds regular meetings on the 2nd and 4th Thursday each month at 6 PM to consider and act on Town business. Regular meetings require a quorum of members and minutes of the proceeding. Board meetings are available to the public via "Live Stream" (from the ribbon at the top of the town web page). *Public comment is welcomed via email,* [*info@palmer-lake.org*](mailto:info@palmer-lake.org) *and will be distributed to the Board.* The Board may require an Executive Session on the agenda. This is confidential information pursuant to Colorado law. No action is taken by the Board in Executive Session.

On occasion, the Board may schedule a workshop, which is intended for deeper discussion on one topic and engage public or staff feedback. A workshop does not require a quorum of members and no official action is taken at a workshop; therefore, minutes of the proceeding are not required. This is an active time of Board and public (or other) discussion. Workshops are available to the public via "Live Stream" from the town web page.

Additionally, the Board may schedule a retreat time for members to participate in training, discussion of long-term planning, strategic goals or other Board business such as meeting rules. Retreats do not require a quorum of members, do not allow official action and do not require minutes of the proceeding.  Retreats are not available by live stream.

Though all of these types of meetings are appropriately noticed and open to the public, workshops and retreats may have limited public interaction depending on the Board discretion of the scheduled topic and time.

In October 2021, the Board of Trustees passed a Resolution declaring this mission for the Town:  

***To provide leadership to preserve our small community dynamic with measured and sustainable growth in partnership with the citizens of the town of Palmer Lake including the following vision -***

- ***To serve the community to meet fundamental needs while respecting the diversity and values of our citizens;***
- ***To foster trust through effective communication, transparency, and partnership with the community; and***
- ***To develop sustainable, durable revenue streams to assure Palmer Lake’s future.***

In February 2025, the Board of Trustees adopted a Resolution amending the Town mission, as follows:    

***The Town Board of Trustees hereby declares their mission is to provide leadership to preserve our community dynamic with thoughtful growth in partnership with the citizens of the town of Palmer Lake.*** 

- ***Serving the community to provide public services and safety while respecting the diversity and values of our citizens.***
- ***Maintaining trust through effective communication, transparency, and partnership with the community.***
- ***To support a healthy economic environment to assure Palmer Lake’s future.***
