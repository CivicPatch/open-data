## About Heidi Henkel

Office Hours:  Weekly on Tuesdays 10 am - 1 pm by request via email.  Additional time is available by request.

I was born and raised in Colorado, from Parker and Niwot, and I’ve been serving Broomfield since 2007. After attending Baylor University, and graduating with a B.S. in Biological Studies and a secondary teaching certification from Colorado State University, I worked as a high school math and science teacher in various states with my husband, Scott, while he served in the 82nd Airborne and was an Aide de Camp to General Urias. After Scott served in Afghanistan in 2007, we decided to put our roots down in Broomfield, while I opened my own math tutoring business and worked as the Communications Director at a local church. We have raised our two children, Connor and Emee, in Broomfield and are so grateful we made the decision to raise them in this community that has given us so much. Connor attended Holy Family High School and now is studying to become a physical therapist at the University of Jamestown, while playing NAIA football and running track. Emee is a freshman at Legacy High School, is a competitive swimmer, and interned at a Veterinary clinic in Ward 5. 

How Heidi has been engaged in Broomfield and beyond: 

I am deeply involved in my community and I understand the challenges that Broomfield faces. I currently serve as the director of the Broomfield Resettlement Task Force which assists with resettling refugees from Ukraine and Afghanistan in Broomfield. This work, alongside our all-volunteer team, earned the Heart of Broomfield Angel Award in 2022.

Additionally, I have been serving on the following boards:

- Broomfield Area Chamber of Commerce
- Broomfield Sister Cities (Current sister city is Ueda, Japan)
- NACO Presidential Appointment to the Federal Immigration Task Force
- Metro Area County Commissioners
- CSBG Tripartite Board- We work on keeping those on fixed and/or low incomes housed and preventing homelessness.  
  Colorado Communities for Climate Action
- Early Childhood Council

I have also volunteered to assist women in domestic violence situations to complete their GED’s and served as a volunteer math tutor at Westlake Middle School.

I was re-elected to Broomfield’s Ward 5 City Council in 2023 and I am humbled at the opportunity to continue my work listening to, representing, and bettering my community. I am a strong advocate for affordability, safety, and being fiscally responsible. During the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, I helped ensure increased vaccine access and helped local businesses reopen safely. Local businesses are the backbone of the community and the key to economic vitality. I am proud to use my office to advocate for fiscal and environmental sustainability, affordability, diversity, safety and police department support, mental health services, and government transparency.
