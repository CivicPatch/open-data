# Mayor &amp; Board of Trustees

![2024 Board of Trustees Group Photo](https://columbinevalley.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GroupBOT2024-scaled.jpg)

The Columbine Valley Board of Trustees has six members elected at-large to four-year terms. The Mayor, also elected at-large, governs for a two-year term.

The Town Board serves as the community’s legislative body, taking action through the enactment of ordinances, resolutions and adoption of an annual budget, which provide direction for the Town Staff to follow. The Board appoints a Town Administrator, Town Marshall, Attorney, Treasurer, and Municipal Judge.

Term expirations are staggered and elections for Trustees are held in April of even numbered years. After each election, the Board elects a Mayor Pro Tem from among themselves. In the absence of the Mayor, the Mayor Pro Tem shall perform the duties of Mayor.
