Trevor holds a Master’s in Business Administration (MBA) with an emphasis in Human Resource Management and Marketing. He is an Idaho Hunter’s Education and Idaho Bow Hunter’s Education Instructor and was named the 2014 Regional Instructor of the Year. Trevor is the co-founder of the Youth Hunters of America, an organization that provides free hunting opportunities to kids in our community. He was also the President of West Valley Little League for over eight years and served as the assistant baseball coach at Cole Valley Christian High School.

Trevor and Amber have been married for 27+ years and have four children. All of their children attended Star Elementary.
