# Jim Freeman

 

[City Council](https://www.idahofallsidaho.gov/Directory.aspx?DID=53)  
Title: Council Member  
Phone: (208) 360-1471  
[Email](mailto:jfreeman@idahofalls.gov)

Jim Freeman was born and raised in Idaho Falls and grew up in the numbered streets.  As a child growing up his father and grandfather both served on the City Council. This was the impetus that started his interest in civic service. Jim attended Idaho Falls High School and the University of Idaho.  At this time he met his wife Kareen and they have now been married 35 years.

Jim and Kareen chose to return to Idaho Falls in the early 1980’s and start a family.   They have raised two wonderful sons, have two lovely daughters-in-law and three adorable and energetic grandsons.  

They love living in Idaho Falls and leading an active lifestyle, enjoying the many opportunities that exist here.

Jim was lucky enough to find his true calling when he joined the Idaho Falls Fire Department in 1986. For 26 years he served as a firefighter, paramedic and Captain with the IFFD.  He attended the National Fire Academy and served on the Executive Board of Firefighters Local 1565.  

Since retirement in 2012, Jim has been involved in civic service and volunteering in his free time.  He recently served on the Mayor’s Citizen Review Committee for Parks and Recreation and has also served on the Golf Advisory Board.  His public service includes volunteering for Blazing a Trail for Literacy, Relay for Life, Idaho Falls Men's Golf Association and as a coach for Idaho Falls Youth Hockey, Little League Baseball and AYSO soccer.

Jim is proud to call Idaho Falls home and is grateful for the opportunity to further serve the citizens of this great community.
