Hi! I’m Carter Stanford. I’m 21 years old and have lived in Sugar City my whole life. I will be graduating at the end of the year from BYU-I with my Bachelors in Marketing and a minor in Business. I have always had an interest in government and politics, so I was really excited when I learned I had won the election and would have the opportunity to serve the people of this community on city council. A few of my personal interests are cooking, traveling, sports, and spending time with my wife and our dog. I am committed to making a positive impact through my work on city council and I strive to ensure that Sugar City remains a wonderful place to live, work, and play for generations to come.
