# Joy Ball

[Council Member Highlights](https://sugarcityidaho.gov/category/council-member-highlights)

![](https://sugarcityidaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/joy-ball.png)

I was born at Madison Memorial in Rexburg (one of the first sets of twins born there), to Darrell and Verla Moss, and raised in Sugar City.  The first 6 years I lived on a small farm on the Teton highway, along with my  four older siblings and a younger sister who joined us later.  My parents bought a house on North Austin Avenue, and we moved into town.  I graduated from Sugar Salem High School, Ricks College and Brigham Young University.  After serving an LDS mission to New Zealand I started teaching, one year at Hibbard Elementary, 33 years at Central Elementary, and three semesters at BYU-Idaho.  I presently tutor children in a home business (J &amp; J Tutoring), and have a second home business (Joy’s Joys), where I make and sell cuddly soft minky blankets.  I married a local man, Gerald Ball, in 1981, and we were blessed with two children and four (almost 5) grandchildren.  Gerald passed away in 2004.  I love and care about this community, and desire for us to grow responsibly and plan carefully for our future.
