mayor’s office

# Office of the **Mayor**

Welcome to the City of Chubbuck, Office of the Mayor. As the head of the city, the mayor’s office is a hub of activity and responsibility. The mayor speaks for both the government and the community as a whole. In addition the mayor is responsible for overseeing the operations of the city by working with the officials of each city department. The mayor is involved in long-term planning and helps each department ensure they are working towards their goals.

A great highlight for the mayor is the State of the City address. The mayor can deliver a progress report on the city directly to residents on the success of our humble little town.

The mayor also works with city officials and administrators to complete a budget for the city. They mayor must ensure all funds are allocated properly for each department. The mayor monitors the budget and adjusts it as needs arise within different sectors of our local government.
