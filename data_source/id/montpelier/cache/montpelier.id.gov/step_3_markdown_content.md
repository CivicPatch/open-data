Water WE Drink CCR Report

**Montpelier has a rich history and is part of Bear Lake County in Southeastern Idaho. Mormon Pioneers first put Montpelier on the map when they came to settle the area; their hardy perseverance paved the way for the residents that live here today. The city became a stop on the Oregon Trail and has since hosted robust farmers and ranchers, the railroad, phosphate mines, and other forms of industry.**

**The town of approximately 2500 people retains its small-town feel while providing many valuable and enriching opportunities and experiences. The outdoors-hunting, fishing, skiing, snow machining, camping, hiking and many more opportunities lie within just minutes of the city, including beautiful Bear Lake. There is something here for everyone! U.S. Routes 89 and 30 intersect in Montpelier, and many travelers enjoy stopping to take in the museums, eat delicious food, or experience any of the many activities that take place throughout the year. Montpelier is a wonderful place to visit and a great place to live! Come see us!**

**Today the city is overseen by Mayor Theodore Slivinski, and a six-member city council. Council members include Dan Fisher, Bobbi Leonhardt, Shane Johnson, Ray Henrie, Brady Shultis, and Quinton Pope. The council is focused on listening to the needs of the public and meet the first and third Wednesday evenings of each month at 7:30 P.M. to address the business of the city and its residents.**
