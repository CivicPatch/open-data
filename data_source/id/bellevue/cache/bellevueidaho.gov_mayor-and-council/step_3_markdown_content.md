# Bellevue Mayor and Council

### Elected Representation

“We hold these truths to be [self-evident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-evident "Self-evident"), that [all men are created equal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_men_are_created_equal "All men are created equal"), that they are endowed by their [Creator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creator_deity "Creator deity") with certain [unalienable Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inalienable_rights "Inalienable rights"), that among these are [Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life,_liberty_and_the_pursuit_of_happiness "Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness").—That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the [consent of the governed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent_of_the_governed "Consent of the governed"),—”

**And so begins the Preamble of the United States Declaration of Independence to so clearly establish that Governments exist to act to secure the unalienable Rights of those who elected them.**

# Bellevue Government

Our Government Mayor City Council

## **Our Government**

The City of Bellevue operates under the Mayor-Council form of government. This system of government is based on the separation of powers and a recognition of a need for checks and balances.

There is a division of responsibility so that each branch of government (Executive-Legislative) depends upon the other and no one branch dominates or monopolizes power.

## **Mayor – Executive Branch**

The Mayor of Bellevue is elected by the City residents and serves a two-year term. The Mayor serves as the chief administrative official of the City and is responsible for implementing and administering laws and policies adopted by the City Council (Legislative Branch), as well as managing government operations. 

In addition, the Mayor develops policy recommendations for the Council and nominates individuals to serve in appointed offices, permanent City boards, commissions and committees subject to confirmation by a majority of the City Council. The Mayor presides over City Council meetings, determines the order of business and votes, when required, to break a tie vote of the City Council.

## **City Council – Legislative Branch**

The City Council is made is made up of six representatives elected by the City residents and who serve two-year terms. The Council is responsible for passing laws and policies, setting a budget and appropriating money to fund government operations. In addition, the Council adopts the City’s comprehensive plan, which serves as the City’s plan for future growth and development, as well as urban renewal plans.
