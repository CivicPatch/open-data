# Mayor and Council

The city is governed by a Mayor and six (6) Council Members, each is elected to a four year term. Council Members run for one (1) of six (6 ) positions. The positions are not tied to precincts or certain areas of the city but when running for office the candidates must declare which seat they intend to fill. This type of election means that the candidates are actually running against one another for a particular seat on the council, rather than candidates with the most votes automatically winning a seat as is done in most cities throughout Idaho. In order to maintain a certain amount of continuity on the council, the terms of each position are staggered so that no more than 4 council seats and the Mayor’s seat are contested in the same election year.
