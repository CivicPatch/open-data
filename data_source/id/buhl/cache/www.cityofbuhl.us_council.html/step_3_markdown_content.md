​Hello, my name is Marla Sisson, and I am your City Council President. For those that don’t know me, let me introduce myself.  I graduated magna cum laude in 2007, from Eastern Michigan University with a bachelor’s degree in teaching. Very soon after graduating, I moved to Boise to teach in the public schools. In 2016, I met the love of my life, RC Sisson, and have two wonderful children together. Though we were living in Boise, we found ourselves visiting family in Buhl more often. When our oldest was only a few months old, we decided the best place to raise our family was in Buhl to be closer to family. As soon as we moved, my husband started Sisson Accounting in Buhl. That opportunity allowed me to stay home with our children. Now that they are older, I help more with our growing family business. We feel so fortunate to live in community of history. Through my experiences on the council and volunteering my time, I feel very connected to our community and enjoy being an active member.   
   
I have served for three years on the council and strive to work together to continue to make Buhl a place to be proud of. I have been a rational, conservative voice for our town and carry no political agenda. I advocate for smart planning and most importantly, fiscal responsibility. I enjoy being an active member of our community and believe it is vital to have the input of its citizens. I encourage you to attend our meetings and get involved.
