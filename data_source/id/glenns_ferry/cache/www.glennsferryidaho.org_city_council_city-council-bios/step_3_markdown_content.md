## Susan Case

![](https://glennsferryidaho.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/9750-COUNCIL-SUSAN-1-230x300.jpg)

I came  
I saw  
I made it awkward  
I asked a lot of questions  
Found a way to get stuff done in spite of the awkwardness

Today I am me  
That’s as true as can be  
There is no one alive  
That is Me’er than me

I was born  
Someday I’ll die  
In between, there’ll be a lot of work and an equal amount of laughter and the hope I leave this world a better place ‘cause I tried very hard to always do right.

There’s a road to normal and a winding path to peculiar, guess which one will lead you to me.

All kidding aside, I’ve lived in, worked in, volunteered in and loved Glenns Ferry for 25 years. The council position is a service position and I want nothing more than to see Glenns Ferry reach its full potential.  I was humbled to be voted in and do not take that trust in me lightly.

## Steven Alderman

I’m excited to get the chance to represent the people of Glenns Ferry on future decisions concerning each and every one of us and the future of our small town.

I moved to Glenns Ferry at age 4 and was a proud Pilot.  I grew up working in various businesses around town and spent summers moving pipe, building houses and working at Hanson’s Café, which helped keep me in shape for football season.  At any given time, I held down two or three jobs so I could buy myself a nice bike or cool car.   I graduated from Glenns Ferry High in 1989 and moved away to make my mark on the world.  I attended Boise State University and was a proud member of the BSU football program.  Post college, I became an entrepreneur and formed Creekside Tile, becoming a successful tile contractor in Boise and the surrounding area for 30 years.   In addition to the tile business, I also had an amazing run in the Media/Videography business, Creekside Media.  I won multiple awards for wildlife-outdoor videos and TV commercials.

I married my wife, Amy, in 2000 and in 2003 we welcomed our son Bennett into the world.  I have been an active outdoorsman and hunter throughout my life and have logged hundreds of volunteer hours into conservation projects/organizations to promote healthy wildlife.  Participating on the Boards of many local and national wildlife organizations has given me the insight needed to take the fight for the good of Glenns Ferry to the next level.

In 2018, I made the move returning to Glenns Ferry to invest in the community.  Since that time, I have been tirelessly working to promote, renew and revitalize our small town.  My goal for becoming a City Councilman is part of my effort to promote healthy growth and improvement to our beloved GF.   I promise to keep each one of you in mind when working through the kinks to make this town amazing again, tapping into tourism, promoting small business and improving the infrastructure.

## David Payne

I was born in Farmington, New Mexico, and spent my early years in the Southwest where my father worked various jobs and also raised cotton. At 6 years old, my family moved to Yuba City, California, where I graduated from Yuba City High School in 1969. I served a two-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Southeast Mexico, headquartered in Veracruz. I grew to love the Mexican people and when I returned, I attended Yuba Community College and then Brigham Young University. I graduated cum laude from BYU with a BA in Spanish. I was a distinguished graduate from the BYU Air Force ROTC program and completed a 21-year career in the Air Force as an aircraft navigator, staff officer and U-2 high altitude reconnaissance mission planner. I served as a deputy sheriff in Yuba County, California for two years, working in their jail and superior court. After a year with the US State Department and the Colombian National Police in their Colombian counternarcotics program, I filled a position as a Lockheed Martin contractor with the US Air Force in Kuwait for a year, then at Beale AFB, California, for five years. In 2006 we bought a house in Glenns Ferry and moved here in 2008. Since moving to this community, we have been very active in community affairs. I have been the VFW Post 3646 Adjutant since 2009 and have served as President of the Glenns Ferry Chamber of Commerce and on the board for several years. I have worked as a volunteer with economic development in the area for over 14 years. For the past seven years, my wife and I have volunteered with the International Children’s Surgical Foundation (ICSF), traveling to Central and South America many times to help with various tasks with the surgical team. We have also served as the ICSF Office Administrators since 2017. We have thought about retiring but are just too busy to retire.

My wife, Annette, and I have 8 children and 18 grandchildren. As you might expect from a military family, our family is scattered all over the United States—from California to Montana, Colorado, Texas, Utah, Florida and Pennsylvania.

It has been and is a distinct privilege to serve this community, where we have chosen to live.

## Jordan Thomas

I was born and raised in the small town of Lewisville, Idaho with 500 residents.  I grew up milking cows, watering potatoes with siphon tubes and raising cattle.  I attended and graduated from Rigby High School where I was actively involved in FFA and varsity wrestling.  I worked construction between high school and college traveling to West Yellowstone, Jackson Hole, and living and working in Star Valley, Wyoming for 5 years building houses and commercial buildings.  I attended and graduated from BYU-I with degrees in Agronomy, Animal Science, and Farm Business.  While in College I was chosen to be a National Vice President in the Post Secondary Agriculture Association (PAS) and was able to travel and promote Ag Business Studies throughout the country.

I met my wife Sarah when we were kids, and after many years of interest she said yes.  We will be celebrating 20 years of marriage in December.  We have 8 children ranging from 4-17 years old.  We have lived and worked in Idaho, Nevada, and New Mexico, always involved in agriculture.  I have served on past State and National Potato Boards and am currently serving on Potatoes USA National Board.  In my free time I volunteer with the Glenns Ferry Wrestling Programs and golf when given a chance.

We moved to Glenns Ferry in 2021 and lived in the Redford Motel for 6 months before finding and purchasing a home on Garfield Avenue.  We try to stay active and involved in community activities and spend a fair amount of time serving in our local church congregation.  Our kids keep us hopping with their involvement in wrestling, softball, baseball, basketball, and living at the Rec pool during the summertime.

I am honored to have been voted onto the city council by the residents of Glenns Ferry. At this time, I understand the water and road infrastructure is critical for continued growth and sustainability in our town. My desire is to make my time on the city council as productive as possible and will strive for solutions that will benefit us all.
