## Announcements

### Road Grant Awarded

The City of Firth was successful in a second application to LHTAC (Local Highway Technical Assistance Council) and awarded a grant to replace the road on Roosevelt St. and add a sidewalk &amp; gutter. It is anticipated that the road will be very similar to the work done recently on Lincoln Street. We do not yet know when construction will start but are very excited to improve another road in town.

### [Blue Cross of Idaho - 2nd grant](https://www.bcidahofoundation.org/16-idaho-cities-to-attend-community-health-academy)

After completing Blue Cross's Communitty Health Academy, and receiving a $20,000 grant for community improvements, Mayor Jolley applied for a second grant with Blue Cross of Idaho. This grant was only open to city's that completed the Health Academy. The city was awarded another $20,000 grant. This grant will be used to develop and update the city's comprehensive plan.
