### Mayor John EvansÂ ![](https://gardencityidaho.org/vertical/Sites/%7BA16794C5-94AE-4C54-B8E9-ADC537012C3F%7D/uploads/Evans_John.jpg)

John Evans grew up and was educated in the Midwest.Â  A Vietnam veteran, John and his wife, Judy, were married in 1969 and have three grown children, twelve grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.Â  John and Judy moved their family to Idaho in 1975 and then to Garden City in 1988.

Since he arrived in Idaho, John has been primarily involved in the construction industry.Â  Since 1985 John has been in the residential real estate development business in Ada and Canyon Counties.Â  His current project is in Caldwell.Â  John has not engaged in any business activity in Garden City since his election to the city council in 1995.

Before he was elected Mayor in November of 2005, John served on the Garden City Planning &amp; Zoning Commission from 1992-1995 and served on the Garden City city council from 1996-2005.Â  While on the City Council, John served several one-year terms as President of the City Council, Council liaison to the GardenÂ City Police Department, and Council liaison to the Library Board, a position he held for ten years.Â  He also performed the council oversight function for the construction of the Police Department building in 1999 and the new City Hall/Library building in 2004.Â  John also serves on the boards of the Community Planning Association (COMPASS), Valley Regional Transit (VRT), the Idaho Counties Risk Management Program (ICRMP) Board, and serves as a Fourth Judicial District Magistrate Commission member.Â 

John and Judy enjoy hanging out with family and traveling to the coast and other points around the northwest.Â  When time permits, John enjoys cowboy action shooting.Â

### Council President James Page

Growing up in a military family, James has called many places home. After his fatherâ€™s military career ended, Jamesâ€™s family moved to Caldwell and then later to Meridian. James has called Western Idaho his home since 1985.

James earned a Bachelor of Arts in Criminal Justice at Boise State University and his Juris Doctor from Concordia University School of Law. He is a proud member of the Idaho Bar. Jamesâ€™s career began at the [Idaho Department of Correction](https://www.idoc.idaho.gov) and later at the [Idaho Commission of Pardons &amp; Parole](https://parole.idaho.gov). In those capacities, he learned the value of service and government accountability. James left government employment in 2003 to launch his business, providing legal services to government agencies and their partners.

James, his wife Tessie, and their children moved to Garden City in 2007. Whenever James is asked why he moved his family to Garden City, James points to the Boise River, miles of greenbelt, amazing restaurants, the craft beverage corridor, economic diversity, an eclectic mix of residents, and a vibrant sense of identity and community.

In 2014, Mayor John Evans appointed James to the Garden City Planning and Zoning Commission. In that capacity, James navigated the delicate zoning balance that sustains Garden Cityâ€™s robust business interests, artist spaces, and residential communities. His love of land use and planning prompted James to accept Mayor Evans's appointment to the City Council in August 2019. Garden City voters elected James to retain his Council seat in 2019 and again in 2023.

Teresa is an Idaho native and moved to Garden City in 2011.Â In 2007Â Teresa began her career in the photocopier industry. Previous work experience included 17 yearsÂ in the semiconductor industry. She hasÂ volunteered with various organizations in the communityÂ andÂ most recentlyÂ servesÂ on the Board of Directors for Lakeland Village Homeowners Association.Â 

TeresaÂ was selected as one of theÂ [Idaho Business Review's Women of the Year in 201](https://idahobusinessreview.com/2011/01/04/idaho-business-review-selects-50-leading-idaho-women-one-%E2%80%98woman-of-the-year%E2%80%99)[0](https://idahobusinessreview.com/2011/01/04/idaho-business-review-selects-50-leading-idaho-women-one-%E2%80%98woman-of-the-year%E2%80%99).Â This award recognizes Idaho women whose successes in business and contributions to the community have set the pace for our regionâ€™s future.Â In 2017Â Teresa wasÂ recognized by theÂ [WCAâ€™s Tribute to Women in Industry](https://www.wcaboise.org/2017-wca-twin). Â 

InÂ SeptemberÂ 2020, Mayor EvansÂ appointedÂ TeresaÂ to complete the remainingÂ termÂ of CouncilmemberÂ Elfreda Higginsâ€™Â term after herÂ resignation.

Teresa likes to spendÂ her leisure time traveling,Â sailing,Â hiking in the foothills, andÂ walkingÂ the Greenbelt.Â TeresaÂ hasÂ three children andÂ two fur babies.

### ![](https://gardencityidaho.org/vertical/Sites/%7BA16794C5-94AE-4C54-B8E9-ADC537012C3F%7D/uploads/Rasmussen_Kent.jpg)Council Member Kent Rasmussen

Rasmussen has spent most of his career years in wholesale and retail development for Hallmark Cards. Complementing this core experience are two notable periods in wine wholesaling and retailing, the latter of which is his current role at Albertsons.Â  Throughout his tenure with Hallmark, which commenced in Boise in 1997, Rasmussen and his family relocated multiple times to Seattle, Dallas, Kansas City, and Cincinnati metro areas.Â  In 2017, the chance to return to the Treasure Valley presented itself prompting him and his wife to choose Garden City for its appealing proximity to a wide array of amenities within the entire region.

For much of his career, he focused on market development and retail site analysis, leading to a broader interest in land use.Â Â That experience led to his appointment by Mayor Evans to Garden Cityâ€™s Planning and Zoning Commission in 2019 where he served as Chairman from 2022 until his installation as a city council member in January 2024.

Rasmussen takes great pride in championing youth sports, particularly contributing to the growth of water polo.Â  His involvement spanned coaching summer club teams, previously serving as the head coach for both boys and girls teams at an Ohio High School, and actively participated as a referee.

Kent and his wife Bonnie have been happily married for 29 years.Â  They have a daughter who lives in Colorado.Â  The Rasmussens enjoy hiking and exploring Idaho with their golden retriever, Piper.
