After living a diverse life in many cities and two continents, Councilmember Geoff and his wife of 31 years, Beth, made Caldwell their home in 2007. Together, they have enjoyed serving this community and raising a family here, Their daughter Aubrey and her husband Frisco Adams now reside in Nampa, and their daughter Miranda and son Geoff both still reside in Caldwell.

Geoff's decision to follow Jesus Christ at the age of 18 has guided his life ever since. He has managed several small businesses over the years, was employed as a banker, and has served abroad as a missionary in Colombia. He has served locally as a pastor while volunteering as the Caldwell Police Chaplain for 12 years, Geoff has also spent time as a Deputy Coroner for Canyon County, and is now once again managing a small local business.

Geoff's priorities continue to be his faith, his family, and his community. He is looking forward to this new season of community service with expectation and anticipation of continued greatness for the City of Caldwell.

Geoff was appointed on February 16, 2022 to serve the remainder of the Seat #4 term, previously held by our current Mayor, Jarom Wagoner.
