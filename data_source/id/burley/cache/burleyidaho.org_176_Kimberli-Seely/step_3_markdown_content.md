### Council Member

## Biography

My experience with Burley City Council began nearly 25 years ago. I attended council meetings when I worked for a local television station as a news anchor, producer and reporter. In the years following I served in other civic capacities including Burley Centennial Committee, Storybook Park Public Relations Chair, the election committee to form the Oregon Trail Recreation District, and as a participant in Strategic Planning Meetings for the City of Burley. I also served as Burley Area Action Team member, and later as president, where I assisted the team in qualifying Burley as an Idaho Gem community.Â 

Â 

Both my grandparents and parents are from Burley. After my parents completed their advanced education and professional training they returned to Burley with their family. I was a junior in high school and became a 1989 Burley High School graduate. I earned both a bachelorâ€™s and masterâ€™s degree in Communications from BYU. Presently I work as an adjunct professor for two Idaho colleges, teaching communications and sociology. My husband and I chose to raise our children in Burley with confidence in our schools and the local community.

Â 

When I was a child, my family lived in Mexico for three years. I attended elementary school speaking Spanish. Because of that experience and others, I have some understanding for those who want to feel included and accepted in a community. I aim to be part of the efforts to work for and fulfill the mission of maintaining Burley as a great community for families and businesses. From the time I would visit my grandparents in Burley to when I returned to raise my family in Burley, I have seen a lot of changes and growth. As we look forward, I aim to respect the past and protect our future.

Â 

It is with humility that I hope to serve on the council. Â I recognize it is an honor to be an elected city council member and call Burley, Idaho my hometown.
