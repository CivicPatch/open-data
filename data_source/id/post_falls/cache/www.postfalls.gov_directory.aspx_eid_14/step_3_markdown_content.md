# Joe Malloy

 

[City Council](https://www.postfalls.gov/Directory.aspx?DID=10)  
Title: City Council President Seat 3  
[Email Joe Malloy](mailto:jmalloy@postfalls.gov)

Term of Office: 2024 through 2027

## Overview

"I am honored to have the opportunity to serve the people of Post Falls. This community has given me a lot, and I am excited to give back. I'm an avid snowmobiler. I like to hunt, although I'm not very good at it… I just like to tromp through the woods with a high-powered rifle for no other reason than it is my God-given right as an American. Whether rafting, fishing, hiking, biking, or whatever, I love the outdoors and all North Idaho has to offer. My primary goal on the Council is to attract business to Post Falls by minimizing the financial and bureaucratic hurdles to development and/or expansion. Further, I believe it is of utmost importance that citizens' personal and property rights are respected, and their tax dollars are spent as wisely, efficiently, and frugally as possible."

Joe Malloy was elected to City Council Seat 3 in 2012. He is currently serving his third term on the Council.

He is a Lake City High School graduate (1995) and has a B.A. in Business Administration from Washington State University. He was a Sales Executive with Idaho Veneer Company from 2000-2011 and currently is the Head of Procurement for Outotec (USA) Inc. Joe is a North Idaho native and has been a homeowner in Post Falls since 2005.
