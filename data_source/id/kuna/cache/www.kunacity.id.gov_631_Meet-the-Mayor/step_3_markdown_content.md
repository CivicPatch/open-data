## Message from Mayor Stear

> ![Joe Stear Mayor 2018](https://www.kunacity.id.gov/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=4138)I want to take a moment to welcome you to the City of Kuna! In 1865, long before Kuna was officially recognized as a village or a town, it began as a modest settlement and stagecoach stop on the "Silver Trail," which connected Boise City to the mining town of Silver City. On September 15, 1915, Kuna was incorporated as a village. Having lived in Kuna since 1965, I am proud to call it home. I graduated from Kuna High School and owned a local business here for many years. Throughout my time in Kuna, I've witnessed its transformation into a strong and compassionate community, where neighbors readily support one another. Our city offers numerous amenities, including excellent schools, businesses and lively community events. If you get a moment, I highly recommend visiting our new Kuna Arts and History Center. It's a wonderful opportunity to delve into the rich past of our town and discover the stories that have shaped our unique identity. Whether you're new to the area, just passing through, or have been here for some time, I encourage you to stop by City Hall for a chat about our wonderful city. I also extend an invitation to our City Council Meetings, held on the 1st and 3rd Tuesday of each month at 6:00 PM in the City Council Chambers at Kuna City Hall, 751 W. 4th Street.
