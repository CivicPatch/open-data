## How the Council is Elected and Establish Policies

Six Council members, elected with no party affiliation, make up the City Council. They are elected to four-year overlapping terms as part-time officials.  Terms are staggered, and elections are held every two years.

The City Council establishes policies governing City operations and enacts ordinances and resolutions to amend or update the St.Anthony Municipal Code.  The Council levies taxes, adopts the City's yearly budget, and appoints members to citizen advisory boards.  Decisions made by the City Council protect the health, safety, general welfare, and future well-being of the citizens of St. Anthony.

\* The mayor does not vote on any issue unless there is a tie vote among the council members.
