## Biography

Council Member Jensen was born and raised in Pocatello, Idaho and graduated from Pocatello High School in 1986. He spend much of his younger life visiting Blackfoot, as both parents and grandparents were from the area.  After serving a mission for the LDS church in the Italy Catania Mission, he came home and married Ann Marie Salverson, who was born and raised in Blackfoot, and graduated from Blackfoot High School in 1987.  In 1993, they moved to Blackfoot with their daughter.

It wasn't long after moving to Blackfoot that he was asked to be a Scoutmaster for the LDS church, carrying on the family tradition that started with his grandfather.  While attending Idaho State University (ISU) college of Engineering, he worked at a number of local companies such as Spudnik, Mr. Mower, and Miles Heating.  He graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from ISU in 1999 and went to work for the Idaho National Laboratory (INL).  After a few years of work, he became a professional engineer and has worked in that occupation for a variety of INL contractors and private firms ever since.

Councilman Jensen and his wife had three more children and have continued to raise their family in Blackfoot with two children graduating from Blackfoot and one from Bingham Academy.  He and his wife recently became grandparents when his daughter, who still lives in Blackfoot, had their first granddaughter.

He has served as the Council President for many years and has work with most all of the City Departments over his time on the Council.
