State Statutes provide for two forms of municipal government within the State of Idaho, the Council-Mayor form and the Council-Manager form. This City of Gooding has the Council-Mayor form of government within which there are four Council members and a Mayor which are elected separately and serve a four year term. The four Council members, are all elected at large. Council member elections are held every two years. Terms are staggered so that two of the four seats are open at each election. The next election will be conducted November 7, 2023.

The Council serves as the legislative and judicial arm of the City government and enacts ordinances (local laws), passes resolutions (statements of policy), confirms the Mayor’s appointments of City officials and citizen advisory commission members, approves the City’s annual budget, and serves as the quasi-judicial hearing body for public hearings and appeals of other City Boards and Commissions. Regular meetings of the Council are held in the Council Chambers of City Hall, located at 308 5th Ave East. Meetings are usually scheduled for the first and third Monday of each month, except when those days coincide with a legal holiday. Meetings begin at 6:30 p.m.

The Council elects a President from among its members at its first meeting in January every year. The Council President serves as Mayor in his/her absence and has such other duties and responsibilities as the Council may from time to time by vote or by resolution.
