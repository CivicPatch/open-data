District 4

![Jordan Morales smiling on nature trail.](https://www.cityofboise.org/media/17504/jordan-morales-headshot.jpg?width=1200&mode=max&upscale=false)

Jordan Morales grew up in several different parts of Boise but has called District 4 home alongside his wife Katie and their three children for over 17 years. They appreciate the access to great schools, libraries, public transit, safe streets, parks and natural open spaces to walk, bike and paddle, nearby family and many wonderful neighbors.

After serving a two-year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Southern New Jersey and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Jordan completed his Bachelor's degree in Entrepreneurship Management from Boise State University. Since then, he has managed business operations for Boise State’s Computer Science program as it has quadrupled in size, playing a role in the health and growth of Boise’s technology ecosystem. As a member of the Bronco Athletic Association Board of Directors, he is also actively engaged in volunteering and leading fundraising efforts in support of Boise State student-athletes.

Jordan found an early appreciation for local government through his grandfather’s service in the Idaho State Senate and later from an amazing Honors American Government teacher in high school. Jordan has served as an active Precinct Committeeperson in the District 4 area from 2013-2023, as a Chief Judge of Elections for Ada County since 2018 and twice as a State of Idaho post-election audit commissioner, serving with a passion for including more Boiseans into our civic processes.

Jordan was elected to Boise City Council in 2023 as the first representative from the new District 4 and believes that by engaging our neighborhoods and working together, we can make Boise an even better place for all of us to live, work, and thrive.
