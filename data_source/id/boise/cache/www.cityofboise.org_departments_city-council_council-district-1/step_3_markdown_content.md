# Council Member Luci Willits

District 1

![Luci Willits](https://www.cityofboise.org/media/13403/willits_luci.jpg?width=1200&mode=max&upscale=false)

Luci Willits, a lifelong Idahoan and proud product of its public schools, brings a unique blend of experience and dedication to her role as Boise City Council member for District 1. Raised in eastern Idaho by a farmer and small business owner, Luci understands the value of hard work and the importance of community.

After moving to the Treasure Valley, Luci built a successful career in the private and public sectors. Her diverse background and 20 years as a West Boise resident, give her a deep understanding of the issues facing the city and its residents.

Luci's forward-thinking approach and problem-solving skills have been instrumental in her role on the City Council. She is committed to maintaining Boise's clean streets, safe neighborhoods, and family-friendly atmosphere in our growing city.

First elected in 2021 and re-elected in 2023, Luci's priorities include public safety, library access, and maintaining and expanding Boise’s beautiful parks. She actively engages with the Centennial and West Valley neighborhood associations in her district to ensure their voices are heard and their concerns are addressed.
