# Council Member Jimmy Hallyburton

District 6

![Smiling man wearing a bandana](https://www.cityofboise.org/media/9226/jimmy-hallyburton.jpg?width=1200&mode=max&upscale=false)

Jimmy Hallyburton was born and raised on the rural edges of NW Boise. He spent most of his youth exploring the foothills, neighboring farmland and country roads by foot and by bike. “Be home by dinner,” and “be kind to others,” are the only rules he recalls growing up with. Treating people with kindness remains the cornerstone of his principles and passion today.

After fighting wildfires on the Idaho City Hotshots and graduating from Boise State University, he created a nonprofit called the Boise Bicycle Project (BBP) in 2007. As BBP's Executive Director, he spent 16 years working with nonprofits, schools, community centers, refugee resettlement organizations, and the community at large to ensure everyone had access to bicycles, bicycle repair, and safe places to ride. He’s helped distribute over 20,000 bicycles to the community in need and pass life-saving policy and legislation at local, state, and national levels.

Jimmy was elected to his first term on Boise City Council in 2019 in an at-large seat. During his first four years, he led efforts to adopt the 112-mile Pathways Masterplan, a Boise Vision Zero Plan to prevent traffic fatalities, a Pollinator Friendly Tree Resolution, and renter protections including prohibiting source of income discrimination. In 2023, he created Boise and ACHD’s first ever Traffic Fatality Review Board, and played a major role in the adoption of the City’s historic Modern Zoning Code.

Jimmy was reelected to Boise City Council in 2023 as the representative for District 6, the area he was born and raised. In his second term, Jimmy is committed to using the same value-based collaborative approach he learned in the nonprofit sector to build out the Pathways Masterplan, launch new youth engagement efforts, work with neighbors to build safe and vibrant neighborhoods, and partner with ACHD to build safer streets for all types of road users. He believes in the power of teamwork and creativity to create positive change and is excited to work with Mayor McLean, fellow council members, city staff, and the community at large to build a brighter Boise.
