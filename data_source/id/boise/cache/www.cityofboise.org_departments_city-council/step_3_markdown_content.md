# City Council

The Boise City Council is the legislative body for Boise City with policy setting and budgetary authority.

During the 2020 legislative session, the State passed a bill (HB413) requiring cities with populations over 100,000 people to create districts for City Council elections. A [districting map](https://www.cityofboise.org/departments/city-council/city-council-election-districts/ "City Council Election Districts") was then created based on 2020 census data for the 2023 election. In 2023, all six council districts were up for election, and odd-numbered districts ran for four-year terms and even-numbered districts for two-year terms.
