**History**

In 1882 the OSL built a standard gauge rail line from Pocatello to Port Neuf. This line laid new rail bed, shortening the old route and establishing a depot at Port Neuf, which they renamed McCammon after J.H. McCammon, a railroad official.

On January 15, 1908, McCammon became an incorporated village. In 1910 the U.S. Census reported a population of 321.
