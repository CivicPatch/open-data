# DISTRICT 2

## Natalie Jangula was sworn into office for District 2 on January 2, 2024. She served in Seat 3 for two years until a legislative change required Nampa to create council districts and council members to live in their district. Jangula lives in District 2 and ran when that seat came up for election.

Natalie is a 5th generation Idahoan, who is proud of her American values and heritage that date back to the revolutionary war.

She is a Financial Advisor Administrative Assistant for TyRell Stevens at Allegis Financial Partners, and enjoys helping others achieve their financial retirement goals.

Community involvement has always been important to Natalie. Her most cherished memories were helping during Hurricane Sandy and assisting with wish granting for Make-a-Wish Foundation of America. During her reign as Mrs. Idaho United States 2015, Natalie had many opportunities to serve the people of Idaho, and following her reign, became the Ambassador of the Idaho Potato Drop. She is currently a member of the Nampa Lions Club, involved in her church community and enjoys volunteering at her kids’ schools and activities. She also volunteers with the Millennial Choirs &amp; Orchestras.

Natalie is the proud mother of two pre-teens, Kadence and Trent, who have provided her with a bachelor’s degree in dealing with roller coaster emotions, a master’s degree in wiping up water on the bathroom floor, and a PhD in laundry folding and calendaring.

As an outdoor enthusiast, Natalie enjoys backpacking, camping, hiking, biking, hot spring discovering, paddle boarding and dutch oven cooking. She also enjoys singing, playing piano and participating as an Alto 1 in the Grand Chorus of the Millennial Choirs &amp; Orchestras.

Councilwoman Jangula is grateful for the opportunity to serve the citizens of Nampa. She vows to uphold Nampa’s vision of creating a caring community where people live, work, play, worship and raise their families, with an eye toward establishing Nampa as a place of economic opportunity, with an independent spirit and unique identity.
