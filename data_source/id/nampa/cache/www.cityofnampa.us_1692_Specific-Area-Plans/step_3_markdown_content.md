# Specific Area Plans

## What is a Specific Area Plan?

A specific area plan is a planning tool that the City of Nampa uses to look at areas within the City in more detail. If the Comprehensive Plan is a 50,000-foot view of the entire City, then a specific area plan is a 10,000-foot view of a certain area within the City. City staff, elected officials, and the public are always looking for ways to create certainty when managing growth and development. A specific area plan assists us in creating that certainty by implementing a strategy for an area, so that it develops out in a way that alighns with the City's long-term vision and goals.

When drafting a specific area plan, we not only look at the uses that will go in, like residential and commercial, but also the built environment, like how the buildings will look and what kind of landscaping and pedestrian amenities, such as pathways, will be installed. We also consider transportation; how ill people navigate this area? Where are they coming from and where are they going?

## How Do We Develop a Specific Area Plan?

We develop these plans through a public process, by gathering input from the community on what their needs and wants are, balanced with what is feasible. It may be nice to consider only having single family homes in an area, but where are those people going out to eat and where are they buying their groceries? Ultimately, it is City Council's decision to approve the adoption of a specific area plan.

Nampa's Planning &amp; Zoning department has developed several specific area plants, such as the SH-16 Corridor Specific Area Plan. This plan focuses on the area around the new State Highway 16 connection in east Nampa. This was a year long planning effort. Depending on the scope of the project, a specific area plan can take anywhere from a few months to a few years to complete.

## How Do We Implement a Specific Area Plan?

Following the adoption of a specific area plan, City staff will draft code language for City Council to adopt, to implement the specific details of the plan. For example, in the SH-16 plan, a district was established along Ustick Road, within this district the buildings along Ustick Road are required to have specific lighting fixtures and the buildings and parking lots must be oriented a certain direction. Each of these small elements lend to creating a unique sense of place within the district.

## How Do You Get Involved in a Planning Process Like This?

Being involved in the development of a specific area plan is one of the more meaningful ways you can help shape your community. For example, in the SH-16 plan, we asked the community to provide feedback on the theme of the area, such as seeing modern looking buildings versus more traditional buildings and providing input on specific destinations they would like to see along SH-16, such as parks and pathways and entertainment districts. To find out what types of long-range planning projects are currently being worked on, you can reach out to Nampa's Planning &amp; Zoning Department.  You can always ask how you can be involved in the planning process.
