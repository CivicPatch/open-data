# Nampa Mayor's Teen Council

## **What is the Mayor's Teen Council?**

The Nampa Mayor's Teen Council is an official council for the City of Nampa made up of 9th-12th graders from public, public charter, private and even those who are home schooled.

Applications can be submitted on the application below and **parents must give permission for high school students to join.** 

## **Why should I join?**

To gain leadership skills, participate in Community Service Projects (which almost all colleges and college scholarships require), make a difference in your community, and learn how local government really works.

## **How do I join?**

It’s simple. Talk to your parents and complete the **below** application -- if you're reading this after the school year has begun, please email your interest to mayor {at} cityofnampa {dot} us.

### ****When are meetings held?****

We meet the second and fourth Wednesdays of every month from September—May at 4 p.m. (locations vary but are primarily held at Nampa City Hall - 411 3rd Street South.) If you want to be involved, we would love to have you join -- bring your friends with you! **There is no cost to join or to participate.**

## **What types of activities does the Nampa Mayor’s Teen Council do?**

It is really up to the teens who are involved. What is important to you, and how do you want to make a difference?

In previous years, MTC has produced a Public Service Announcement that aired on Ch 7, Ch 6, Ch 9, Ch 2 &amp; CableOne on Crosswalk Safety &amp; Distracted Driving, and written &amp; performed Seatbelt Education in local schools and at after-school programs and make over 100 birthday boxes for veterans. 

Other activities have included: Rake Up Nampa, Clean Up Nampa, Downtown Trick or Treat, Adopt A Family for Christmas, Bell Ringing for Salvation Army, Special Olympic Idaho Winter Games, Special Olympics USA Youth Activation Summit, Health Fest, and we help organizations like Kiwanis and the Nampa Chamber of Commerce.

Local businesses and city departments have allowed MTC to go on tours, which have built some great relationships.

Our goal is to provide an opportunity for students to visit Washington, D.C., every other year. We help fundraise but there is typically a cost for students. More information on this opportunity will be shared at teen council meetings.
