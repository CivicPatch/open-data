# **PROCESS &amp; TIMELINE FOR CREATING NAMPA'S FIRST COUNCIL DISTRICTS**

## **Why did we create council districts?**

Under Idaho Code section 50-707A, [“\[a\]ny city having more than one hundred thousand (100,000)  inhabitants…shall establish districts and shall elect councilmen by districts for districts so established.](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/title50/t50ch7/sect50-707a/)” The most recent federal decennial census places the City of Nampa’s population at 100,200. The City of Nampa is therefore required, for the first time in its history, to establish council districts and must do so prior to the City of Nampa’s next general election on **November 7, 2023.**

On March 21, 2022, the Nampa City Council [passed an ordinance](https://www.cityofnampa.us/DocumentCenter/View/14539) to establish the formation of a Districting Committee. This committee is tasked with the work of proposing a recommendation for council districts for public hearing and Nampa City Council ratification. The committee will be comprised of nine citizen members, all appointed by Nampa Mayor Debbie Kling and confirmed by the council, who shall work with three ex-officio members, consisting of Canyon County Clerk Chris Yamamoto (or a designee), Nampa Planner Rodney Ashby (or a designee), and the City of Nampa engineer (or a designee). 

Voting members of the Nampa Districting Committee include nine Nampa residents from diverse geographic areas within Nampa city limits which can be found below. Six members must live in specific geographic areas and three members may reside anywhere within city limits. *The below map does not reflect the proposed district boundary lines; it reflects the six areas within city limits divided for the sake of ensuring a geographically diverse committee.*   
   
The nine committee members are voting members and serve without salary or compensation for their service. *Anyone who serves on the Nampa Districting Committee shall be ineligible to run for a Nampa City Council seat for five years following such service*. Several meetings will be required to draft the districting map for city council zones by fall of 2022. The work of the committee is expected to conclude by the end of the year.

# DISTRICT MAP GUIDELINES FOR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION

## The public was invited to share their suggestions for the six council districts. **In order to meet statutory requirements, the districts must include the following criteria:**

- **The population of each district must be as equal as possible and the population data from the 2020 federal decennial census must be used (additional population estimates or future growth cannot be considered at this time).**

<!--THE END-->

- **The difference between the largest and smallest districts cannot be larger than ten percent (10%)\*.**

*\*The US Supreme Court in Reynolds v. Symms and in the Idaho Supreme Court in Durst v. Idaho Commission for Reapportionment both recognized that the equal protection clause of the US Constitution requires substantial equality of population in the elected official districts. The courts recognized that a 10% maximum population deviation typically meets that constitutional standard. The maximum population deviation expresses the difference between the least populous district and the most populous district in terms of the percentage those districts deviate from the ideal district population. For example, if among the six council districts, the least populous district is four percent below the ideal population number and the most populous district is four percent above the ideal population number then the deviation would be: 4-(-4) or 8 percent.*

- **The new districts must keep** [**current voting precincts**](https://www.cityofnampa.us/DocumentCenter/View/15049) **(established by Canyon County Elections) intact.**
- **Precincts in a certain district must be touching.**
