**Eric Erickson** was born in Cedar City, Utah on December 3rd, 1956, to Rex and Beverly Erickson. He is the second of four children: older sister Lynn, younger brother Neal, and younger sister Tracy. They moved to Rexburg in December of 1967 and Rexburg has been home ever since. His most vivid memory of that first day in town was driving by Key Bank at high noon and reading the temperature on a sign stating 21 degrees below zero. He graduated from Madison High School with the class of 1975 and attended Ricks College for one semester before leaving to serve a two-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Paris France. After his service in France, he returned to Rexburg in January of 1978 and Ricks College in August of that year he met a lovely young lady Tammy Cheney from Burley, Idaho. They were married in June of 1979 and moved to Logan, Utah so that he could finish his education. He graduated with a degree in Business Administration and Finance and returned to Rexburg to help in the family business. His Father Rex, brother Neal, and himself owned and operated Erickson Pontiac and GMC for over 53 years. During that time, he did everything from washing cars to completing multi-million-dollar finance deals. The family sold the business a few years ago and he is now retired. He and his wife have five children, three girls and two boys, all graduates of Madison High School. Over the years he has tried to stay involved in community affairs having served as President of the Chamber of Commerce and on the Board of Directors of the Better Business Bureau of Eastern Idaho. He has served on various association boards and commissions including as President of the Idaho Auto Dealers Association. He is the governor-appointed member of the Dealer Advisory Board for the Idaho Transportation Department. Recently, he has served as a member of the Planning and Zoning Commission.  

Mr. Erickson has been heavily involved in his church having been called to serve as Bishop of the Rexburg 13th Ward and as the President of the Rexburg Idaho Center Stake. He is proud of the community and appreciates all the good friends and neighbors here in Rexburg and Madison County
