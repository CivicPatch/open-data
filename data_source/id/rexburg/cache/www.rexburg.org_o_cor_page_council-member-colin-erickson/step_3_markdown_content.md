“I was born and raised in a big family on a farm in Star Valley, Wyoming.  I graduated from Star Valley High School. I met my wife, Jean, at Ricks College, after my mission to San Diego, California.  I started my law enforcement career while in Ogden, Utah finishing my education in criminal justice at WSU.  After completing my bachelor’s degree, I was hired with the City of Rexburg Police Department and worked my way up through to being Lieutenant over Community Policing.  I have loved raising our four wonderful children while being a resident of Rexburg for almost 30 years.  I claim it a privilege to be a part of this community and the great state of Idaho with all of the outdoor opportunities we have right in our backyard.  Participating in outdoor activities such as fishing, hunting, ATV riding, and camping are all things I enjoy doing with my family and friends. I have spent my career being proactive in working with all the stakeholders involved to focus on preventative measures and in building sustainable programs with businesses, schools, and community members.  I recently celebrated 33 years with my wife, Jean, who has been an educator for Madison School District for 20 of those years.  With both of us being involved with the public through all those years, it has brought a great love for the people of Rexburg and all that the city offers.

One of my proudest accomplishments is seeing our two daughters and two sons as responsible adults and productive citizens.  They are all married and are starting their own families.  I have learned that the greatest title ever is “Papa” to three grandchildren so far and look forward to more in the future. I pride myself on being a hard worker and have had great success in helping to instill that quality into our children.

In my career, I am proud to be a graduate of session 273 of the FBI National Academy.  This honor is earned by less than 2% of all law enforcement worldwide.  It is a three-month leadership training in Quantico, Virginia.  I had the privilege of representing the Rexburg Police Department back in the summer of 2018.  I brought back leadership skills that have helped me train the upcoming officers to carry on the tradition of greatness.  In being involved in Community Policing for the past 20 years, I have realized how important it is to develop trust in strong working relationships. 

We all need to realize that we are all just doing our best with the situations we are currently in.  We all have strengths and weaknesses and none of us are perfect.  We need to be tolerant of each other and do what we can to be builders and problem solvers, but also have and show respect for ourselves and for those around us.  I look forward to this new learning curve and look forward to working with all the great people in Rexburg.”
