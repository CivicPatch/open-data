Bryanna Johnson was born and raised in Utah. She went to BYU-Idaho for two years before attending BYU in Provo where she graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in education. She met her husband, Jon Paul, in Provo and they have been married for 17 years. They have three sons ages 15, 11, and 7. They have lived in Rexburg since 2010 and Jon Paul teaches Physics at BYU-Idaho.

 Bryanna has taught preschool and piano lessons but her favorite job is being a mom and she has devoted much of her time to her children for the past 15 years. She loves serving in the community and having opportunities to make a difference. Before being elected to the City Council, she served on the city’s parks committee and has been involved in planning the city’s 4th of July festivities.

 She loves to be outside as much as possible. You can often find her and her family hiking and snowshoeing in the Tetons, camping, biking, or golfing.
