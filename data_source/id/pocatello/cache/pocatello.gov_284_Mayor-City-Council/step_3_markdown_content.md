Welcome to the City of Pocatello's website! Whether you're a resident, a visitor, or just interested in our community, you will find a wealth of information about our city and local government in these web pages.

With a population of over 55,000, Pocatello is the fifth largest city in Idaho, yet we have a friendly, small-town attitude. We take pride in our community and encourage both civic and government participation from all citizens. Our history is very rich and varied and has earned us designations as the "Gateway to the Northwest" and the "U. S. Smile Capital."

Pocatello also offers a variety of recreational opportunities through our [Parks and Recreation Department](https://pocatello.gov/278/Parks-Recreation) and Idaho State University, as well as quick access to regional recreation. We also have a pro-active economic development team that will do everything they can to assist you. In other words, Pocatello is the perfect place for you, your family, and your business.

Please make use of our website to learn more about what we have to offer. You can also read more about Pocatello in our most recent [City Newsletter](https://pocatello.gov/293/Mayors-Newsletter). If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:mayor@pocatello.gov), or by calling 208-234-6163 or stop by City Hall.

Sincerely,

Mayor Brian Blad

## Welcoming and Inclusive City Resolution

### Passed December 7, 2023

A RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF POCATELLO, A MUNICIPAL CORPORATION OF IDAHO, AFFIRMING THE CITY OF POCATELLO AS A WELCOMING AND INCLUSIVE CITY THAT CELEBRATES DIVERSITY, PROMOTES EQUALITY AND FOSTERS RESPECT FOR ALL RESIDENTS

WHEREAS, the Mayor and City Council of Pocatello adopted Resolution No. 2020-11 on October 1, 2020 affirming the City of Pocatello as a welcoming and inclusive city that celebrates diversity; and 

WHEREAS, the Human Relations Advisory Committee initiated a review of the adopted resolution and recommends modifying some of the language to encompass all groups and individuals; and 

WHEREAS, the City of Pocatello has long been a home to indigenous people, migrants, and immigrants; and has remained true to our heritage of welcoming everyone regardless of age, race, ethnicity or place of origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, immigration or refugee status, political ideology, economic status, religious affiliations, disability status, or other marginalized identities; and 

WHEREAS, the City has long been recognized as a place where all of its residents thrive and are essential to contribute to the City's economic growth and overall prosperity for current and future generations; and 

WHEREAS, historically, the City represented a wide variety of ethnic groups where families lived and worked together in harmony despite their differences for decades; and currently, the City is home to Idaho State University where people from all walks of life are welcome; and 

WHEREAS, new residents, whether permanent or temporary, are a vital part of our community, bringing fresh perspectives and new ideas, starting businesses, adding to the talent base and contributing to the vibrant, diverse community that we all value; and
