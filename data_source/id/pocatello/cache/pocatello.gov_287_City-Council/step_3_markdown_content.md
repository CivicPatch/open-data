**Left to Right:** Rick Cheatum, Josh Mansfield, Mayor Brian Blad, Brent Nichols, President Linda Leeuwrik, Hayden Paulsen, and Corey Mangum

## About the City Council

The six members of the City Council work part-time and function as the legislative body of the City.

City elections are held in the fall of odd numbered years. The Mayor and City Council Members are elected at-large, on a non-partisan basis for four-year terms. Each Council Member is elected to a specific seat, but the seats do not represent geographic areas, which means all six Council Members represent the entire community.

### Mission

The mission of the Mayor &amp; Council Department is to exercise executive management of the municipal corporation by creation and implementation of vision and policy, service to constituents, distribution of corporate communication, stakeholder involvement and management of day-to-day operations.

### Mayor/Council Form of Government

Pocatello has chosen the strong mayor/council form of government. The 6 members of the City Council work part-time and function as the legislative body of the city. The Mayor is the full-time administrator managing the day-to-day activities of the city. While the Mayor chairs the City Council meetings and sets the meeting agenda, the Mayor may only vote in the case of a tie.

## Mayor Brian Blad

Mayor Brian Blad was elected into office November 2009. His current term ends in 2025. Learn more about [Mayor Brian Blad](https://pocatello.gov/Directory.aspx?EID=62).

If you have any questions, feel free to contact Mayor Blad via [email](mailto:mayor@pocatello.gov), call 208-234-6163, or stop by his office at City Hall.

## Welcoming and Inclusive City Resolution

### Passed October 1, 2020

A RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF POCATELLO, A MUNICIPAL CORPORATION OF IDAHO, AFFIRMING THE CITY OF POCATELLO AS A WELCOMING AND INCLUSIVE CITY THAT CELEBRATES DIVERSITY, PROMOTES EQUALITY AND FOSTERS RESPECT FOR ALL RESIDENTS

WHEREAS, the City of Pocatello has long been a home to indigenous people, migrants, and immigrants; and has remained true to our heritage of welcoming everyone regardless of age, race, ethnicity or place of origin, gender identity, immigration or refugee status, political ideology, economic status, or religious affiliations; and

WHEREAS, the City has long been recognized as a place where all of its residents thrive and are essential to contribute to the City's economic growth and overall prosperity for current and future generations; and 

WHEREAS, historically, the City represented a wide variety of ethnic groups where families lived and worked together in harmony despite their differences for decades; and currently, the City is home to Idaho State University where people from all walks of life are welcome; and 

WHEREAS, new residents, whether permanent or temporary, are a vital part of our community, bringing fresh perspectives and new ideas, starting businesses, adding to the talent base and contributing to the vibrant, diverse community that we all value; and

WHEREAS, the City engages in public policy, regulatory, and civic initiatives to support local organizations that promote understanding and friendship in the community for all citizens and visitors; and
