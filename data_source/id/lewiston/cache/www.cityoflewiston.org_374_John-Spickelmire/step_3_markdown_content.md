## Biography

John was born and raised in Grangeville, Idaho, enlisted in the US Navy in 1982 and served for 7 years. In 1991, he was hired on with the Federal Aviation Administration as an Electronics Technician in Seattle, Washington. John retired with the FAA in September of 2017 as the Alaska Technical Operations District manager. 

John and his wife Janice (also a Navy veteran) moved to Lewiston, Idaho in the Spring of 2018. Lewiston fits perfectly into their lifestyle and they plan to make it their permanent retirement home. They enjoy traveling and sightseeing throughout the Northwest. John is an avid fisherman and they both enjoy boating in the local rivers and reservoirs. 

John hopes to represent the voice of the community and bring sound business decisions to the Lewiston City Council. He has no party affiliation and prefers to take on each issue independently without following a party line or agenda.
