## Biography

Kassee Forsmann is an Engineering Support Specialist at Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories. She always felt something was missing and had a calling for a bigger purpose. Kassee knew she wanted to be a part of making a change and local politics became her goal. One of Kassee’s favorite quotes is “All we have to fear is fear itself” by Franklin D. Roosevelt”. An accomplishment she is proud of includes working her way up through Schweitzer Engineering starting as an Assembler to challenging herself to apply for the position of Engineering Support Specialist. Kassee has navigated her way through learning about electrical circuits and has implemented several new processes, while gaining the respect and experience she needs to do the job.

Kassee grew up on a 12-acre farm. Her childhood was full of traveling, hiking, fishing, and enjoying the outdoors. With Kassee’s childhood, it only makes sense she would move to Lewiston for the outdoors, small-town feel, and beautiful views. She enjoys time with her family, camping, being outdoors, going on road trips, taking her Jeep out to the mountains, and enjoying the wonderful smell of the woods. Kassee is married to a Marine who also shares the love of the outdoors and the American dream. They have a little boy who loves to be on the go at all times, and always wants to be a part of what mommy and daddy are doing.
