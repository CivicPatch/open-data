## Biography

Jessica grew up in the small Eastern Washington town of St. John. She graduated from the International Air and Hospitality Academy in Vancouver WA as an Airline/Travel Specialist in 2007. After graduation, she worked as a hotel clerk for a few months before being employed as a Customer Service Agent by Continental Airlines in Seatac WA for 3 years. Jessica moved back to the region in 2010 and started her career with Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories where she worked until having her first child in 2022. She now manages and maintains their families' rental properties as well as taking care of their small hobby farm and child.

Jessica has lived in Lewiston since June of 2014 after meeting her husband Matthew. She has always loved Lewiston and its small town feel with amenities. She and her family enjoy boating and camping on the reservoir in the summer, snowmobiling in the mountains in the winter and riding ATVs in the spring and fall.

Being passionate about making a difference and a strong pull in her heart from GOD, Jessica is hoping to be what Lewiston needs.
