[Email the Mayor](mailto:alicep@cityofhomedale.org) 

I am life-long citizen of the City of Homedale, a graduate of Homedale High School, and an active community member. My family-owned trucking business operates nationwide and is headquartered just across the Snake River. My history, present, and future are rooted in Homedale. Five generations of my family live in this area. I am deeply vested in seeing it grow and prosper.

I envision Homedale…

As a safe community atmosphere for our citizens and visitors while they work, play, and worship.

As a family-friendly community providing family-oriented events, activities, and community gathering areas such as our many parks, swimming pool, ball fields, Frisbee golf course, and fishing boat docks.

As a destination location drawing in visitors year after year with our annual events as well as our civic amenities.

As a promoter of economic development to create positive growth bringing in sustainable businesses that provide needed services and jobs to our residents.

As a drug-free community through the combined efforts of the Homedale Police Department, the school district, parents, community leaders, special drug task forces and other law enforcement agencies.

As a clean and aesthetically pleasing community by encouraging citizens and businesses to take pride in their property and maintaining high standards for city property and parks.

As a strongly connected community where the Homedale School District and the City work closely together for the benefit of our youth and entire community.

As a city where we all join together for the good of the entire community.

I will consistently put the people who I serve first and I am excited to contribute to a great future for the City of Homedale.
