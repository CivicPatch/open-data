Kuther provided a list of what his plans are regarding rules and steps required to place a trailer in his park. Cm. Ingram and Cm. Zenner have concerns with the park becoming another eyesore and the potential cost to the city. Cm. Ingram has also requested that all infrastructure be installed before she considers any permits. Supervisor Cardwell stated that the plan is to push 8th through to Willow and Birch to 8th, which would give the park the access that it would need. Mayor Nelson asked the council to review the city ordinance on RV parks so that when Mr. Kuther presents his requested permit to the city that they will have a clear understanding of what is allowed and what is not.

<!--THE END-->

3. **Nuisance Properties:** Clerk Schmidt reported to the council that Attorney Lewis wanted to know if she was to proceed with the declaratory judgment against the resident at 202 5th Per the council, while he has moved some items from his property, he has not made a significant amount of progress and Cm.

4. **Legion Hall RFP for Architect**: Clerk Schmidt reported that the city is ready to move forward with the plans for remodeling the hall. She asked the council how long they would like to leave the advertisement open; council discussed and decided to leave it open until the August council meeting.

<!--THE END-->

5. **Area of Impact Review:** Clerk Schmidt informed the council that cities in Idaho are now required to confirm their Area of Impact with counties every 5 years. Schmidt forwarded the information to the City Attorney for review and Lewis supplied a map showing the city’s current Area of Impact and a map showing what a 2-mile Area of Impact would look like. The council decided that they would like to modify the current Area of Impact to include the 2-mile allowance. Clerk Schmidt will inform Lewis of the council’s decision, and she will put together the appropriate paperwork to make the modification. Mayor Nelson will work with Attorney Lewis and the County commissioners to set the new area of impact at 2-miles.

<!--THE END-->

6. **Land App Project Update:** Equipment and materials were delivered this last week, and construction will proceed. Cm. Zenner got a chance to go up and look at the reservoirs. Crea will work on the access road and fill around the wet wells, install the pumps then work on the gravity flow road and the sprinkler lines. It will be dusty since the field was killed. The city will need to furnish water for the project.

<!--THE END-->

7. **Prairie Day**: Clerk Schmidt asked if the council would like to provide the meat again for Prairie Day and donate items for the auction. Cm Heartburg made a motion to pay for the meat and donate $400.00 towards auction items, Cm. Zenner seconded the motion, motion carried.

<!--THE END-->

8. **Pickleball Project Idea:** Larry and Stan Boyer want to establish a 2-pickleball court at the tennis courts. They would also like to get approval to place the pickleball court at the tennis court. They are estimating the cost at $6,000 per court and want a donation from the city for the project. The Prairie Day committee will be taking the lead in fundraising for the project. The council likes the idea of using the tennis court for the project but thinks that they can fundraise the project and for future maintenance.

<!--THE END-->

9. **Progressive Ag Day Donation:** Clerk Schmidt informed the council the hosts of Progressive Ag Day asked for a donation after the last council meeting, and due to the precedent of years past she authorized them to charge $100.00 to the Only Store as a donation. She asked the council to vote and back up her decision. Cm. Zenner made a motion to approve the donation, Cm. Heartburg seconded the motion, and the motion carried.

<!--THE END-->

10. **FYE 2026 Budget Review:** Clerk Schmidt provided a preliminary budget for the council to review, as budget planning has begun for the new year.

<!--THE END-->

11. **Reader Board:** Clerk Schmidt informed the council that we did not get the grant from Avista because there is already a reader board supported by Avista at the school; Bridget believes that Avista might donate funds towards a reader board instead of providing one. To secure the necessary funding for the reader board upgrade, we would need to conduct fundraising efforts and solicit donations. The council was not on board with doing that, and it was proposed to maybe give the reader board back to the Service League. Clerk Schmidt will work with Bridget to find a few small grants that we could use the funds to upgrade the reader board.

<!--THE END-->

12. **Zoll AED $1,450.00:** Clerk Schmidt informed the council that Patty Barnett had found a company that had AED units for sale for $1,450.00 and requested approval to purchase one of the devices. Cm Jensen moved to accept the price and purchase the AED unit. Cm. Heartburg seconded the motion. Motion passed.

**DEPARTMENTAL REPORTS**

1. Maintenance

**Water:** All good with water.

**Sewer:** The land app project starts today on Phase 2. Building is done on the outside and will be painting and putting the inside together.

**Streets:** Cardwell reported that the department will begin prepping for sealcoating.

**Parks:** Putting new oil on the bandshell in preparation for Prairie Day. While working this last month, Cardwell made contact with a new tree company, and he got a quote to grind the stumps that did not get done during Arbor Day, as the grinder broke down and maintenance was unable to finish the grinding. Cardwell feels that the quote is very reasonable at $550.00. The city will be responsible for the cleanup but overall, it will save money. The mayor and council agreed to the $550.00.

**Gravel:** The city has received invoices for having the gravel hauled in. There is still more rock that will need to be hauled at a later date.

**Summer help:** Cardwell hired Ryan and he is working on the band shell, 3 other applications were received for summer help but maintenance is keeping up so there’s no reason to hire anyone else.

2. Clerk

**City Code:** Clerk Schmidt informed the council that the city code is on the city website, and we received 10 binders of code for the office. If the council would like to take a book home to read or scan the code they are welcome to.

**Idaho Gem Grant:** Clerk Schmidt and Maintenance Cardwell have worked up a stormdrain project for the alley behind St. John Hardware to correct the runoff to the city system, upgrade city services and pave the alley. The grant is for $50,000 and the city match is wage and equipment. The council was in favor of the project as it would really benefit the downtown area.

**Wellness Champion:** Schmidt attended a III-A wellness Champion webinar and will be promoting wellness with our organization so I will be sending you all information…will see how it goes.

3. Fire Department: no report

<!--THE END-->

4. Code Enforcement: no report
