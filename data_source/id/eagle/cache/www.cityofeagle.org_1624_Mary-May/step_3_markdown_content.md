## Biography

**Mary May** is an experienced community leader with a demonstrated history of working in the public relations and communications industries. Her background includes Legislative/Governmental Partnerships, Transportation, Business Planning, Public Budgeting, Conflict Resolution, Community Relationships, Education, and Nonprofit Organizations. 

Mary is a fifth generation Idahoan and has lived in Eagle for more than 25 years. During that time, she has been an active member of the Eagle community, having previously served as a member on the Eagle Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors including as Vice-President, and on the Eagle Mayor’s Advisory Council. She has also founded or been involved with numerous Eagle-centric events and initiatives, including the Eagle Food and Wine Festival (a popular event benefitting local charities), the Eagle-Star Technology Corridor (ESTech), Eagle is Open for Business, Beautify Downtown Eagle, Eagle Economic Development Committee, Eagle Country Christmas, and Eagle Fun Days. Mary was also part of the Eagle Entrepreneurial Zone (EEZ Street), an Eagle business incubator collaboration between the City and local governmental partners. For her service to the community, Mary received the President’s Award from the Eagle Chamber of Commerce as well as the Eagle Mayor’s Excellence Award.

She was the President of the College of Western Idaho Foundation Board of Directors, is a sustaining member of the Junior League of Boise, and was a past member of both Special Olympics Idaho Board of Directors (Vice-President) and the Education Foundation of the West Ada School District Board of Directors. Mary was a member of the Idaho Power Eastern Treasure Valley Electrical Plan Advisory Committee and was a longtime member of the Boise Metro Chamber of Commerce Transportation Committee, as well as the Boise Valley Economic Partnership (BVEP) Working Group. She spearheaded the Central Valley Expressway Coalition (Highway 16 Extension Project), a grassroots coalition designed to highlight the importance of transportation infrastructure improvements and increased funding, as well as to coalesce public support behind these improvements. In 2023, she received a gubernatorial appointment from Governor Brad Little to serve as the community representative on the State of Idaho’s Real Estate Appraiser Board.

 Mary was an Ada County Highway District Commissioner (2019-2023, representing sub-district 3 which encompasses portions of Boise, Garden City, Eagle, Star, along with unincorporated Ada County, stretching from downtown Boise west to the county line at Can-Ada Road). While at ACHD, she served as 1st Vice-President in 2019, and as President of the Commission in both 2020 and 2022. 

Mary previously represented ACHD on the Community Planning Association of Southwest Idaho (COMPASS) Board of Directors (2019-2023), which is comprised of elected officials throughout the Treasure Valley, as well as the COMPASS Executive Committee (2019-2023). She currently represents the City of Eagle on both the COMPASS Board of Directors and the COMPASS Executive Committee (2024-present).

 Mary was honored to be elected by her peers to represent COMPASS on the National Association of Regional Councils (NARC), representing District XII (which encompasses Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming). NARC focuses on transportation, economic development, and public safety, among other issues. Mary previously served on the Ada City-County Emergency Management (ACCEM) Executive Council, and is the current alternate representing the City of Eagle. In 2020, Mary was the recipient of the COMPASS Leadership in Motion Award in the *“Leadership by Example – Elected Official”* category, noting “May’s passion for excellence in collaborative regional transportation planning, project and budget execution strategies, and transportation innovations have produced one consistent result: success in the most challenging of times.”

 Mary has two adult children: Molly (B.A. and M.A., Boise State University), and Matthew (B.A., M.P.A., and Ph.D., Boise State University).
