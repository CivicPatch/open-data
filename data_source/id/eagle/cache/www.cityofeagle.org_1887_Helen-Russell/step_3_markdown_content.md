## Biography

Helen Russell grew up and lived in Southern California up until her move to Eagle in 2015. Her first visit to Eagle in 2006, with husband Jeff, was to search for a community and neighborhood to be her “forever” home.  Jeff had attended Idaho State University years ago and Idaho topped the list for retirement relocation.  After many more visits, their move to Eagle was finalized in 2015 and they became Idahoans for life.

Her professional background includes 20+ years in Human Resource Management, serving in a corporate capacity for Sunkist and Caterpillar.  

Implementing systems for corporate efficiency during those 20+ years led her to start her own consulting business.  She partnered with an HR/Payroll software company and provided software implementation services with clients that included major cruise lines, municipalities, construction management and engineering firms.

Retiring here, she spent the first few years exploring Idaho, learning what can grow in a vegetable garden and helping her extended family relocate here. 

Her love for Eagle and wanting to serve her community led her to become an active participant in city meetings, open houses and surveys. She believes active participation is the key to being informed with facts and being able to affect change.  She encourages neighbors and those she meets to be a part of the process.   

With the tremendous growth in Eagle, Helen believes we must have a long-term vision and be proactive in planning.  She is committed to helping keep Eagle exceptional as we grow, and to maintain the values that made her choose Eagle as home.
