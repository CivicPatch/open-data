## A Message From The Mayor

The City of American Falls is a fantastic community located in Southeastern Idaho. We are home to 4,428 residents. It’s difficult for me to choose what the best thing is about visiting or living in American Falls.

We have beautiful parks, the best 9 hole golf course in Idaho, the American Falls Reservoir which holds over one million acre feet of water for boating and recreation, and, below the dam, the Snake River offers phenomenal fishing. We have excellent schools, a beautiful library, friendly business owners, great restaurants, camping accommodations, the Power County Museum, several church denominations, and we are in close proximity to many historical sights along the Oregon Trail. There are also premier bird watching opportunities, a state fish hatchery located along the river, and a bike and walking path around Willow Bay Recreation Area.

Pocatello regional airport is located 15 miles east of our City. We are centrally located between many tourist areas. We are two and one-half hours drive from Sun Valley, Idaho; Jackson Hole, Wyoming; Yellowstone National Park; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Boise, Idaho. We hope that you are able to stop and enjoy some of the many opportunities available for you and your family!

### Our Mission Statement:

#### *Provide and friendly, diverse, and positive atmosphere for the citizens of American Falls while creating community pride and growth opportunities for all.*
