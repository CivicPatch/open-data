### Councilmember Amy Evans

![](https://www.cdaid.org/files/Administration/Evans2016.jpg)A community activist with boundless energy and a strong commitment to promoting healthy growth while preserving the quality of life in Coeur d'Alene, Amy Evans has spent countless hours over the years dedicating her talents to a wide variety of local causes.

She served six years on the city's Planning Commission, was an integral part of a team of volunteers who helped save a historic downtown elementary school, and was a key player in a membership drive that attracted more than 16,000 people to the Lake City's Kroc Community Center.

Amy is well known for her tireless efforts on community projects and dedication to education, with two children of her own attending Coeur d'Alene public schools.

She brings that same enthusiasm and focus to the Coeur d'Alene City Council, a position she pursued because of her passion to help shape a vibrant future. Amy is steadfast in her commitment to creating good jobs, supporting a top-rate educational system, and providing optimum recreational opportunities.

Amy is a native of Lewiston, Idaho.  She met her husband, Doug, while attending Idaho State University.  Amy and Doug have been married for 20 years and have two children, Max and Lucy.  She is currently employed as the Vice President of Idaho Youth Ranch in Coeur d'Alene.
