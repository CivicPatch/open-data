## Meet the Mayor

Whether you are here visiting for the first time, or you are returning to Mountain Home, I want to welcome you to our thriving community. Our lifestyle in Mountain Home has almost every conceivable recreational activity from fishing, hunting, boating and camping to snowmobiling and skiing (water and snow) available just minutes away in every direction. Mountain Home is an excellent place to live, work and play with a genuine sense of community.

The City of Mountain Home works hard to make doing business here as easy as possible. We offer many incentives, such as a simple, fast permitting process and easy access to community leaders and elected officials, to make our city the right choice for your business. We work hard to keep the lines of communications open and to make Mountain Home friendly to businesses of all sizes. While we are in close proximity to larger cities we keep the small town feel that our families know and love. We have unlimited recreation opportunities with 25 parks totaling over 140 acres. The City offers over 100 youth and adult recreational activities every year to our citizens. We are a hop, skip and a jump from world class water sports, snow sports, camping and hunting. The great outdoors really is our backyard! Mountain Home offers the best of both worlds, close proximity to major metropolitan areas, interstates and air transportation, with the personalized care that only a smaller community can offer. We have highlighted a few of the properties in our City that would be ideal for your company and we welcome the opportunity to host a site visit with you.
