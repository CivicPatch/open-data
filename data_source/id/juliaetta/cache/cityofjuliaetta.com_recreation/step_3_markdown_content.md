**Juliaetta Centennial Park**

Juliaetta Centennial Park was completed in 1996 after years of dedicated effort by citizens of the Juliaetta community. The park features both a baseball field and a softball field with lights and covered dugouts, year-round accessible restrooms, a playground, and a picnic pavilion. The pavilion can be reserved through City Hall for private events, though the rest of the park remains open to the public. A scenic pond borders the entrance to the park and the beginning of the Ed Corkill Memorial Trail. The grounds are maintained and beautified by dedicated community members and City personnel. Community events are held at the park, including the Blackberry Festival and Car Show each September.

**Ed Corkill Memorial Trail**

The Ed Corkill Memorial Trail was created under the Rails-to-Trails program. It’s a bicycling/walking path of nearly 5.5 miles in length. The path links the cities of Juliaetta and Kendrick following along the Potlatch River. More information can be found at [https://www.traillink.com/trail/ed-corkill-memorial-river-trail/](https://www.traillink.com/trail/ed-corkill-memorial-river-trail)
