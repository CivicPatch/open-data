INTRODUCTION

This comprehensive plan is intended as a guide for the future development of Juliaetta and Kendrick. The basis of this plan is a land use element which reflects the community’s desire for the future location of different land uses: residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, and recreational. The map showing the land use plan was based upon existing land use and the policies, goals, and objectives of both cities.

This report represents the consolidation of public policies and objectives regarding housing, commercial development, industrial growth, and agricultural pursuits. The implementation of these guidelines should create a better environment in which to live for all residents of the community.

This plan seeks to initiate positive change, for Juliaetta and Kendrick have many characteristics which should be retained. The charm of the community stems from its agricultural background and its predominantly rural character which are important to local citizens. The general goal of this report is to meet the needs of the future while retaining the desirable elements of the present community.

MAPS

The zoning maps of Kendrick and Juliaetta that have been previously accepted which are marked ” “Terry T. Golding 1/18/96″ ” and marked with his seal with the words ” “Terry T. Golding, Professional Land Surveyor, Registered State of Idaho 7379″ ” shall continue to be used by this 2009 comprehensive plan to define zoning districts.

HISTORY

Juliaetta was founded as an agricultural community around 1878, and the first commercial establishment was opened in 1882. Charles Snyder, a pioneer rancher in the area, managed to have a post office placed on his farm and named it Juliaetta after his daughters, Julia and Etta. Mr. Snyder later moved to the present town site, and the name Juliaetta was transferred to the village. Juliaetta was incorporated on April 19, 1892, and had grown into a thriving community of 500 people by 1903.

Thomas Kirby started Kendrick in 1889 under the name Latah City. On May 24, 1889, the post office was established and Kirby became the first postmaster, operating a drugstore in a one and a half story building with the post office in the rear. From that time, the town was often referred to as Kirby. After Kirby platted the town on May 8, 1890, it became incorporated October 15 of that year.

With assurance that the Northern Pacific Railroad would be built by January 1, 1891, Kirby gave the railroad a deed to half the town site consisting of 240 acres and renamed the town Kendrick in honor of the chief Northern Pacific Railroad engineer, James P. Kendrick.

Much of Kendrick was destroyed by a fire in August of 1893, businesses, including the post office were engulfed. Three months later there were nine brick buildings constructed. In August of 1904, another fire destroyed five blocks with 43 businesses and 19 private homes. Following the second fire, the town passed an ordinance requiring that buildings in the business district be constructed of brick with firewalls between structures. Within a year, 20 brick buildings were erected.

A narrow, confined river valley with steep canyon walls characterizes the City of Kendrick. The Potlatch River drainage and its steeply sloping tributary, Bear Creek, dissect the regional plateau area. Flooding has had a direct impact on the lower elevations where the business and minor residential districts are located.

EXISTING LAND USE

During its early history it was necessary for the Community to supply local residents with all of their needs, but the growth of larger cities and improved transportation changed the nature of demand. The businesses that are operating in the community serve mainly the day-to-day needs of local citizens and are confined to the downtown areas along State Highway 3.

The railroad has had a large impact on the community over the years. The railroad served as both a transportation corridor and as the first line of defense against flooding by the Potlatch River. Over the years the rail bed has served less as transportation and more as a flood control measure. The rail bed acts as a dike, which protects some of the lower lying sections of the community from seasonal floodwaters.

The existing railway right of way has been enhanced, since the abandonment and has been recreated into a walking biking path connecting both cities with the Centennial Park in Juliaetta being that city’s trailhead and the bridge at the mouth of Little Bear Creek being the City of Kendrick’s trailhead.

The present inventory of business establishments in Juliaetta includes a grocery store with laundromat facilities, car wash, and gas pumps, a cut-stock mill, insurance office, a pizza parlor, a tavern, two attorney’s offices, and Manufactured home business.

The ” “old mill yard” ” that represents a sizable area of industrial land that is located in Juliaetta between State Highway 3 and the old Northern Pacific Railroad had been left vacant since 1996 for a number of years. There is now a pole peeling yard for Stella Jones. renting the area. The cut stock lumber mill covers a sizable area and is also located on the south side of town along the highway. These two companies and the agricultural warehouses and processing plants take up much of the industrial land.

The present inventory of businesses in Kendrick includes 2 accountants, a bank, a credit union, one bulk oil plant with card operating pumps, automotive part and repair store, auto repair shop, 1 insurance office, medical clinic, dentist, grocery store, telephone company, two cafes, drug store, liquor store, antique store, dry goods store, pea processing plant, fertilizer plant, second-hand store, gift shop, and the state highway maintenance shop. .

The largest single land use is for residential purposes. Most of the residential area is located on the valley slopes overlooking the commercial and industrial areas. Residential uses are not as dependent upon level land as are commercial and industrial ventures. The community has limited vacant land in the midst of the residential areas, which could be developed for future home sites.

Juliaetta has the elementary school (grades 1-7). A gymnasium was added to the elementary school in 1985. The multi-purpose room and more classrooms were added in 1996. Other community facilities include two small city parks, the Centennial Park, city hall, fire hall, four churches, public library, post office, cemetery, and a museum known as ” “The Castle” “.

Kendrick has the high school (grades 7-12). A major addition was completed in 1996. Other community facilities include three parks, public swimming pool, city hall, fire station, VFW hall, Grange Building, Senior Center, two churches, post office, cemetery, a RV dump, and a RV Park..

THE PLAN

Growth and development are desirable elements only when controlled and channeled into an orderly course of development. Comprehensive planning is the most efficient tool for achieving this control. Land use is the key element in any plan for it is synonymous with growth and change.

The purpose of the plan is to assure sites suitable for building purposes and human habitation, to assist orderly, efficient, integrated and harmonious development of the area, to coordinate proposed streets with existing streets or other proposed streets or features of the area, and to provide adequate open spaces for traffic, recreation, and the proper distribution of the population. The two cities compliment each other very well to provide all desired elements needed by their residents. Land is designated for different uses, including residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural.

The allocation of land was based upon existing land use, land capability, the capacity of existing and planned community facilities, and the expressed desires of local citizens.

GENERAL POLICIES

Policies as stated in the plan indicate very general recommended directions for the planning area. The elements of the plan, including land use, are based as much as possible on policies established by the community. Goals and objectives, which represent recommended actions, must conform to policy. The Kendrick-Juliaetta Planning and Zoning Commission recommends the following policies:  
That the cities adopt and keep an up-to-date comprehensive plan for the area..  
That comprehensive zoning ordinances be maintained as a means of implementing and enforcing the communities plan.  
That the Kendrick-Juliaetta Planning and Zoning Commission coordinate with: Latah County Planning Commission, Nez Perce County Planning Commission, and other planning bodies in all phases of local development that are of common concern.  
That the communities maintain subdivision regulation ordinances to guide and control the platting of lands within the community and to develop a policy regarding development of land adjacent to their corporate limits.  
That adopted planning and zoning ordinances be managed in such a manner so as to maintain the communities’ character and quality of life.  
That growth and development be allowed to proceed at a rate compatible with the community’s ability to provide adequate infrastructure.  
Owners of properties or structures of special and/or historical significance should be encouraged to maintain and/or develop them in a manner consistent with their origins.

AGRICULTURE

There are some areas within and adjacent to the city boundaries that are currently being used for agriculture activity. These areas help create a rural atmosphere and low population density.

The K-J Planning and Zoning Commission recommends the following goals and objectives for agricultural activity: Recognize that agriculture and forested areas are compatible uses within the community. Subject agricultural and forestry uses to E.P.A. standards along with space and distance requirements in order to protect the health and welfare of the community.

COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT

The commercial district of the Community is located along Highway 3 in the centers of both towns and it is recommended that this existing pattern be reinforced in the future. Businesses along the highway will be able to attract trade from passing motorists as well as local residents. The entire community will be more pleasant and efficient if the town center is compact and well organized. The present population of the Community will support little more than those activities selling day to day needs; but it will not take a very large percentage increase to merit additional commercial activity. Planning now, will avoid difficulty in the future.

The K-J Planning and Zoning Commission recommends the following goals and objectives for commercial development.  
Keep commercial development in specific areas along State Highway 3.  
Develop an advertising regulation to control commercial signs and billboards.  
Require new commercial buildings to provide off street parking.

FLOOD PLAIN DEVELOPMENT

Some areas within the Community are subject to flooding from the Potlatch River. This was brought to the forefront in the spring of 1996 when snow pack and subsequent rains caused extensive flooding in the Juliaetta-Kendrick area. Since extensive development within this flood prone area could result in future property damage and/or loss of life, buildings should be regulated and restricted

Both the cities of Juliaetta and Kendrick have joined the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). This will impose regulations and restrictions on development within the limits of the flood plain.

The following goal and objectives will help promote the welfare of local citizens through flood plain planning: Restrict flood prone areas to uses that are not vulnerable to flood damage. Identify and implement improvements necessary to prevent flood damage to life and property.

HOUSING

The areas of the community, which are presently devoted to residential uses, have been included in the residential land use category. It is recommended that these and adjacent areas shown on the land use plan, be restricted to residential and related uses. Home-based businesses are normally permitted in residential areas subject to regulations, which minimize conflict with neighbors. A standard limitation on home occupations is that they take up no more than 50 percent of the dwelling.

It would be wise for the community to strive to preserve the uncrowded nature of its residential areas. Appropriate zoning districts have been established to preserve the existing housing densities in established residential districts and plan for future areas of growth. Adequate standards have been adopted for building and improvement setbacks, lot size, building heights, fencing, screening and/or landscaping, etc.

The 2000 census shows that of the 153 occupied housing units in Kendrick 117 are owner occupied (76.5%). Of these 95 were single family dwellings. The average cost of the dwellings was $86,000 while the national average was $119,000. The same census shows that Juliaetta had a total of 255 occupied housing units of which 201 (78.8%) were owner occupied. Of these 130 were single family homes. The average cost was $88,200.

The quality of housing in the community is good. Each city has adopted the Uniform Building Code. Most of the manufactured homes are used as fixed housing and rarely, if ever moved. However, Mobile homes still require special consideration, minimum standards for health, sanitation, and safety. Spacing standards for distance between units are especially important, for overcrowding has been a traditional problem in mobile home and RV parks. Park owners should be encouraged to create an attractive setting through landscaping and property upkeep. Screening systems of trees and shrubs add greatly to the privacy and attractiveness of mobile home and RV Parks.

Based on the housing factors discussed above, the K-J Planning and Zoning Commission recommends the following housing goals and objectives:  
Designate specified areas of the community for residential and compatible uses.  
Allow agricultural land uses in residential areas subject to standards of health and safety.  
Maintain standards and guidelines for lot size and design, which are adequate to avoid creating, crowded residential areas.  
Maintain standards and guidelines for mobile home and RV parks.  
Maintain and enforce codes, standards and guidelines governing housing construction and maintenance.

INDUSTRIALIZATION

Industry has the ability to generate many jobs and large amounts of capital, and in most community’s prosperity can be related to employment opportunities. The location of a new industrial facility would have a tremendous economic impact, but there are certain industrial limitations, which must be considered. Much of the Communities existence is due to its appeal as a residential community and only the non-polluting industries would be desirable.

The K-J Planning and Zoning Commission recommends the following goals and objectives for industrialization:  
Reserve some land for industrial use but consider specific proposals for development on an individual basis.  
Encourage environmentally friendly industry to locate in the communities in order to provide job opportunities and preserve the quality of life in both cities.

LAND USE

The K-J Planning and Zoning Commission recommends the following goals and objectives for land use:  
The cities maintain rules, regulations, standards and guidelines regarding the subdivisions, development and improvements of land.  
Require all new community development to be served by public water and sewer.  
In the case of land subdivision and development the cost of extending utilities shall be the responsibility of the sub divider.

POPULATION, GROWTH AND EMPLOYMENT

The US 2000 Census shows that both cities are almost exactly at the national average of per cent of people over 18 (74%). However, both cities have large numbers of older citizens. Juliaetta had 105 (17.2%) over 65 while Kendrick had 66 (17.9%) over 65 years. The national average is 12.4% Plans for the communities should take into consideration the needs of an aging population including recreation, economics, and social.

Juliaetta with 398 people 25 years and over in the work force had 330 (82.9%) with a high school or higher education. Kendrick with 252 people 25 or over in the wok force had 215 (85.3%) with high school or higher education. The national average is 80.4%. Thos with a Bachelor’s degree or higher were 41 (10.3%) people in Juliaetta and 45 (17.9%) in Kendrick with a national average being 24.4%.

This aging population is reflected in the median household incomes of $33,295 in Juliaetta and $31,000 in Kendrick. The national average is $41,994. There were 7(4.2%) families living below the poverty level in Juliaetta and 11 (11.2%) families in Kendrick. The national average was 9.2%. Individuals below the poverty level in Juliaetta numbered 72 (12.3%) and in Kendrick 47 (11.8%) while the national average was 12.4%.

An important factor affecting population growth on a long-term basis is Juliaetta and Kendrick’s residential appeal for individuals employed in Lewiston and Moscow. The small town atmosphere of the community tends to justify commuting for workers disenchanted with a growing urban area. The Community’s ability to attract residents who commute to work and retired citizens will largely determine the future population growth rate. The availability of employment opportunities in adjacent urban areas will also influence the community’s population growth rate.

PUBLIC FACILITIES, SERVICES, and UTILITIES

The welfare of a community depends to a large extent upon its ability to provide public services to local citizens. Growth must be paralleled by an expansion of public facilities if a given community is to remain an attractive and safe place in which to live. Adequate water and sewer systems, fire protection, emergency services, and schools are especially important to any town.

Juliaetta and Kendrick both now have 2 fire trucks each plus share a 6 x6 and a brush truck. The cities have made mutual aid agreements with fire departments from surrounding areas.

Juliaetta had a new surface water treatment facility completed in June 1993. This facility should provide the City of Juliaetta with adequate water supply for some years. Water for the City of Juliaetta is supplied by four wells and the river also. The City of Juliaetta upgraded their water system in 2004 by replacing water mains in almost all streets with 6″ lines, building two water reservoirs that hold enough water for 2 or 3 days use plus enough to fight a major fire, and adding new fire hydrants.

The source for the water treatment plant is the Potlatch River. Multiple sources of water do make for an efficient operation by providing necessary alternative sources.

Juliaetta has a wastewater collection and treatment system installed in 1978. The design life of the plant is 20 years. However, at this time the city is close to exceeding the organic loading capacity of the plant despite the fact that the plant is currently operating at 60% of hydraulic capacity.

Kendrick water is supplied by wells at four locations and one spring..

Kendrick has completed a water project in 2009 with a new 340,000 gallon reservoir replacing the old smaller reservoir, plus a new well. The sewer system is being looked at with modifications of the lagoons being planned in an effort to keep up with EPA standards.

RECREATION

Juliaetta has Centennial Park with ball fields, concession stand, gazebo, and bathroom facilities that is used for community events as well as many ballgames. There are 2 other small parks in town plus the ball field at the Juliaetta Elementary School that is used by the school. The Centennial Park is the Juliaetta trailhead of the bike/walking trail that connects Juliaetta and Kendrick along the old railway right-of-way. Juliaetta has completed a Forest Service Grant which has added more trees and benches along the city’s section of the trail.

Kendrick has the War Memorial swimming Pool, 3 city parks (one at each end of town plus the city park in the middle of town). There is a dump station for residents at one of the parks. The walking trail ends at the bridge by the school.

SCHOOLS

Both the elementary and high school students are adequately housed at the present time. Enrollment is shrinking. The Kendrick High School has just added a new gym and two classrooms.

TRANSPORTATION

Juliaetta and Kendrick are three miles apart and are connected by Highway 3 and the Ed Corkill Memorial Bike Trail which run parallel to the river. The Corkill Bike Trail is 5.3 miles long and is built on the old railroad bed. It has a smooth asphalt surface.

Currently there is no public transit system between Kendrick and Juliaetta or connecting them to Moscow or Lewiston. There are also no commercial airport facilities in the towns. The nearest airports are in Lewiston and Moscow.

Highway 3 is a major north south highway running through both towns with much use by logging and other heavy commercial trucks as well as by large recreational vehicles in addition to the local traffic.

Due to the steep hillsides about the only place that bicycles are used is the trail connecting the two cities.

The Kendrick Juliaetta Joint Transportation Plan done by J. P. Stravens in 2007 shows that both cities did a complete road and sign inventory in 2007. These show the widths of the streets in many cases as being 60′ or 80′ wide.

Some of the roads are cul-de-sacs and /or difficult to get to because of the terrain and lack of planning in the past. This can make it difficult for emergency vehicles to find a location. All building lots should have frontage on an accepted city street.

Recommendations

It would be useful to bring the width of the streets in both cities into agreement with each city’s streets ordinance. They are supposed to be 50 feet wide in residential areas. This would be most useful for the Planning and Zoning Commission when having to make recommendations as well as being useful for the cities when deciding where sidewalks and signs are supposed to be located.

Future building in the cities and surrounding areas should take into consideration the future flow of traffic and have an overall plan for where roads ought to go for ease in getting around the towns. Proper planning should help avoid flag lots and make for a free flow of traffic in the future.

STORM WATER MANAGEMENT

Currently the storm water is allowed to run down the hillsides and roads to the river with culverts and drains to guide it where possible. With increased building on the higher ground, there is an increase in the amount running off which has caused problems.

Recommendations

All new building in the cities and the areas of impact should take storm water management into consideration and have engineered means of containing the run off on site whether by swales, dry wells, or another means or integrating it into the current city plan with out causing erosion or other damage. A storm water management plan should be developed for each city

CLOSING STATEMENT

It was and is the intent of the Kendrick-Juliaetta Planning and Zoning Commission to develop goals, objectives, and guidelines to assist the Community in its future growth and prosperity without losing touch with its roots and character. We believe this ” “Comprehensive Plan” ” is encompassing enough to cover issues of ” “Public Good” ” as well as address the concerns of the governing bodies without being unduly or unfairly restrictive to its individual residents. As was stated before, this is an on-going report. We cannot possibly know all of the answers, but hopefully have made a step in the right direction towards this Communities’ future.
