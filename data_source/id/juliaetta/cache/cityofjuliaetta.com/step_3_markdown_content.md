## Welcome to Juliaetta!

The quiet community of Juliaetta is located in north central Idaho at the southern edge of Latah County nestled in the Potlatch River valley. It was originally called Schupferville for Rupert Schupfer, and original homesteader of the area. The town was renamed in 1882 by the first postmaster, Charles Snyder, for his daughters Julia and Etta. The city was incorporated in 1892 when the railroad was extended here. Juliaetta has a population of 624, and being situated 27 miles from Moscow, Idaho and 23 miles from Lewiston, Idaho, makes it a comfortable commuting distance for residents working in those cities. Juliaetta is in the Kendrick Joint School District; the Elementary School is located in Juliaetta while Kendrick Jr.-Sr. High School in neighboring Kendrick, Idaho serves high school age kids. Local industries include farming and logging, as well as nearby wineries, paper products manufactuing, and digital products and systems manufacturing.
