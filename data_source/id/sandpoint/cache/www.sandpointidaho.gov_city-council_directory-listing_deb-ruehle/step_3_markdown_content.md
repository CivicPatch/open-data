Profile

Appointed 2014, elected 2015 and re-elected 2019 and 2023 (current 4-year term beginning Jan 2024)

Deb was born and raised near Detroit, Michigan, and arrived in Sandpoint in April of 2004. She has two sons, both born at BGH. She earned her Bachelor’s degree in 1990 from the University of Colorado, Boulder Colorado. She spent a short time as a Level III Adaptive Ski Instructor and a research assistant before earning her Master’s degree in Physical Therapy in 1995 from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. She believes one of the most important things she ever learned was from the director of her PT program at Emory, who said, “We must all learn to disagree agreeably,” or no forward progress will ever be made. Deb has traveled to every state in the union except Alaska, following her athletic and academic dreams, and has lived in nine of them, from cities as big as Los Angles, California, to tiny Fayetteville, West Virginia. Deb fell in love with Sandpoint’s small town character and its big heart, with its diverse and eclectic inclusion of all persons, and decided there would be no place better to raise a family. Deb is an involved community member and volunteer, participating with many nonprofit organizations: Team Autism 24/7 RAAM crew, 24 Hours for Hank Cystinosis Project, Independence Alpine Ski Racing Team, Pend d’Oreille Bay Trail, Sandpoint Nordic Club, Sandpoint Community Review participant 2013. Deb was also a member of the Sandpoint Planning and Zoning Commission for three years. Deb acknowledges that, when you are a therapist, you get to know people, and, when you travel a lot, you get to know places and the things that make them livable with longevity. She feels these experiences, along with her knowledge regarding judicial procedures and the City’s new comprehensive plan, acquired during her time as a P&amp;Z Commissioner, allow her to make a meaningful and thoughtful contribution back to the community of Sandpoint.
