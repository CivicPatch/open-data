Profile

Elected 2023 (4-year term beginning Jan 2024)

Pam was born in Florida, raised in Maryland and following wanderlust finally found “home” in 1983 on 20 acres in West Bonner County. While homesteading there and raising 2 children, she worked seasonally in our area forests that she loves.  Employment at Schweitzer Mountain supported a love of skiing and winter income.   

Following another lifestyle change and desire to continue her education, Pam bought a home in Priest River.  In 1998 she acquired dual degrees in Education from the U of I,  commuting to the Coeur d’Alene campus.  She taught in Priest River, the Alaskan bush, Stanley, and Ketchum, ID, and retired in 2019.  Pam always maintained a home in Bonner County spending summers off school here kayaking, gardening, hiking, and backpacking.  She feels fortunate to have a home in Sandpoint and enjoys having her daughter, son, and grandchildren living in the area. 

Pam is a member volunteer with KRFY Community Radio, Kinnikinnick Native Plant Society’s Ed Committee, ICL’s Lake Pend Oreille Water Quality Monitoring, Priest River Watershed Steering Committee, N. Idaho Chapter of Great Old Broads for Wilderness, Idaho Trails Association, and serves as Board Secretary for the Selkirk Conservation Alliance.

Because of her love for Sandpoint she heeded the call, “If you want to make a difference, run for office!” Honored to now serve as a city councilor, Pam looks forward to helping the community come together for the common good while working through our “growing pains,” preserving our natural resources, and “Keeping Sandpoint Real!”
