Profile

## **Elected 2021 (4-year term beginning Jan 2022)**

Born in Wisconsin, Justin Dick grew up in Denver, Colorado where he remained until graduating from high school. An avid football player, Justin was selected First Team All-State and First Team All-Conference at Cherry Creek High School in Greenwood Village, Colorado which earned him a full-ride scholarship to Idaho State University in Pocatello, Idaho.  It was there he met his future wife, Shaunavee.

After attending and playing for three years at Idaho State University, Justin and Shaunavee transferred to the University of Colorado in Denver where Justin chose to focus on his academics and begin his life with Shaunavee.

Justin graduated with honors from the University of Colorado in Denver with a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology. Upon graduation, Justin worked for the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center at the Children’s Eating Laboratory, which at the time was only one of three of its kind in the country. His work involved studies related to mealtime with daycare providers in the Denver area. He also worked closely with the University of Idaho and the University of Nevada.

For several years, Justin and Shaunavee vacationed in North Idaho and fell in love with the area. They took the leap of faith and moved here in 2006. Their first jobs where at Café Trinity and The 219 Lounge where they assisted Justin’s parents, Mel and Claudia with the operation of the businesses.  

In 2009, Justin and Shaunavee opened Trinity at City Beach in its current location at the Best Western Edgewater. In 2014, Justin purchased and co-owns Jalapenos Mexican Restaurant, and his latest endeavor is the purchase and recent opening of the 113 Main – the former Truby’s – on the corner of Second Avenue and Main.

Justin is an active member of the community, partnering with several nonprofits in the area on various causes.  He is the President of the Bonner General Health Foundation and has served on the Visit Sandpoint Tourism Council for over a decade. Justin is also a Rotarian and is a former Board member for Sandpoint Chamber of Commerce.

As a business owner and as the parent of two children,  Justin has a passion for doing what he can to make Sandpoint a wonderful place and says it is a pleasure to serve this community and its residents!
