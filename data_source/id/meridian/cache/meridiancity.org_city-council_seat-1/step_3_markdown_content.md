## City Council Member

## Brian Whitlock

With over 30 years of communications, government, public relations and management experience in Idaho and Washington DC, Brian Whitlock has had an insider’s view of how government works, and operational experience of the impact policymakers have.

 

Today, Brian serves at the President and CEO of the Idaho Hospital Association, speaking on behalf of Idaho’s community hospitals.  He joined the Association in 2015 and leads a team of dedicated professionals in providing voice, value and visibility to community hospitals. In addition to his responsibilities in creating and supporting sound policies for healthcare at both the state and federal levels, Brian works tirelessly helping evolve our healthcare system to one focused on quality and value for all Idahoans.

 

Prior to joining the Association, Brian was the Director of State and Regional Governmental Affairs for the Idaho National Laboratory – one of Idaho’s largest employers – and advocated for state policies that benefited nearly 4,000 scientists, researchers and engineers in eastern Idaho.

 

Brian’s extensive service, sage advice, and insight on Capitol Hill and in Idaho’s Statehouse have helped him develop strong relationships, making him a trusted advisor to many elected officials and lawmakers. You cannot take too many steps around the Statehouse without someone calling out Brian’s name.

 

He was a trusted advisor, Chief of Staff, and State Budget Director to Governor Dirk Kempthorne, both in Boise and Washington DC. As budget director, he managed the state’s $4 billion budget impacting every Idahoan through hundreds of programs and state agencies.

 

A 1985 graduate of Brigham Young University with a degree in Broadcast Communications, Brian had a short stint as a television reporter in Tri Cities, Washington before becoming the lead reporter for the ABC affiliate in Boise.

 

Brian and his wife Kelly have three children: Alex, married to Jenni; James, recently married to Jessica, and Megan.

 

**Term expires:** January 2026
