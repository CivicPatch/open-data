## City Council

Meridian City Council is an elected body of six representatives for Meridian residents. As local legislators, councilmembers are responsible for and responsive to the citizens who elected them across Meridian's six local districts.

Meridian created these districts in 2022 to comply with state law, and elections by district began with the November 2023 election.
