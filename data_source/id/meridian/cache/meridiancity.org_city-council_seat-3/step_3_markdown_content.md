## City Council Member

## Doug Taylor

Doug’s family roots run deep in Idaho. A fourth generation Idahoan who grew up just outside of Idaho Falls, Doug’s parents owned a small janitorial supply business where Doug spent summers refinishing gym floors and driving a delivery truck. Doug was active in scouting and earned his Eagle Scout rank and was involved in high school sports.

Doug graduated with university honors from Brigham Young University with degrees in English and Business Management. Soon after, Doug and his wife Adele moved to Washington, DC, where Doug enrolled in graduate school at The George Washington University and began his early career focused on public service.

Doug spent five years as an economic and budget policy advisor in the U.S. Senate, three years representing the Idaho National Laboratory in Congress, and almost six years as a Chief of Staff in the U.S. House of Representatives. Doug’s time serving in these roles filled his strong passion to serve and give back to the committee.

In the private sector, Doug has experience working as a commercial real estate agent specializing in multi-family transactions. Today, Doug owns his own consulting firm helping clients navigate the complexities of state government. 

Both Doug and his wife Adele have volunteered with the youth at their church and Doug has coached football and soccer with Meridian Pal and Optimist Football. His community and non-profit service includes time on the steering committee for the Meridian Comprehensive Plan. He also served as President of the Idaho State Society, Finance Chair and precinct committeeman in the Idaho Republican Party, and as a board member of the Idaho Apartment Association.

In 2013 Doug and Adele chose Meridian as their new home because they knew it would be the best place to raise their four children. Their children, ages 9-16, attend school in the West Ada School District and are active in youth sports and community music programs. 

**Term expires:** January 2028
