# Elected Officals

Middleton City operates under the five-member form of government. The elected officials, including the mayor and four city council members, operate as the policy making and legislative authority for the city. They each serve four-year, staggered terms and are elected at large. City Council meetings are regularly scheduled meetings held the first and third Wednesday of each month in the City Council Chambers, beginning at 5:30 p.m. Meetings are open to the public.
