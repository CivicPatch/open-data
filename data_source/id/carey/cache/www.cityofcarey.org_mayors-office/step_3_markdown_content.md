# Mayor's Office

Alyssa Cenarrusa was born in Phoenix, Arizona in April of 1997. After moving multiple times in her early childhood, her family eventually settled in Boise in 2008. Alyssa grew up with an older brother, Joey, younger brother, Larsen, and younger sister, Juliet. She attended Renaissance High School in Meridian, Idaho, where she graduated in 2015 with her high school diploma and an Associate's Degree in General Studies through the Idaho Dual Credit Program. Alyssa went to Boise State University, where she graduated in December 2018 with a Bachelor's Degree in Business Management and Marketing. In the Spring of 2016, Alyssa met her now husband, Caleb Cenarrusa. After graduating college, Alyssa moved to Carey and started a job at the Blaine County Assessor's office. In September 2019, Caleb and Alyssa got married and a year later, they welcomed their son, Cameron Cenarrusa, to the world. Alyssa and Caleb will be welcoming their second son in December 2024.

The Carey area serves many of Alyssa’s hobbies which include shooting, fishing and paddle boarding. She loves spending time with her family, whether by catching up on a new show, playing board games or going on vacation. Alyssa also likes to travel and has been to 8 countries in Europe and multiple states in the U.S., as well as Washington D.C. She is excited to grow her family and continue to help the Carey community.

In April of 2021, Alyssa was appointed to fill a vacant seat on City Council and was elected in November 2021 to serve a four-year term. After a sudden resignation within the City of Carey in April 2024, Alyssa became the interim Mayor. In June 2024 she was voted by the city council to finish the term, which will end in January 2026. Alyssa has been part of the Pioneer Days Committee, A Very Carey Christmas Committee, Carey Clean Up Week and the Carey Parks and Recreation Board. She enjoys spending her time improving her community and planning events to bring people together.
