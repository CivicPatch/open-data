### Council Member

[Email Bryce Blankenship](mailto:bblankenship@ci.moscow.id.us)  
Term expires: 2027

Originally from Kansas City, Bryce moved to Moscow in August of 2011 to attend graduate school at The University of Idaho. He graduated in 2013 with his master's in philosophy and is now a Senior Instructor in the department of Politics and Philosophy at The University of Idaho. He has also worked in various restaurants and businesses on the Palouse including Nectar Restaurant and Wine Bar, The Moscow Wine Company, and currently is a principle bartender at The Black Cypress in Pullman, Washington. When he's not wearing one of his 'professional' hats you can find Bryce outside soaking in the beauty and charm of the Palouse--staying active by cycling and running-- or enjoying a cocktail with pals at many local bars and restaurants. Bryce was elected to a four-year term on City Council in November 2023 and is excited to serve and represent the wonderful community of Moscow.
