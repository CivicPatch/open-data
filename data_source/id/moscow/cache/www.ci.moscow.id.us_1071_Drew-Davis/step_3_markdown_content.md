## Drew Davis

### Council Member

[Email Drew Davis](mailto:ddavis@ci.moscow.id.us)

Term expires: 2027

Drew arrived in Moscow in the Fall of 2012 to attend the University of Idaho, where he studied Architecture. Drew earned his bachelor’s and master’s degree, and participated the study abroad program during his graduate studies, spending a year studying architecture &amp; urbanism in Finland. After graduating, Drew worked at firms around the Pacific Northwest before joining the Knit-Designing Communities Moscow office as a Senior Project Specialist. Drew also remained involved with the University of Idaho College of Art and Architecture, spending the last five years teaching a myriad of courses in architecture and interior design programs. He has spent two years using his experience in architecture to serve the city as a commissioner on the Planning and Zoning Commission for the City of Moscow. When he is not working, you can find him exploring the Pacific Northwest with his wife and four kids on a pair of skis, raft, or bike. Drew is happy to call Moscow home and is honored to serve the city as a member of the Moscow City Council.

Drew was appointed in December 2022 by Mayor Bettge to fill the vacancy by Anne Zabala. He was then elected to a four-year term in November 2023.
