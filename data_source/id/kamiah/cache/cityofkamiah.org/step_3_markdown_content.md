# Welcome to City of Kamiah City of Kamiah... A Place to Call Home!

In the City of Kamiah, we are defined less by boundaries on a map than by the sense of shared values our residents hold dear. Small town values, guided growth, preservation of historical, cultural, and natural heritage are just a few of the core principles that make the City of Kamiah a wonderful place to call home.

## Support Local Animal Shelter

Looking for a furry friend to become a part of your family? Consider adopting a dog or cat from your local animal shelter. An adopted pet will provide unconditional love and companionship to all.

## Conserve Water

It's our most precious natural resource.  Every drop counts...

## Shop Local

Whether it is a local farmer's market or main street shops, shopping local sustains our community and supports local merchants.  A win-win for all!
