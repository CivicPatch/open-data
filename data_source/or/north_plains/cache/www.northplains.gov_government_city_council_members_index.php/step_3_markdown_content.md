## Ariel Goodwin, Mayor

Ariel.goodwin@northplains.gov

## Aaron Dumbrow, City Councilor

Aaron.dumbrow@northplains.gov

I grew up about 5 miles outside Dexter, OR in a small logging community.  We had a general store, a volunteer fire department, and a few other things, but it was a very small town where everyone knew each other.  
After medical retirement from the U.S. Army Military Police, I went to work in Information Technology.  I currently work for Broadcom Technologies in the Software Division as Senior Manager of Solutions Architecture.  My team focuses on pre-sales design supporting the traditional sales functions.  I also run a small home-based gun shop out of my house.  
While not having served on municipal government positions, most of my career has been in leadership roles both in the military and civilian life.  I have also served as the Vice Commander of the American Legion in Hillsboro previously where I learned parliamentary procedure and how to run a board meeting.  
I am a lifelong learner, and I enjoy the challenge of taking on a new role.  The opportunity to work alongside the citizens of North Plains is a growth opportunity that I look forward to as we continue to make North Plains a great place to work and live.  
My wife Cheryl and I have 3 sons, a granddaughter, a grandson on the way this summer, and 2 dogs.  The older two are married one living in Kentucky, and one in Texas.  Our youngest lives in Corvallis currently working at Starbucks and attending college.  We moved to North Plains in 2022 to return to the small-town life and a more walkable community.  
I have always believed that government service is a responsibility.  Growing up in a highly patriotic family, and serving in the Oregon National Guard, and the U.S. Army, I developed a great love for the Constitution and the rule of law.  Serving in law enforcement helped me to understand the need for good people to stand up and take a turn at serving the citizens.    
Thomas Payne said, "Those who expect to reap the blessing of freedom must, like men, undergo the fatigue of supporting it." I choose to serve on the City Council to advocate for our citizens and to represent their interests.  
I am passionate about making sure we maintain the small town feel of North Plains that so many are fond of.  While growth is inevitable, my goal is to seek a balanced plan with local jobs and businesses to serve our citizens; a plan for long term suitability of our infrastructure, and the resources we all want.    
My vision is a walkable downtown we can all enjoy, the right balance of citizen involvement and city employees to keep our city safe, clean, and beautiful; to limit our expansion and protect our critical farmland so that future generations can enjoy the beauty all around us; a place where we drive less, walk more, a place we can call home.  
I am a retired law enforcement officer, having served in the U.S. Army Military Police.  I was medically retired after nearly 9 years due to non-combat injuries.    
My wife and I love camping, riding motorcycles, both on and off road, and we enjoy being able to walk to one of our local food carts or other North Plains establishments to enjoy a meal, a drink, or a treat.  
I am a huge introvert, but I love talking about cool technology and even more, talking about guns.  I shoot pistol competitions, and I always love to talk about gear, or how to improve.    
If you bump into me please come say hi, I am pretty much the same person at home, at church, at work, and out in public.  I have met some amazing people in North Plains, and I would love to hear from you what you like about being here.

## Mandy Hagedorn, City Councilor

Mandy.hagedorn@northplains.gov

I grew up in the heart of Western Washington County, with my roots firmly planted in Hillsboro, and my childhood and schooling in Forest Grove. One of the most influential experiences that shaped my career path came during my high school and college years, working at a local, 50-year family-owned business – Murphy’s Furniture Store in Cornelius, Oregon. This store was more than just a place of business; it was a cornerstone of the community, known for its St. Patrick’s Day Parade and furniture refinishing clinics. It was there that I learned invaluable lessons about entrepreneurship and community, particularly the importance of thinking outside the box, actively listening to customers, and finding creative solutions to challenges – all while working with a modest budget. These early lessons played a pivotal role in shaping my career journey, ultimately leading me to Product Marketing &amp; Management. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work across a variety of industries, developing and bringing new products to market. These include Outdoor Recreation, Forestry, Lawn &amp; Garden, Capital Equipment, and, most recently, Consumer Technology.  
My husband and I were drawn to the North Plains community for its peace, solitude, and the beautiful farmland and nature that surround it. It's less than an hour from our home port in Garibaldi, OR, where we operate our charter business and enjoy various outdoor recreation activities. Having both worked in the city, we decided to make North Plains our home because of its peaceful setting and its close proximity to the activities we love, especially with our 1.5-year-old Wirehaired Pointing Griffon, Smokey.  
I decided to run for North Plains City Council because I believe in the power of listening, empathy, and collaboration to create community-focused solutions. With my experience leading product development teams, I’ve learned that successful outcomes come from open dialogue, sharing ideas, and working together toward common goals. I intend to bring that same approach to our city, where residents feel comfortable and heard by their representatives. And, of course, I believe a little humor goes a long way—working together should be both productive and enjoyable, and I’m committed to bringing that spirit to the City Council.  
I am particularly passionate about two key opportunities in our community: supporting small businesses and expanding the services of our local Food Bank. First, revitalizing downtown North Plains with essential businesses that residents are requesting is a major opportunity. By nurturing the growth and creation of small businesses in the town center, we can not only create jobs but also shape a strong community culture—something that can be easily lost in the face of rapid growth. Another opportunity is providing mentorship and training programs for individuals who want to upskill or start their own businesses, which can empower residents and encourage local entrepreneurship.  
Additionally, I’m deeply passionate about addressing the growing needs of our local food bank. Currently, the North Plains Food Bank serves an estimated 500 individuals, and there is a clear need for expanded services. Everyone deserves a good quality of life, and the Food Bank is doing incredible work to meet this need while also partnering with outlying communities to support one another. Both of these areas—small business growth and food security—are vital to ensuring North Plains remains a thriving and compassionate community.  
Here are a few fun facts about me! I’m currently learning to play guitar with my dad (though, to be honest, we mostly just make noise). I’m completely obsessed with my mischievous puppy, who keeps me on my toes. At home, I have a small flock of chickens. I’m also in the process of collecting parts to restore an original 1970s Honda Monkey Bike. My first job out of college was for Gerber, one of Oregon's oldest knife companies and ever since, I’ve developed a bit of a collection habit!

## Michele McCall-Wallace, City Councilor

I grew up primarily in San Bernardino, California and Arizona. As a young adult I moved to the mountains nearby, then to San Diego and on to San Francisco where I completed my BFA at the Academy of Art College. Here, I met my husband a fellow artist. With a young son and my daughter ‘on the way’, we moved to Northern California in the Eureka-Arcata area so I could attend Humboldt State University for my MA degree.  After many years in Arcata, the family later moved to Blue Lake where I served on the City Council and as Mayor. After developing afterschool arts programs, teaching in the local college and university, coordinating arts exhibitions, running galleries, and raising two children, we moved to Hillsboro in 2017 when I took a position as their Cultural Arts Manager. In March of 2018 my husband and I moved to North Plains.  
My previous experience in government related boards and committees includes Hillsboro Downtown Partnership, Design Committee, January 2019-2022, City of North Plains Budget Committee, 3-Year Appointment, 2018-2021, Mayor, City of Blue Lake, December 2014- January 2017, Blue Lake City Council, elected 2008-2012, reappointment April 2014- Jan. 2017, Humboldt County Assoc. of Governments (HACOG), Board Member 2008-2012, 2014-2016, I have also served on many cultural arts and education boards and commissions not listed here.  
At the end of December 2023, I retired from my position as Cultural Arts Manager for the City of Hillsboro. Now free of regular work obligations, I welcomed the opportunity to participate in my local community in a more meaningful way and to utilize my experience in service to North Plains. Given my education, experience, and continued interest in collaborative, inclusive, thoughtful, and intentional leadership, I believe serving on the City Council is an ideal way for me to best serve my community.  
The community of North Pains has experienced some recent growing pains and I believe is at the tipping point to move into the next steps of becoming a more inclusive, livable city for all of it’s residents. I think some of the ways to do this would include continuing to address developing a more vibrant and active downtown, enhancing local business areas and public spaces, creatively securing additional resources and revenue for services throughout the City, strategically planning for smart growth and sustainability, improving communication, and actively encouraging and engaging it’s citizens involvement and pride in all that the City does. I am excited to help make this happen as a City Councilor.  
I make art. Sometimes it’s the kind of thing you see hanging on walls or a crafted object, and other times it’s the weird conceptual kind of stuff you see in museums.  
I have had the opportunity since I was a child to live in communities of all sizes and types- outside a small (but largest around) town of less than 300 to the heavily populated and building rich, City of San Francisco. As such, I have experienced rural living, small towns with a collective neighborhood, mid-sized communities, suburban developments, and urban and metropolitan cities. I think it has given me an interesting perspective and understanding of how the many ways we live.

## Trista Papen, City Councilor

Trista Papen was appointed to City Council in November 2019 to fill a vacancy left by a departing member and was elected in 2022 for a full 4-year term. That term expires December 31st 2026.  Trista and her family have lived in North Plains for about 9 years during which time she has been a member of her HOA, a member of the North Plains Steering/Vision Committee and prior to being appointed to City Council was a member of the current North Plains Budget Committee.  Some of the most important issues that Trista feels North Plains is facing right now are growth, economic development, expanding the Urban Growth Boundary, and the opening of the new elementary school.

## Katie Reding, City Councilor

Katie.reding@northplains.gov

I am a North Plains native—born and raised in the Mountaindale valley. I absolutely *love* the City of North Plains! Living in our small town brings me comfort—knowing I have close connections with many neighbors, a wonderful police chief who genuinely cares about the community, officers who frequently patrol by my house, and the peaceful farmland surrounding us that offers a sense of grounding in our hectic world.   
Before becoming a full-time mom, I worked as a bank teller at West Coast Bank, a Team Lead at Target, a checker at Costco, and a farmhand. I believe experiencing a variety of jobs teaches invaluable lessons and broadens your perspective. This diverse background allows me to approach challenges with greater insight and understanding.  
As the Chief Petitioner for Measure 34-327, I played a key role in bringing the UGB expansion to the ballot in North Plains. While I haven’t held an official government position, I offer a deeply personal perspective shaped by my journey as a medically fragile mom who became an expert in my child’s rare condition. As a volunteer city councilor, I am committed to learning all I can to serve our community. My heart is fully invested in making North Plains a remarkable place for my children, friends, family, and all who call it home.  
I am a full-time mom and care coordinator for my three children, one of whom has special needs and makes our lives fuller. I have been married for 15 years to my wonderful husband.  
I have a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Oregon State University, with a minor in Health Behavior.   
My purpose for running for City Council is to see a city that my children can live in years from now. One that is safe, has amenities, and they can still live within their means to do so. I believe North Plains stands on a precipice to be a model city that listens to its constituents and grows in a way that protects our farmland, provides a path for future planned growth, and makes smart choices for industries we bring in for jobs for our community. I want open communication with my community and for engagement to happen at council meetings that leads to even better ideas.  
I am deeply passionate about supporting our youth by providing opportunities for fun, growth, learning, and valuable experiences. They are the future of our city, and I hope to inspire native North Plains kids to return with a passion for leading or serving their community. I also care greatly about our senior citizens, ensuring they have access to essential care, pharmacies, transportation, affordable housing, and groceries.  
I enjoy hunting and camping with my family and friends, and I get a kick out of scoring bargain deals while shopping—it’s my kind of thrill! I have a soft spot for the color pink, and glitter is always a win in my book. During the COVID sourdough craze, I discovered a love for baking and now enjoy whipping up delicious treats for friends and family. You’ll often find me out walking with my kids or playing at Jesse Mays—feel free to stop by and say hi!
