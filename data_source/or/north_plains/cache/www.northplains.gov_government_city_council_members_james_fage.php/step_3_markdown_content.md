## James Fage

James Fage was first elected to City Council November 2018. He was re-elected in 2022 and his current term expires December 31st 2026. Previous to being elected to City Council James served as a North Plains Planning Commissioner. James and his wife Danielle both work at Intel Corporation. They moved to North Plains because the small town feel and the proximity to work. The small town aspect was desired as it provides a good environment to raise his family.

James has two children, Ashton and Montana. Montana attends North Plains elementary and Ashton will be attending North Plains Elementary once he is old enough for Kindergarten. Montana aspires to earn her black belt in karate while Ashton aspires to be a Super Hero, preferably one who flies. James relaxes by playing with his children and tinkering with various small projects around the house.

James is a lifelong learner who enjoys a variety of subjects. James earned a Master’s of Science in Management and Leadership (MSML), Masters in Business Administration (MBA), Bachelors of Science in Business Management from Western Governors University, Associates in Administration of Justice from Ohlone College, Associates in General Education from Mission College and Project Management Professional certification from CompTIA. James is an Eagle Scout.

Councilor Fage was elected in November, 2018 and his current term expires December 31, 2026. His email is [james.fage@northplains.gov](mailto:james.fage@northplains.org).

Read a Q&amp;A below with Councilor Fage to learn more about why he serves on Council, what City accomplishment he is proud of, what he's most passionate about in the community, and more.  
Meet Your Council: Councilor James FageJames Fage and his wife Danielle both work at Intel. They moved to North Plains in the summer of 2014 because of the small-town feel and the great environment to raise their two children. In looking to be more involved in the community, James joined the Planning Commission and in 2018 was elected to City Council. We recently did a Meet Your Councilor Q&amp;A with James to help you get to know him better.

**Q. Why do you serve on the City Council?**

A. Volunteering and giving back to the community is very important to me. Prior to joining City Council in 2018, I served on the Planning Commission and learned a great deal about the nuts and bolts of the City Code and zoning laws. North Plains is a small town going through a lot of changes and I feel that smart and sustainable plans for that growth is key to having a great place to live. People invest a great deal in their homes. It is not just a major financial investment, it is also an investment in their family and quality of life. Your community is where you make your home. My goal is to invest time and effort to make this community the best environment to live and raise a family.  

**Q. What city accomplishment are you most proud of during your time on City Council?**

A. I’m proud of how the community connects and helps each other. I serve on the advisory board of the West Tuality Habitat for Humanity. I was able to help get Habitat for Humanity’s services expanded into North Plains and help organize “repair blitzes” for homeowners in town who need some help keeping their home in good livable conditions. In 2019, we had over 30 volunteers that helped complete needed repairs. This totaled over 120 total volunteer hours from our community, helping others in our community who need it the most in an actual hands-on way.

This work has been on hold this year due to COVID, but my goal is to see it continue soon as we can. I would also like to add a North Plains day each spring. This is where we as a town can volunteer and do some light clean up and afterward have a BBQ and maybe have some live music at a park. This idea is in progress, but the goal is to bring the community together to help one another and celebrate our small city. 

**Q. What opportunity or challenge in the community are you most passionate about and why?**

A. I am very passionate about balancing new developments, while also taking care of our established neighborhoods. New neighborhoods get new streets, sidewalks, and parks, while the core of the City needs sidewalks and other improvements. I do not want the older parts of the city to get left behind in amenities. Budget is a challenge for updating streets and parks for the established neighborhoods. We are going to have to be creative about how we’re going to make it happen, but it’s important and should not be ignored. The new developments are taking a lot of focus, we need to keep what we have updated as well.

**Q. What would you say to a resident who asks you, "What is the best way to get involved in North Plains?**

A. Easy. Two words: Show up. There are a lot of great opportunities - city boards and committees, the library, other community organizations - just show up, start working, and before you know it you’re involved. The sky's the limit. Opportunity looks a lot like work, if you put the time and effort in your opportunities grow. If anyone reading this wants to get involved in an aspect of the community or city, let me know. I am happy to get to know you and help find those opportunities.

**Q. Can you share a Fun Fact about you?** 

A. I’m a constant learner and like to take on new education and work just to experience what it is like. I also love to go hiking, fishing, and foraging for mushrooms with my two children. Oh, and if you’re on Facebook you might have seen a couple of my posts. I like to joke around and often post fun things for my amusement. Hopefully, others think they are fun too.
