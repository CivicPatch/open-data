# 2024 Election of City Councilors &amp; Mayor

**On November 5th,** City voters elected the following open positions:

- **Mayor:** 1 position - 2 year term
  
  - Position currently held by Rob Ward
- **Councilor:** 2 positions - each for a 4 year term 
  
  - Positions currently held by Bill Meyer and Sally Wantz.

The City of Florence Mayor and Councilors are volunteers who serve as the governing body for the City of Florence. The City Council works as a collective body to pass laws, fees, policies, budget and to supervise the City Manager and Municipal Court Judge positions. In order to be versed enough to make such decisions, serving on the Council requires countless hours of study into the pressing issues of the City of Florence, as well as attendance at regular meetings, work sessions, and other external meetings where the Councilor / Mayor will represent the City and its interests.

The Mayor is the presiding officer of the City Council and thus officiates City Council meetings in order to preserve order. The Mayor also works directly with the City Manager to determine the order of business of City Council meeting agendas, and serves as the figurehead for the City of Florence.
