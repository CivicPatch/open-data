# City Council Position #2 - Council President Daren Dufloth

![Daren Dufloth](https://www.umatilla.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_node_primary/public/imageattachments/citycouncil/page/6943/dufloth4.jpg?itok=epZsZ0Vn)

Councilor Daren Dufloth was born in Walla Walla, Washington and raised in Pendleton, Oregon.  He enjoyed playing sports and the drums.  Allowing his passion to guide him, he toured across the Pacific Northwest with several bands before moving to Nashville, Tennessee to pursue a music career.  In 1989 he joined a recording artist and toured across the USA, Canada, and Japan. 

In 1991, while on tour, he met a young lady named Paulette, who had joined the band.  She was hired to sing, play the piano, and fiddle, and she ultimately stole Daren’s heart.  They continued to live in Nashville and were married in 1993.  In 1994, the couple moved to Las Vegas, Nevada and welcomed their first child, Dakota.  They played music at various casinos, for multiple large events and production shows. 

In 1998, they moved to Umatilla, Oregon.  The young couple began to manage and eventually purchased a business from Daren’s parents.  Daren also wanted to be closer to his oldest son, Jakob from a previous marriage.    In 1999, they welcomed their second son, Brylee. In 2001, Daren began his career with the Oregon Department of Corrections and in 2003 they welcomed their daughter, Preslee. 

Daren and Paulette enjoy being a part of the Umatilla community.  They have volunteered for various charity events, clubs, organizations, and associations to support the community.  Daren has coached little league and assisted the high school varsity baseball team. He served as the president of the high school booster club and was a member for many years.

Daren’s beliefs in helping those around him, guided him to part of the City Council, serving as a city councilman and even the Mayor for 18 months.  He was elected in 2020 to serve as a councilman, once again, and is happy to be back serving his community and helping push Umatilla into the future. 

Daren and Paulette have recently pivoted their business to be an anchor tenant in the community.  They have invested in the community and are excited for the future of Umatilla and the surrounding area.
