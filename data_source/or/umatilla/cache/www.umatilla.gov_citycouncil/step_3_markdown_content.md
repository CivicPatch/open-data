[City Council Mayor - Caden Sipe](https://www.umatilla.gov/citycouncil/page/city-council-mayor-caden-sipe)

Serving as the Mayor of Umatilla is an opportunity for me to try to give back to the community that contributed so much to me. After attending Umatilla schools K-12, I graduated with my high school diploma from Umatilla High School and Blue Mountain Community College with my Associate of Arts Degree concurrently. I hold a Bachelor’s in Business Administration from Eastern Oregon University and a Master’s in Teaching from Grand Canyon University. I teach high school manufacturing/shop and middle school robotics in the Umatilla School District.

[City Council Position #1 - Corinne Funderburk](https://www.umatilla.gov/citycouncil/page/city-council-position-1-corinne-funderburk)

History: I was born and raised in Spokane, Washington. After attending college in Salem, Oregon, and earning a teaching degree, I wanted to get as close as I could to my parents who still lived in Spokane. Well, Umatilla, is as close as you can get! I took a first-grade position at the elementary school, and figured I would just stay a few years and move back to Spokane. Well, that was almost 31 years ago! I have never wanted to leave my school district, nor this town. I have loved raising my 3 sons here!
