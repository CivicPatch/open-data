# Charles Maughan

![Mayor Charles Maughan](https://www.corvallisoregon.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_node_primary/public/imageattachments/directory/6101/charles-maughan-2025.png?itok=2mL-nDjn "Mayor Charles Maughan")

Position: 

Mayor

Email: 

charles.maughan@corvallisoregon.gov

Charles Maughan began serving as Corvallis Mayor in January 2023. Prior to that he served two terms as a Corvallis City Councilor. As Mayor, Charles also serves on the boards of Oregon Cascade West Council of Governments and the Home, Opportunity, Planning and Equity (HOPE) advisory board, a joint City/County advisory board to address homelessness. 

In his career, Charles' focus has been housing. He started out as a community manager for an affordable housing project. He currently works as a Compliance Analyst for Oregon Housing and Community Services, which oversees affordable housing projects throughout Oregon. 

Charles became involved in community organizing with the 2016 presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders. He then went on to co-found Our Revolution - Corvallis Allies (ORCA), a local chapter of the national Our Revolution organization. Charles continues to focus on local issues through activism and politics. He believes that through civic engagement progress can be made towards a thriving equitable community.

**DUTIES OF THE MAYOR**

The Corvallis City Charter says, "every fourth year .., a Mayor shall be elected." The Charter also specifies that the Mayor shall:

1. chair the City Council
2. approve records of Council proceedings
3. approve ordinances (or not)
4. appoint committees, and
5. endorse all bonds of officers of the City.

There are expectations beyond those in the Charter, however. The Mayor of Corvallis is expected to represent the community’s values at gatherings large and small, within and beyond the city, and whenever a citizen feels it is time to call the mayor.

Chairing the City Council includes presiding over its deliberations, with the authority to determine the order of business, preserve order, enforce the rules of the Council, and call special meetings if necessary. The Mayor does not vote except in the case of a tie.

All approved records of the proceedings of the Council (such as minutes or resolutions) must be signed by the Mayor. Ordinances (codes/laws) can be vetoed, although two-thirds of the Council can overturn a veto.

The City Charter also says, "The Mayor shall appoint the committees provided under the rules of the Council." This is a big job. For each two-year term, each City Councilor is appointed by the Mayor to one of three standing committees wherein much of the work of the Council is done in public meetings. Councilors are also appointed as liaisons to a broad range of civic organizations and to the 23 boards, commissions, and committees that advise the Council. Meanwhile it is very important for the Mayor to be continually on the lookout for people of good will and good judgment to serve on those advisory bodies.
