 1.  [ABOUT](https://ashlandoregon.gov/379/City-Council/) 

## Overview

Ashland has a Council-Manager form of government, with much of the City's business evolving through citizen committees that enhance public support and political stability.

The City Council is elected to serve as the governing body for Ashland's 21,360 residents (Portand State University Population Research Center certified population for 2020). The Mayor, who presides at the Council meetings, is elected at-large for a four-year term. Six Council members are elected at-large for four-year staggered terms.

Study Sessions are held the day before each regular meeting (typically the first and third Monday) at 5:30 pm in the Council Chambers.

### Watch a Meeting 

City Council meetings are televised via live. [Learn how to watch a meeting or view video archives.](https://ashlandoregon.gov/740/Watch-a-Meeting) Meetings can also be attended in person at Council Chambers at 1175 E Main St.
