# Elected Officials

The Madras City Council is a Mayor-Council form of government. The Mayor is a two-year term, directly elected office and does not vote except to break tie votes. The six council positions are elected at large on staggered four-year terms. All elected positions are uncompensated volunteers. All Councilors also serve on the Madras Redevelopment Commission and the Budget Committees, but also have the option of serving on a wide variety of other committees that help keep the City connected to the community and other government and service agencies. Council reviews the list of committees each year for relevance, changes, additions/deletions and makes appointments. The list of this year's committees assignments is included at the bottom of this page.
