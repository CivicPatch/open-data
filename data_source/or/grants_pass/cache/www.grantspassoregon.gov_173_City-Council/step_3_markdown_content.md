# City Council

Grants Pass is a council-manager form of government. The Mayor and Councilors volunteer their time to serve our community. Elected by city residents, they serve their respective wards.

Eight Councilors represent four wards and are elected at large to 4-year terms of office. The Council oversees city government and employs a City Manager who is in charge of the city staff and departments.

City Council meetings and workshops are held in the Council Chambers at 5th & NW A streets in Grants Pass.

 *  __Regular Meetings__ - 1st and 3rd Wednesday of each month at 6 p.m.
 *  __Workshops __ - Mondays at 11:45 a.m. Workshops are informal, 75 to 90 minutes, and are generally staff presentations on a specific subject, agenda review, or other matters the Council has requested.
 *  __Agendas, minutes, and videos__ are available in the [Agenda Center](https://www.grantspassoregon.gov/agendacenter).
   *  [Sign up to be notified when they are posted.](https://www.grantspassoregon.gov/list.aspx)
