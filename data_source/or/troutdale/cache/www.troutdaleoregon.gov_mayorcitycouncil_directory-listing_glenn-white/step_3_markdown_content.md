Profile

My family and I have enjoyed living in Troutdale for over 28 years and especially value the friendships we continue to make. Some of my favorite things to do are: outdoor recreational activities, organic gardening, and being a grandpa.

Locally I've worked as a truck driver/mechanic for Sunshine Dairy, Boeing Food Service Director, and Tads' Chicken N Dumplings Line Cook.  My wife works making pottery and volunteers on committees. My children went to Troutdale Elementary, MHCC and local colleges. They love our home and I will do my best with your input to keep Troutdale vibrant, affordable and special.

In caring for our community, it's been an honor to volunteer. I've served on the Troutdale City Council for eight years, Citizens Advisory Committee for six years, River Safety Committee and Open for Business Sub Committee. Some of my priorities are supporting safety, thoughtful growth, strong schools, community health, business friendly policies and maintaining infrastructure.  As your councilor I work for you and continue to advocate for an open city process that includes truthfully informing you (pros and cons), justification of expenses, a thorough budget review, and committee and community involvement.  I always ask myself before decision making, as our past Mayor Paul Thalhofer would, "Is it good for Troutdale?"

For 100 years Troutdale Volunteers have helped make this small town so special.  I encourage all to come to city meetings, work sessions, town halls and volunteer for city committees.  I look forward to representing and working with you to enhance Troutdale's Community.
