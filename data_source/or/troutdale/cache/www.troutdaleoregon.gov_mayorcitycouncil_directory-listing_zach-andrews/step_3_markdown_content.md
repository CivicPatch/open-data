Profile

My wife and I moved to Portland 11 years ago, and relocated to Troutdale in 2020. This city has given my family so much in the several years we've lived here, I want to protect that and help us thrive by giving back. You may catch me enjoying the Sandy River with my family, studying the stars through a telescope by night, or practicing archery at some nearby ranges. I'm driven by a great sense of justice and innovation, and I care deeply about the healthy development and growth of our city. 

I have had the honor of serving on the Troutdale Planning Commission, and chaired the Troutdale Town Center Advisory Board and Parks Advisory Committee. I’ve had a hand in developing our Parks Master Plan for the next 20 years, and was actively involved in the RFQ process for the exciting development of the Confluence site along the Sandy River. My professional background is in the renewable energy and sustainable technology industries, and I’m passionate about leaving our world and this city in a better state by my actions.

Some of my goals are to continue working solutions for keeping costs down and being fiscally responsible, protecting and advancing what makes Troutdale unique while growing, and ensuring the community is best represented and heard in a personally unbiased and informed manner. I intend to make decisions and weigh input with the lens of increasing property value, keeping a focus on effective safety, health and education services for the community, and overseeing responsible upkeep and expansion of our city infrastructure. 

I encourage everyone who cares about the future of this town to get involved in some capacity and be an engaged part of shaping this community for the years to come. Volunteering has been deeply rewarding, and it’s a highly effective way to impact your immediate surroundings and make a difference in what matters to you. 

**Government &amp; Volunteer Experience:** 

- Planning Commission
- Parks Advisory Committee (chair)
- Town Center Advisory Board (chair)
