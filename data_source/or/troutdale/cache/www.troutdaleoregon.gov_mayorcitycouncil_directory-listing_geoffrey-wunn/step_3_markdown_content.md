 The opportunity to serve the community of Troutdale is a huge honor.  I have spent my entire life in this great community, having seen it grow from the small town of my childhood into the blossoming city it is today.  Troutdale is unique on that it offers that small community feel with big city amenities, making it a desirable place to live.  After graduating high school and going to nursing school, I returned to Troutdale to plant my roots and have found that raising my family here could not have been a better choice. 

 This adventure into politics is new for me, as I have been a pediatric nurse for the past 20 years.  I started in the acute care setting and then advanced my career to the pediatric intensive care unit, where I found immense joy in helping families through tough and stressful situations.  I am currently a pediatric critical care flight nurse at OHSU where I get to drive and fly around the region to safely transport pediatric patients back to a pediatric hospital for ongoing care.  

 I really enjoy helping people and I am excited to begin serving the members of this community as I am able.  The visions I have for Troutdale include thriving businesses, increased access to parks for all, and a city where people feel safe and welcomed.
