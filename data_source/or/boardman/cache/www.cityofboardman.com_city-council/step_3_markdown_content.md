### City of Boardman Charter 2024

- [2024 City of Boardman Charter 173.11 KB](https://www.cityofboardman.com/media/10116)

### How to Speak at a Public Hearing

At the City of Boardman, and throughout Oregon, most decisions concerning land use, zoning, budgeting, the enactment or change of the laws, and many other matters are required to go through a “public hearing” so citizens may have a say in the decision. A public hearing is your opportunity to tell the decision makers what you would like done. Here are some suggestions for making the most of your testimony at a public hearing, whether it is before the City Council, Planning Commission, or Budget Committee.  
 

Before the hearing:  
• Be informed: Learn about the hearing, read up or interview people on the subject before you plan your testimony.  
• Know the law: Become familiar with the laws involved in the hearing so your testimony does not ask the officials to violate that law.  
• Be familiar with the public hearing process: For land use decisions please see the City of Boardman Development Code Chapter 4.1.500-4.1.600.  
• Anticipate questions: Try to anticipate questions and how you will answer them.  
 

During the hearing:  
• Arrive early so you don’t miss anything.  
• Be bold: If you have an idea, submit it. If you have a question, ask it.  
• Be reasonable: Remember everyone has different views and opinions. Be open and prepared to compromise. Express feelings you have in a courteous manner.  
• Remember your objective: When speaking about an issue or idea, have a solution or conclusion ready.  
• Speak to the point: Don’t get sidetracked on other issues. Speak about the subject at hand.  
• State your recommendations clearly: Don’t expect others to guess or understand you, explain when needed.  
 

After a hearing for land use matters:  
• If the Planning Commission or City Council grant a continuance, the completion of the hearing shall be continued to a certain date, time, and place.  
• If the Planning Commission or City Council leave the record open for additional written evidence or testimony, the record shall be left open for at least seven days after the hearing. A specific schedule will be slated.  
• A Notice of Decision will be mailed to the applicant and to all participants of record within five business days after the hearing body’s decision.
