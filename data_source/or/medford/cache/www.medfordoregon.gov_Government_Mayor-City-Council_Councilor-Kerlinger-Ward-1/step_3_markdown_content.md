Mike Kerlinger was elected to office in 2024 and began serving as Ward 1 Councilor in January of 2025.

 Mike has lived in Medford most of his life and is a proud graduate of Phoenix High School.  Having grown up in Medford, he has witnessed the city’s evolution from its shifts in housing availability, business opportunities, recreational options, and overall growth.  Mike is deeply committed to addressing the housing shortage by supporting mixed-use and mixed-income developments.  These initiatives would provide residents with greater housing options while creating new opportunities for local businesses.  Additionally, Mike plans to collaborate with developers to overcome obstacles related to traditional single-family housing. 

 He believes that it is essential to balance the Medford’s unique character with strategic planning which fosters growth, opportunity, diversity, and vitality in housing, the economy, and the community’s culture.   *“As Medford continues to grow, we must plan strategically to ensure that it remains a thriving community now and into the future.”* 

 Mike is dedicated to supporting economic growth by partnering with local businesses to strengthen existing operations and attract new investments.  This approach will diversify employment opportunities and create a more stable, resilient local economy.  A strong business sector allows residents to live, work, and shop right in Medford, improving both job stability and quality of life.  Furthermore, Mike wants to create more opportunities for art, dining, recreation, and cultural experiences so residents can enjoy a vibrant, fulfilling community life. 

 Mike’s vision focuses on interconnected priorities such as safety, housing, employment, and quality of life.  By addressing these pressing issues, he believes we can create a brighter, more prosperous future for Medford—one that enhances opportunities for current and future generations.  Mike is committed to making Medford an even better, more inclusive, and thriving community for all. 

 Mike has volunteered for service on the Board of Directors, Government Affairs Committee, and as a PAC Trustee for the Rogue Valley Association of REALTORS®.
