Dr. Ghoddusi is a Family Medicine Physician, currently practicing and teaching medical students and residents at OHSU. He is also currently the Executive Director of Healthy Oregon, a digital health nonprofit that provides health education and access to community resources by working with underrepresented communities to reduce healthcare disparities across Oregon.

Before moving to Tigard, Councilor Ghoddusi was Major in the United States Air Force, establishing health care policy and caring for our Active Duty Service Members at home and abroad. Now that he's separated from the military, the Ghoddusi family has built a foundation here in Tigard to be their forever home. As such, you'll see the whole family at community events, volunteering in service projects, and contributing to help make Tigard a welcoming home for all residents.
