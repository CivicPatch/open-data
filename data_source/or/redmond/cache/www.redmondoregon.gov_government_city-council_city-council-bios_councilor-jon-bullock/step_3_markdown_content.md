I grew up in a very small mid-western town and after graduating high school, joined the Army. After honorably serving as a Paratrooper in the 82^(nd) Airborne, I moved to Oregon to attend COCC.  I met the woman that would become my wife on my first day in town and more than 20 years later we are still together and still holding hands. Lisa and I purchased our first home together and moved to Redmond in 2003. Together we have five children. For the majority of my military and civilian life I have worked in finance and banking, I am the branch manager of a local credit union in Redmond and am very active in the community.

 I know that Redmond is well positioned to move into a brighter future if we work together for the common good. We can find solutions for housing, quality of life and economic opportunity right here at home. I will work to bring all sides to the table to find responsible solutions to the issues we face and deliver positive results for Redmond.
