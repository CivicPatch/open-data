Redmond City Council members pride themselves on being accessible to Redmond residents. At each regular Council meeting, citizens are given the opportunity to express their views to the Council. The Council members have public telephone numbers, and they are always interested in talking to the citizens they represent. Since Council members are elected city-wide, each member represents all Redmond citizens.
