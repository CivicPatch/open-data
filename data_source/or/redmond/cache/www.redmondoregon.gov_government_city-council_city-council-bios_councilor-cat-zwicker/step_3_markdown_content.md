![City Councilor Cat Zwicker](https://www.redmondoregon.gov/home/showpublishedimage/5428/637800830516070000) **Councilor, Cat Zwicker**  
[Cat.Zwicker@redmondoregon.gov](mailto:cat.zwicker@redmondoregon.gov)

As a local small business owner and Redmond resident for the past 21 years I am excited and honored to be representing the community I know and love as your Council member.

I was born in Augsburg, Germany while my folks 3rd generation Oregonians, were stationed overseas on behalf of the US Army.  Like numerous military offspring, I’ve spent time in multiple states and cities following my dad from assignment to assignment.  Travelling across this great country and being exposed to a wide variety of people and cultures is truly inspiring and I continue to take the opportunity to do so when I can.

I have always had a strong desire to help others and my community which has led me down the path I’m on both professionally and in leadership. I graduated from the University of Georgia with a BA in Political Science, specializing in Global (International) Studies, but did not immediately find a use for those skills. Instead, after moving numerous times as a young adult, I became a fulltime real estate broker to help people transitioning in and out of real estate, first in Northern Virginia and then in Oregon.  I moved to Redmond in 2000 and have witnessed the more than doubling of the population in that time as well as the recession and the recovery.

Currently, I own and manage an independent real estate brokerage where we deal with the day-to-day realities of our housing supply and affordability.  My passion for helping people with their housing needs coupled with our rapid growth led me to apply for the Redmond Urban Area Planning Commission in 2019.  The land use and planning process has further inspired me to advocate for the needs of our community and I applied for the vacated Council seat I now hold. I strongly believe that access to amenities such as childcare, senior services, quality education, employment at competitive wages and maintaining infrastructure to support growth are all key elements of a strong and viable community.  

As a public servant, I remain active and engaged in the community through volunteer work on committees that strive to meet the goals for key amenities I noted. Volunteering lets you help create the kind of community you want to live in every day! I look forward to representing you.
