## Shannon Wedding

| ![City Councilor Shannon Wedding](images/4674e6f6125ebe0f5e336e78d2ec34062cfb54ef25e5edf223e7b817737d9990.png) |__Councilor, Shannon Wedding__    [Shannon.Wedding@redmondoregon.gov](mailto:Shannon.Wedding@redmondoregon.gov)   Phone: 541.923.7710|
|---|---|

First and foremost, I can’t express how excited I am to represent the citizens of Redmond as a City Councilor.  

I was born in Houston, Texas, and spent most of my time in different parts of the state while attending grade school and college. My family is originally from the Northeast and I spent a few years as a child living in Connecticut before moving back to Texas with my family. I graduated from Texas Tech University in Lubbock, TX with a BS in Civil Engineering and a MBA focused on entrepreneurship. I hold my professional engineering license in 4 states; Oregon, Washington, Texas and New Mexico.   

I have worked as a Civil Engineer for 16 years with a majority of my career focused on critical infrastructure including potable water, wastewater and water reuse.  I worked as a public servant and Managing Engineer for the City of Houston Drinking Water Operations and Planning and Development Services prior to moving to Oregon where I gained a valuable perspective while working with the public.  Whether I am serving as an employee or an elected official, I thoroughly enjoy being able to directly help citizens and believe every voice deserves to be heard.  It can feel like a thankless job at times, but the successes always heavily outweigh the disappointments. I have direct experience with Emergency Response Planning and Management Plans for large scale natural disasters and understand the criticality of having those in place. I have always felt that cities should have a proactive approach to infrastructure in lieu of only reacting during emergencies or after development exceeds what’s already in place. I feel that protecting public health and safety is critical to a successful community and building that trust with the citizens is important.  

I am also a strong supporter of local business and value the relationships I’ve developed with the friends and families behind owning an operating those establishments we all know and love. Local business is the core of the community and what helps Redmond thrive.
