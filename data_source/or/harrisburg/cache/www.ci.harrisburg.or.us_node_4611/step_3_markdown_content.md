# Council Member Randy Klemm

![Councilor Randy Klemm](https://www.ci.harrisburg.or.us/sites/default/files/styles/full_node_primary/public/imageattachments/citycouncil/page/6911/randy_klemm.jpg?itok=yRRxxVSw "Councilor Randy Klemm")

### Title:  Council Member

### Name:  Randy Klemm

### Current Term:  Jan 1, 2021 to Dec 31, 2024

**Council/Government Experience:**  Even though Randy is the newest City Council member, he has served the City of Harrisburg for many years.  He was first appointed to the Harrisburg Planning Commission on May 18, 2004; becoming Vice-Chair in March 2005 until March 1, 2007.  He was appointed to the City Council, to serve the term vacated by Sarah Puls. (Ending on Dec 31, 2020).  He also served on the board for the HART Community Center, as well as on the Linn County Commission on Children and Families, the Linn County Local Drug and Alcohol Planning Committee, and the Harrisburg School District.  He has recently started his 3rd year of (recent) service to the City Council.

**Current Committee Assignments:**  Harrisburg Budget Committee

Randy is a pharmacist who graduated from Oregon State University in 1985. He, together with his wife of almost 25 years, Debbie, own a long-term-care pharmacy in Eugene. Shortly after they were married in 1994, they moved to Harrisburg, and fell in love with this great little town. They have been here ever since.

Randy has been involved with politics and local social committees for most of his adult life. From helping to form the H.A.R.T. Center here in Harrisburg and the Harrisburg City Planning Committee to serving on the Linn County Commission on Children and Families as well as the Linn County Local Drug and Alcohol Planning Committee. He served on the Harrisburg School District Board of Directors for 12 years before retiring in 2017. But not for long. The Mayor came calling in late 2018 asking if he would be interested in serving on the Harrisburg City Council. After talking and praying about it with his wife, they decided that this was a great opportunity to serve a great community with some really great people.

Randy and Debbie have four children, Brandi (30), Morgan (28), Haley(22) and Brayden (20) and two grandchildren, Averie (5) and Riann (2). In his spare time, Randy enjoys spending time with his family, camping with family and friends and the occasional round of golf.
