 Sean VanGordon serves as the Mayor of Springfield, Oregon, where he has been a driving force behind the city’s growth and transformation for over a decade. A champion for housing, economic development, and transportation policy, Sean’s leadership is rooted in a commitment to creating a community of opportunity where families and businesses thrive.   

 Sean moved to Springfield in 2001 to attend the University of Oregon, earning a Master’s Degree in economics and a Bachelor’s Degree in political science. He and his wife, Elaine, purchased their first home in Springfield in 2007, solidifying their ties to the community. In 2011, he joined the Springfield City Council, representing the Gateway Area (Ward 1) for over a decade.   

 During his tenure, Sean has been instrumental in Springfield’s transformation. He played a critical role in securing funding to improve Springfield’s roads, repave 42 nd Street, and rebuild Mill St. Under his leadership, downtown Springfield has experienced a renaissance, becoming a vibrant hub for arts, culture, and local businesses. The Gateway District has also thrived, welcoming major expansions like the Shoppes at Gateway and new corporate investments, further diversifying Springfield’s economy.   

 As Mayor, Sean continues to build on Springfield’s legacy of “getting things done,” fostering a vibrant economy centered on timber, manufacturing, food, tourism, and healthcare. His vision is to ensure Springfield remains a place where people choose to build their futures and raise their families.   

 Outside of public service, Sean is a devoted husband and father. He lives in Springfield with his wife Elaine, their twin daughters Katie and Livy, and their Labrador, Marcus. A lifelong learner and avid reader of history, economics, and politics, Sean draws inspiration from understanding the past to shape Springfield’s future. Whether cheering on the University of Oregon Ducks or exploring Oregon’s great outdoors with his family, Sean’s passion for connection and discovery is at the core of his leadership and life.
