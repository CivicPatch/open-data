## Ward 5: Councilor Victoria Doyle

Victoria Doyle, representing Ward 5, was born and raised in Springfield and attended Thurston High School but her community service extended to other Oregon communities. She had a 13-year hiatus to Cottage Grove where she served on the Cottage Grove City Council for 4 years and the Cottage Grove Budget Committee while also commuting to Roseburg for the family business. In Roseburg, she served on the board of Saving Grace Pet Adoption Center.

Councilor Doyle has been working at City of Eugene in Public Works Engineering and Public Works Maintenance since 2014. She brings depth of knowledge on a range of service areas including City infrastructure, land use, development, and housing.

After moving back to Springfield in 2015, Councilor Doyle served as a community representative on the Springfield Budget Committee for multiple terms, the Community Development Advisory Committee, and the LRAPA board before being elected to serve on the Springfield City Council.

She has been appointed to serve on the City’s Budget Committee, Finance and Judiciary Committee, Historic Commission, Planning Commission, Main Street Governing Committee; as well as the Springfield Economic Development Agency and the Lane County Human Services Commission.

Councilor Doyle has been married for over 21 years to her best friend, Mark. Their family has included dozens of Boxer rescues and Saint Bernard’s over the years – each becoming part of what they like to call the “Doyle Pack.” Animal rescue is a passion and Doyle will never be without dogs in her life and home. When she’s not hiking Mt. Pisgah or the Thurston Trail, she is shooting Sporting Clay events and long-range rifle competitions, hunting, and traveling the world. She also lives for football season (Go Ducks and Pittsburgh Steelers) but there really isn’t a sport she won’t watch.

“Even though I have lived throughout Lane County over the years, Springfield is my home, and I knew I would always find my way back here for good,” Councilor Doyle said. “I look forward to serving the community I love and am always available to share a cup of coffee and hear ideas and opinions from anyone who may wish to meet with me.”
