The council consists of a mayor and six councilors nominated and elected from the city at-large. The mayor presides over and facilitates council meetings, preserves order, enforces council rules, and determines the order of business under council rules. The mayor is a voting member of the council and has no veto authority. With the consent of the council, the mayor appoints members of commissions and committees established by ordinance or resolution. The mayor must sign all records of council decisions. The mayor serves as the political head of the city government. At its first meeting each year, the council must elect a president from its membership. The president presides in the absence of the mayor and acts as mayor when the mayor is unable to perform duties. The council, by resolution, must adopt rules consistent with state law, to govern its meetings.

The council must meet at least once a month at a time and place designated by its rules and may meet at other times in accordance with the rules. A majority of the council is a quorum to conduct business, but a smaller number may meet and compel the attendance of absent members, as prescribed by council rules. 

Council meetings are held on the second Monday of every month. Council meetings are held in the McCluskey Chambers of City Hall located at 13 South 1st Street, Creswell, Oregon.  Council meetings are open to the public, and begin promptly at 6:00 p.m., unless otherwise posted. 

Agendas are available the Friday before the council meeting at City Hall. If you have an item you wish to have placed on the agenda, you must contact the City Manager or City Recorder at (541) 895-2531. You must have all materials to the City Recorder by no later than six business days prior to the meeting. This allows the recorder time to finalize the agenda and copy materials for the council.

# Meet the City Council

# Mayor Nick Smith

I'm Nick Smith and I'm excited to be your Mayor! I was born (near) and raised in Creswell. I graduated as a Creswell Bulldog in 1996. After graduation, I moved to Eugene for a few years to go to college, play sports, and work. I met my wife, Libby, and we married in 2007. Libby and I bought our first home in Creswell that same year. We now have 3 incredible young children; which means we are deeply invested in Creswell's future. I currently manage Roberts Supply Co., Inc. in Springfield, Oregon and my mindset is very business-oriented. In my free time, I enjoy coaching Creswell Babe Ruth Baseball and Willamette Valley Youth Football. My greatest passion is mentoring youth through coaching sports. I also love camping, fishing, hunting and family time. I ran for city council in 2022, was elected, and have been serving the community ever since. I saw a need for a conservative voice on the council and decided to get involved. I wanted to do something, not just say something. I wanted to see change, so I decided to be the change. This is my hometown and my kid's hometown and my family takes great pride in it! Creswell has a lot to offer and I'm honored to be part of the leadership in our great little community!

Mayor Smith's term concludes in December 2026.

# Council President Alonzo Costilla

Hello, fellow Creswellians, my name is Alonzo Costilla, and I am honored to be serving as your city councilor.  My family and I fell in love with the small town feeling of Creswell 14 years ago and immediately called it home.  I have worked in the printing industry for 30 years.  My hobbies include fishing and hiking, and I enjoy serving at my church in Creswell and for the city’s Fourth of July parade and Disaster Preparedness Fair.  I also served as Director of Say NO to Onegro PAC in opposition of Measure 20-280.  I have enjoyed volunteering for short-term projects in Creswell.  As councilor, my first elected position, I embrace the task as a long-term position and an avenue for collaborative service to my hometown as we grow together.

Council President Costilla's term concludes in December of 2026.

# Councilor Staci Holt

As a lifetime resident of Lane County, I have been connected to the community of Creswell for most of my life through family and friends. I have been a resident of Creswell for nearly 2 years now, and am so happy to call this friendly city my home. I have spent the last 25 years working in the information technology space, with a strong focus on data and analysis. In my spare time I enjoy volunteering, singing, crafting, watching college football, exploring astronomy and spending time with family and friends. I am honored to have an opportunity to serve our community, and look forward to being actively engaged in the work that is needed to “keep the lights on” in Creswell. 

Councilor Holt's term concludes in December 2026.

# Councilor Clark Kent

Hello! My name is Clark Kent, and I have had the privilege of serving as a City Councilor for the past year, following my appointment to the vacant position.

I was born in Chicago, moved to Eugene in 1997, and found my home in Creswell in 2017. I immediately fell in love with The Friendly City, and I’ve been proud to call it home ever since. I’ve been working in public libraries for 33 years, and I’m currently celebrating my 26th year at the Eugene Public Library.

My wonderful wife Joanie and I recently celebrated our 11th anniversary. We are passionate about music—whether listening to it, performing it, or reading and learning more about it. We also enjoy playing tabletop games together.

Over the past year, I have been honored to serve on the Public Safety Committee, the Water Rate Advisory Committee, and the Budget Committee. These roles have deepened my commitment to serving the citizens of Creswell and working toward our community's continued growth and well-being.

I am truly grateful to represent the people of Creswell, and I look forward to continuing to serve with dedication and integrity.

Councilor Kent's term concludes in December of 2028.

# Councilor Joan Morris

My name is Joan Morris, and I’ve been a resident of Creswell for eleven years. After retiring as a Registered Nurse, I’m excited to participate in local government for the first time. During my career, I worked for the State of Oregon as a long-term care inspector, licensing and regulating nursing homes, assisted living, and memory care facilities to ensure quality care for elders and those with disabilities. I look forward to collaborating with my fellow council members to make positive changes for the residents of Creswell!

Councilor Morris' term concludes in December 2028.
