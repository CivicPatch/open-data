# City Council

Happy Valley’s safe, livable community is the outcome of decades of thoughtful planning and steadfast leadership.

## We work hard to create a livable and vibrant community.

The City of Happy Valley is governed by the Happy Valley City Council, which is comprised of three City councilors, one Council president, and the mayor. All councilors and the mayor serve four-year terms and are elected by the voters of the City of Happy Valley in the general election in November.

The Happy Valley City Council serves the City on a voluntary basis and dedicates a considerable amount of time in their involvement not only at Council meetings but also as representatives of the City in regional and statewide capacities.

 [Mayor’s Message](https://www.happyvalleyor.gov/city-hall/city-council/a-message-from-the-mayor/)  [Council Corner](https://www.happyvalleyor.gov/council-corner/) 

## Mayor & City Council

The council consists of a mayor and four councilors nominated and elected by the city at large. Terms are staggered so that term expiration occurs every two years. This ensures that the City has at least two experienced Council members at all times.

Happy Valley is more than a place to live—it’s a community I deeply love and am honored to serve. As a City Councilor, I am proud to represent a city that values safety, livability, and thoughtful growth. From our expansive parks and trails to our innovative approaches to transportation and infrastructure, we strive to create a vibrant, inclusive environment where families, businesses, and neighbors can thrive. With a strong background in healthcare innovation and community leadership, I have dedicated my career to building programs that uplift children, families, and neighborhoods, including my work with Parrott Creek and the North Clackamas School District.I was inspired to bring my experience to City Council to ensure that as Happy Valley grows, we preserve what makes it unique. Supporting local businesses is crucial, as they are the heart and soul of our community. City-sponsored events and partnerships further strengthen the bonds between neighbors and organizations, fostering a connected, thriving city. My vision for Happy Valley is bold: a city where progress meets preservation, where we set the standard for what a forward-thinking, inclusive community can achieve. Together, we can ensure Happy Valley remains a beacon of opportunity and pride for generations to come.As we move forward, I remain committed to engaging with residents, listening to their voices, and creating solutions that reflect our shared values. With a community-first approach and a focus on collaboration, I believe we can build on Happy Valley’s many strengths to achieve a future that continues to inspire and connect us all.
