Each councilor represents a city ward, which is a district of the city used for political purposes. If you do not know which ward you live in, use the interactive  [ward map](https://www.cityofsalem.net/government/city-council-mayor/about-city-council/find-a-ward-map)  to find out. You may want to contact your representative on City Council if you have:

 * Questions about topics discussed at a recent City Council meeting
