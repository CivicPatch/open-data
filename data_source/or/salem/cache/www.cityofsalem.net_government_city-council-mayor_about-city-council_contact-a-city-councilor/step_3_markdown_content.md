# Contact a City Councilor

The Mayor and City Council are elected by residents to develop and decide on policies that affect the City government and the city. All Council members are unpaid volunteers who give their time to serve their community.

Each councilor represents a city ward, which is a district of the city used for political purposes. If you do not know which ward you live in, use the interactive [ward map](https://www.cityofsalem.net/government/city-council-mayor/about-city-council/find-a-ward-map) to find out. You may want to contact your representative on City Council if you have:

- Questions about topics discussed at a recent City Council meeting
- Topics of importance to the City that you would like to bring to the attention of your City Councilor
