# City Council &amp; Mayor

The Salem City Council is made up of eight City Councilors, each elected to represent one of Salem’s wards, and the Mayor, who is elected by voters throughout the City. They are volunteers who study city issues, solve problems, and take advantage of the opportunities facing local government.

## Meet Your Mayor &amp; City Council

CC:Media, in partnership with the City of Salem, created these videos so that you could hear Salem's Mayor and City Councilors describe in their own words their hopes for our community and their reasons for serving.
