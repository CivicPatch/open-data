## Mayor Julie Hoy

 ![B-mayor julie cropped](images/d7cc34cd3ac032bf084c9f6d2d8a9fe84ccb8be494cc8561d970da41eeb7a68a.jpg) Julie Hoy was elected as the Mayor of Salem in May 2024, bringing with her a wealth of experience in public service and community engagement. Prior to her mayoral election, she served as a City Councilor after being elected in May 2022, where she focused on initiatives that promote community development, sustainability, and inclusivity.

Born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, Julie has lived in the same northeast Salem neighborhood for over thirty years. Her long-standing commitment to her community is reflected in her active involvement in local affairs and her dedication to improving the quality of life for all residents.

A multifaceted artist, Julie has spent much of her life as a musician, composer, and performer. Her artistic endeavors not only showcase her creativity but also highlight her belief in the power of the arts to unite and inspire communities. Julie has leveraged her talents to engage with local schools, volunteering for more than 25 years to enrich the educational experiences of students and foster a love for the arts among youth.

In addition to her artistic contributions, Julie has been a dedicated advocate for social justice and poverty alleviation. Since 2001, she has worked with various non-profit organizations, focusing on initiatives aimed at breaking the cycle of poverty in underserved regions, particularly in Oaxaca and Chiapas. Her commitment to these causes underscores her belief in equitable opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their background.

In 2017, Julie and her husband, Roger, took on the challenge of entrepreneurship by purchasing a small family restaurant in Salem. This venture has provided her with firsthand experience in navigating the complexities of small business ownership, including compliance with government regulations and the importance of maintaining a positive work environment. Through this experience, she has gained valuable insights into the needs and challenges faced by local businesses, which she aims to address as Mayor.

As Mayor, Julie is dedicated to fostering a collaborative and inclusive community where every resident feels empowered to participate in local governance. She believes that the strength of Salem lies in the active involvement of its residents and is committed to creating opportunities for dialogue and engagement among all stakeholders.

With a vision for a vibrant, equitable, and safe city, Julie is poised to lead Salem into a promising future, ensuring that it remains a place where everyone can thrive.
