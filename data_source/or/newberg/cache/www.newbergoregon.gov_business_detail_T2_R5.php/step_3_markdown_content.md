 Peggy Kilburg - Councilor District 2 Peggy has lived in or near Newberg for most of her adult life, beginning as a student at George Fox University where she completed her bachelor’s degree in Business and Economics in 1976.

In her career in Human Resources, 12 years at Hewlett-Packard and 21 years as HR director at George Fox, she developed skills that will serve her well as a city councilor, including leadership, decision making, and communication skills. She believes in hard work and the use of common sense. She intends to study, ask questions, listen, and look at all sides of issues before making decisions.

Peggy and her husband Gary Kilburg, a retired George Fox professor, have a blended family that includes six adult children, four spouses, and the blessing of 14 grandchildren ranging in age from 27 to 5 (including a set of twins and a set of triplets). 

Now that Peggy is retired, she is pleased for the opportunity to serve the City that has done so much for her and her family throughout the years; in fact, she considers it a calling.
