Mayor Bill Rosacker

Mayor Bill Rosacker was elected in November of 2022 to serve the 2023-2026 term.

Mayor Rosacker has lived most of his life in Newberg and cares passionately about our community.

Mayor Rosacker is a private contractor with a history of Project Management, Construction, Real Estate, he owned and operated a trucking company and was a US Army Reconnaissance Sergeant. In the past he served on the Newberg Budget Committee and was the chairman of the Downtown Redevelopment Committee. Mayor Rosacker has been actively involved in city issues for many years, volunteering or leading when needed. 

His focus during his term is to bring leadership and accountability to City Hall, demanding utility billing funds are responsibly spent, restoring fiscal responsibility, reducing and restructuring fees and system development charges, prioritizing growth and reducing housing costs. He wants to prohibit houseless camping in Newberg, instead making sure that those who are responsible for housing the homeless take care of the few who live in our community while not attracting others.

In 2025 he is advocating for improvement in the aesthetics in the downtown commercial core including a better Christmas display for 2025 and supporting the Downtown Coalition to re-implement the Main Street program. The year is off to a great start with the birth of his first grandchild, and the second one due this summer.
