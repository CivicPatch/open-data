#  City Council 

  ![2025 City Council](images/f86f66f10bd3ec982119592b6eaeb13967abf339b0af4d32eb352275da89157d.jpg)  

The City of Dallas is governed by a Council-Manager form of government. This means the city's nine-member City Council establishes ordinances and policies, and directs the City Manager to carry out the city's day-to-day operations. The City Council holds business meetings the first and third Mondays of the month. In addition, the City Council holds workshops, committee meetings and other special assignments as directed by the Mayor and city ordinances. The City Council operates under its adopted [Rules of Procedure](https://www.dallasor.gov/node/4378).

The City Council also serves as the [Agency Board](https://www.dallasor.gov/node/3206) of the city's Downtown Urban Renewal District. More information about urban renewal can be found by  [clicking here](https://www.dallasor.gov/node/3210).
