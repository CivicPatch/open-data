# Councilor Ward 1 - Christine Hyink

![Christine Hyink City Councilor Ward 1](https://www.cottagegroveor.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_node_primary/public/imageattachments/citycouncil/page/14007/christine_hyink.jpg?itok=gvnOBRH4 "Christine Hyink City Councilor Ward 1")

Christine Hyink was elected to the City Council in the November 5, 2024 General Election as the Ward 1 City Councilor, to fill a vacancy until the remainder of the term. 

Christine has called Oregon home for over a decade and moved to Cottage Grove in 2022 with her partner, Nate, and their two dogs. She was drawn to the town’s charm, strong sense of community, and natural beauty, seeing Cottage Grove as the perfect place to settle and get involved. She values the town’s history, small businesses, and welcoming atmosphere and is committed to preserving what makes it special while supporting thoughtful growth.

Before moving to Lane County, Christine lived in North Bend, where she served as Vice President of the Bay Area Chamber of Commerce while working as a Project Manager for the Coquille Tribe. In this role, she collaborated with teams to identify opportunities that benefited both the Tribe and the greater community while managing complex projects.

Christine currently serves as the Central Region Manager for the Oregon Department of Transportation, overseeing DMV operations across multiple locations. Her experience managing diverse teams, improving public services, and working with local and state stakeholders gives her a strong foundation for city governance.

She is passionate about preserving the character of Cottage Grove while supporting economic growth, revitalizing Main Street, and ensuring public safety. She believes in transparent decision-making, practical solutions, and the importance of collaboration and teamwork to achieve the best outcomes for the community.

Councilor Hyink's term expires December 31, 2026.
