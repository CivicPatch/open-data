# City Council

![City Council in New City Hall](https://www.jacksonvilleor.us/ImageRepository/Document?documentId=1150)

***NEW CITY HALL*: Completed in 1883, the County Courthouse was the home of the Jackson County offices on the first floor and the County courtroom on the 2nd floor. The historic structure was purchased from the County in 2014 by the City of Jacksonville and was retrofitted and restored. Now called the Assembly Room of New City Hall, the 2nd floor is the location for City Council and other Committee and Commission meetings.** 

The City Council of Jacksonville is a legislative body composed of a mayor and six councilors elected on a nonpartisan ballot for four-year terms. The Council is responsible for setting policies that are then carried out by the City's various departments. It has the authority to pass municipal ordinances and budgets, make appropriations, set community goals and decide which services the City will provide. 

Regular City Council meetings are held on the first Tuesday of each month at 6 p.m. and Council Work Sessions are regularly held on the third Tuesday of each month at 12;00 p.m. in the New City Hall 2nd Floor Assembly Room.  

## Agendas &amp; Minutes

Agendas are available a minimum of 72 hours prior to the meetings. Minutes are available following approval of the council at the next regular meeting.

We have had some citizens state that they are not able to access the audio files. The City's IT technician has checked the files and they are all functioning. However, he did state that browsers that are out of date may have trouble accessing the audio files. If you are having difficulties, try updating your internet browser.

## Municipal Codes

[Chapters 1 to 14](https://library.municode.com/or/jacksonville/codes/code_of_ordinances) of the Municipal code were revised and codified in 2014.

## Public Meetings Law

Written grievances regarding violations of provisions of Public Meetings Law (ORS 192.610 to 192.705) may be submitted to City Recorder Angela Watson in person, Monday through Thursday, between 8:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. and Friday, between 8:30 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., or via first class mail at PO Box 7, Jacksonville, OR 97530 or electronically at [recorder@jacksonvilleor.us](mailto:recorder@jacksonvilleor.us).
