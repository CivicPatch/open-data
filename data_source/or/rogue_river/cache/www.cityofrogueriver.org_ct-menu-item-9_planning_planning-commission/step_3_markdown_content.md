# Planning Commission

The Planning Commission has special authority under Oregon law to address land use matters, render judgment and/or set forth recommendations on certain matters to the City Council. Commission members are appointed by the Mayor, with the approval of the City Council. Members serve staggered four-year terms.

#### Planning Commission Duties and Responsibilities

As outlined in Title 2 of the Rogue River Municipal Code (RRMC), the powers and duties of the Planning Commission are assigned to it by City Charter, ordinance, resolution and the general laws of the State of Oregon. The powers and duties of the Planning Commission include the following:

- To review, hear at public hearing, and recommend to the City Council the following matters:
  
  - Amendments to the text of the comprehensive plan;
  - Amendments to the general land use map of the comprehensive plan;

  - Amendments to the text of RRMC Title 17 (Zoning);
  - Amendments to the future and/or existing zoning maps;
  - Subdivision, planned unit development and conversion plan applications;
  - Final plats on all subdivisions;
  - Annexations.

The Planning Commission may recommend to the City Council any planning concepts or proposed measures which conform with the comprehensive plan and are designed to enhance the future growth, development and beautification of the municipality. Chief among the Planning Commission's aims is securing for the City and its inhabitants proper sanitation, service from public utilities (sewer, water, streets), and such regulations that promote the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City.
