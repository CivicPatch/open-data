State of the City Message 2025

2024 was a year of positive change for the city. Our accomplishments were many and our setbacks were few.

For the first time in many years we have a fully staffed Police Department. And as sad as it was to say goodbye to Chief of Police Jim Williams, with his assistance, we were able to find and hire the perfect replacement, welcoming Chief Dave Rash to our team in March. Our administration office is also fully staffed now and the Public Works Department can boast the addition of a few more to their ranks as well.

Some of our most notable accomplishments were as follows:

New bill paying options, including credit card, over the phone, on-line, automatic, and on-line building permits.

The completion of Rooster Park with the final piece being a mural wall dedicated to Wanda Nesbit, the founder of the Rogue River Mural Society.

The first National Night Out event. This was a huge success and we hope to continue it yearly.

The successful negotiation to include yard debris recycling for just those who want it with our renewed Southern Oregon Sanitation Franchise Agreement.

The adoption of updated policies, procedures and a number of code amendments to ensure that we are up to date with current law.

The approval of various new businesses and uses in our commercial district. This includes a new garden shop, a grower’s market, a food truck site and a new day care/school based health center to name just a few.

We also saw the approval of three small subdivisions that will hopefully provide some much needed housing.

We would have liked to have started building the new water reservoir this year however it was discovered by our new City Engineer that there were some design and engineering flaws in the existing plan that needed to be corrected. That work is underway and we will finally be able to go out for bid sometime this summer.

Besides our new City Engineer, we also have a new City Attorney and new Auditor. Not only did this result in a savings to the city but it also gave us a fresh viewpoint and prospective on the legal and financial challenges that we continue to face.

I feel blessed, fortunate and proud to live in Rogue River. In the 25 years that I’ve been here, the city has managed to keep its values and charm yet grow and improve. This wouldn’t be possible without the dedicated service of the City Council, Planning Commission and all of our Committee members, the hard work of our employees and the countless hours that our wonderful volunteers have selflessly given to preserve, beautify and maintain this city of ours. And I’m confident that we will meet any challenges that come our way in 2025 with grace, tenacity and renewed purpose.

                                                                                Respectfully Submitted this 2nd day of January 2025,

                                                                                        Mayor Pam VanArsdale

ANNOUNCING THE EASIEST WAY  
TO PAY YOUR BILL  
If you have an Internet connection and an email address, you can now pay your bill online. You are  
also able to “opt in” to paperless billing and receive an email notification when your bill is

stamp when it’s time to send in your payment.

HOW IT WORKS  
We have partnered with Xpress Bill Pay, the premier provider for online bill payment.

When you sign up for online bill payment you’ll create a secure password that you use to access  
your personal account at www.xpressbillpay.com. Every month we’ll send you a reminder email to let  
you know when your bill is online.

Then, just log in through your Web browser or the Xpress Bill Pay Mobile App and view your bill.  
Select a payment type — credit card, debit card, or electronic funds transfer — enter the  
information, and you’re done! It’s that easy, and it only takes you a few minutes each month.

We’re offering this service at the request of customers like you. Sign up today to see why so many  
people consider this method as the best way to pay their bills.
