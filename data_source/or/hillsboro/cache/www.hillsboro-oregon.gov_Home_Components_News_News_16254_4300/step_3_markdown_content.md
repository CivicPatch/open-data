#### Why do you serve on the Hillsboro City Council?

“I believe it is my responsibility to give back to this wonderful city as best as I can. I lived in two other countries before I moved to the US and neither was a democracy. One was a monarchy and the other a brutal military dictatorship. The freedoms, the safety, and the opportunities that are available here are precious and fragile and they depend on ordinary folk taking part in the democratic process.”

#### What are your hopes and goals for serving on the Council?

“Hillsboro is facing complex challenges. The City has taken good steps in solving these issues. I want to work on:

 * Creating affordable housing options that enhance livability
 * Helping foster economic opportunities that promote equality and inclusivity
 * Implementing creative and sustainable climate change solutions

I am a problem solver. As an engineer and an engineering manager, I have learned that the best solutions come from collaboration and listening to every voice. I am committed to working with the community, listening to every voice, and finding solutions that benefit everyone and ensure Hillsboro's future readiness.”

#### What should Hillsboro residents know about how you serve the community as a Council member?

“I take this responsibility seriously. I will work hard. I will keep my values, integrity, transparency, and inclusion, front and center.”

### Fun Facts about Saba

 *  __Name origin:__  My parents named me Sabah, which is an Arabic name. It means morning. They gave me an Arabic name as they were living in Oman at that time. As I was growing up, I fell in love with the poetry of Faiz Ahmed Faiz, a famous poet from Pakistan. He often uses the word 'saba' in his poetry. Saba is a Persian word and it means morning breeze or a gentle breeze. At the age of 15, I dropped the 'h' in my name and changed it to Saba.
 *  __Favorite food:__  Soup
 *  __Favorite beverage:__ Coffee
 *  __Favorite type of books:__ Sci-fi and history. In my youth, I read a lot of horror and mystery. I also enjoy biographies of folks I admire.
 *  __Favorite activities & hobbies:__ Yoga, hiking, and reading
 *  __Favorite music & musicians:__ I love songs one can sing along to. Nayyara Noor is my all-time favorite singer, especially when she sang Faiz Ahmed Faiz's poetry. Also, Zakir Hussain (tabla) and Ravi Shankar (sitar).
 *  __Favorite TV show:__ When I am sick, I binge watch *Murder She Wrote*. I love a good whodunnit. *Frasier* and *Psych* are two shows whose sense of humor tickles me just the right way.
 *  __Favorite movie:__ My all-time favorite movie for many, many years was *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*. An Indian movie that I can still watch any day is *Sholay* , a ‘Western’ Indian movie.
 *  __Favorite vacation spots:__ Heron Island and Rockaway Beach
 *  __Favorite quote:__ This quote gives me a lot of strength: *”Do not be daunted by the enormity of the world's grief. Do justly now, love mercy now, walk humbly now. You are not obligated to complete the work, but neither are you free to abandon it.” — * 
 *  __Favorite ways to spend a weekend:__ Skiing, pottering about in my yard, going on a long hike, and kayaking on Hagg Lake.
 *  __Favorite community spaces in Hillsboro:__ Orenco Station Farmers' Market, Tuesday Night Market, Jackson Bottom Wetlands Preserve, and Hagg Lake.
