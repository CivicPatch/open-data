**Favorite way to spend a weekend:** I love a slow-paced weekend with my family! Waking up to a clean house and lingering cup of coffee, followed by a visit to the Saturday Market is a good start to the morning. The market inspires slow cooking, a big family dinner, and lots of noisy conversation… this makes me happy.

**Favorite community spaces in Hillsboro:** Hillsboro’s Historic Downtown is one of my most cherished areas of our city. I love the unique experience of community gathering on a shutdown Main Street during Tuesday Night Market, Saturday Market, or the Hillsboro Holly Days Celebration. Seasonal events allow residents to explore small businesses, discover market vendors, and randomly run into friends.

Turner Creek Park is another favorite area of Hillsboro located in Ward 2. The park backs to a walking trail along Turner Creek. During good weather months, residents have been known to feed the ducks, walk the trail, play tennis, baseball, or catch a siesta on the grass to enjoy the sun.
