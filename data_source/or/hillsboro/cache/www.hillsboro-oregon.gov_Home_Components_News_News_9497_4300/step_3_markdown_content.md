#### Why serve on the Hillsboro City Council?

"Hillsboro is my home. It’s the city where my wife and I chose to raise our children. It’s the community we sought out for its diversity, inclusion, and safety.  It’s the network of individuals we are lucky enough to call colleagues, neighbors, and friends. This city has given my family an incredible gift. It has been a sanctuary, protecting all we have worked so hard for and all that we hope for the future.

I’m serving on City Council because I believe it’s important to give back to this wonderful city. I serve to ensure that everyone who contributes to our city is served by it — from those who have benefited from generations of prosperity here, to those who are just starting out, finding their voices, or fighting for a fair chance. It is an honor to serve the community and to serve with my colleagues on the City Council."

#### What are your hopes and goals for serving on the Council?

"I have many issues I want to work on but, foremost, I am very concerned about the housing situation here in Hillsboro. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Council to see if we can augment other initiatives to bring more housing — including more affordable housing — to Hillsboro."

#### What should Hillsboro residents know about how you serve the community as a Council member?

"I believe that having many voices heard before a decision is made, typically, makes for a better outcome. To me, presence and availability are important in this role. I intend to continue to attend events, meet residents, and listen and learn."
