****Community Experience****  
Councilor Alcaire has lived in Hillsboro since 2001 and has more than 20 years of community service experience that includes working with culturally-specific youth and families in the Portland metro area, and 18 years working in higher education — advising, teaching, and coaching.

 

She serves on two nonprofit boards: Bienestar of Oregon (since 2011) and Willamette West Habitat for Humanity (since 2018). She has also served as an AmeriCorps Vista Volunteer assisting first-time Spanish speaking mothers in Washington County, and with Columbia Basin tribal members with education and career pathway development. She is the Executive Director for CREATE, a nonprofit located in Cornelius supporting Forest Grove and Cornelius youth and families with high school diploma completion. ****Education &amp; Work Experience****

Councilor Alcaire teaches at Portland Community College. She received her bachelor’s degree and her master’s degree in Mexican History from Portland State University and earned a second master’s degree from Oregon State University. She currently is working to complete her Doctorate of Education, in Education Leadership, from Portland State University.

****Why serve on the Hillsboro City Council?****  
“I care about Hillsboro – the people and the place – and I want to be involved in the continued growth of Hillsboro. I am inspired by the commitments of my fellow Council members, as well as the diversity of Hillsboro community members who make living in Hillsboro such a pleasure!”  
****What are your hopes and goals?****  
“I hope to have a positive impact and make informed decisions throughout my participation on the Council. Hillsboro has a bright future: supporting the development of diverse community resources, revitalizing Hillsboro businesses, developing green spaces for community members to enjoy, and addressing the need for affordable housing.”

****What should Hillsboro residents know about how you serve the community?****

“My mother and father were children of the Great Depression. My parents ensure my family understood how to value each other and appreciate what we have. Every experience I have had in working with underrepresented, underserved communities has taught me valuable lessons about equity and respect for differences and how to help those in need. I invite conversation with the Hillsboro community I am serving because I want to get to know who they are, what they care about, and what they want for Hillsboro. It’s a privilege to serve Hillsboro.”
