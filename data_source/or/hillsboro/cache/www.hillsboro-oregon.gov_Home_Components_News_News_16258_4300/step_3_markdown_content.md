#### Why do you serve on the Hillsboro City Council?

**“**I have always felt it was a blessing to be able to serve my community. I am well aware of the challenges and opportunities Hillsboro is facing over the next few years, so when a Council seat opened up I thought my many years of experience, deep knowledge of this community, and my skill set could be useful to the Council in navigating some challenging issues.”

#### What are your hopes and goals for serving on the Council?

“Both my hope and my goal is that when I have completed my service on Council, every person in Hillsboro is more prosperous, happier, and more content, and every family has found a community where they are welcome and belong.” 

#### What should Hillsboro residents know about how you serve the community as a Council member?

“I will be as transparent as possible in my decision-making and be willing to explain my votes. You may or may not agree with some of my votes, but you will understand why I voted as I did. Hillsboro has grown from 35,000 to 110,000 people since I moved here. That’s a large city. So, I intend to take the time to engage every corner of Hillsboro to help me understand the struggles, concerns, and issues that people all over Hillsboro face.”
