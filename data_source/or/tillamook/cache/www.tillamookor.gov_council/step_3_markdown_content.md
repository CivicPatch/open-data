Under the Tillamook City Charter, the city government is led by an elected Mayor and six City Councilors. The Councilors are elected by wards for four-year terms. The Mayor is elected at large for a four-year term. The Mayor's duties include presiding over City Council meetings, preserving order, enforcing council rules and determining the order of business. The Mayor has a vote only in the case of a tie. At the first meeting of each year, the Council also elects from among its ranks a Council President who presides in the absence of the Mayor. The City Council meets on the first and third Monday of each month at City Hall. In the event of a holiday, the meeting shall take place the day following or on a day agreed upon by the Council at the meeting prior to the holiday. A special meeting of the Council may be properly called by giving 24 hours' advance notice. (ORD 1256A, passed August 1, 2011)
