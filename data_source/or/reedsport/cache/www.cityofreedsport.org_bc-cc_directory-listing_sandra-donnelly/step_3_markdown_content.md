Profile

City Councilor Sandra Donnelly was elected in November of 2024 and began serving in January 2025.

Councilor Donnelly is a native of the Reedsport area. She graduated from Reedsport High School. Teaching was an interest for her, her first teaching position was in South Australia.  From there she worked in Coos Bay, La Grande, and La Quinta, California.  Councilor Donnelly retired in 2012, but worked a few more years as the counselor at Reedsport Community Charter School.

At a young age, Councilor Donnelly was introduced to community service by Tom Tymchuk (past Mayor of Reedsport).  She has been a member of the Lions Club for over 30 years, first in Island City, Oregon and now in Reedsport.  She was a member of the Island City City Council for 8 years.  She has also been a member of the La Grande Rural Fire District Board, and a volunteer at the Barbara Sinatra Center for Children and Eisenhower Hospital in the Palm Springs area.

After she moved to Reedsport in 2012, she served on the Reedsport School Board for several years until she returned to work at the high school. She has been an ASPIRE mentor for 10 years, a board member of the Reedsport Educational Enrichment Foundation, as well as the Gardiner Woman's Literary Club.  She was one of 3 petitioners to get the Lower Umpqua Library bond measure on the ballot.

In her free time she enjoys hiking trails in the area with 3 of her committed hikers. She is a passionate supporter of the Oregon Duck - especially football!
