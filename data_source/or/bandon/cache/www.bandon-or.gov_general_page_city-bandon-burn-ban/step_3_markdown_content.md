Proclamation

BMC 8.20 - Open Burning    Effective: September 10, 2020 - until further notice

 

WHEREAS, the City of Bandon is experiencing extremely dry conditions and is included in an area of Southwestern Oregon that is in a current state of Extreme Fire Danger; and

WHEREAS, the Coos Forest Protective Association, Southwest Oregon District of the Oregon Department of Forestry and Oregon State Parks have noted that there is extreme fire danger and taken steps to restrict open burning, use of power tools, mowing, off-road motor vehicle operations, and other activities that pose increased risk for fire; and

WHEREAS, available resources may be limited given other fires around the state; and

 

WHEREAS, existing conditions make fires a continuing threat to the health, safety, and well-being of the citizens of the City of Bandon and the Greater Bandon Community; now

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that I, Mary Schamehorn, Mayor of Bandon, after consultation with the City Manager and Chief of the Bandon Rural Fire Protection District, do enact the following restrictions:

In respect to Chapter 8.20 of the Bandon Municipal Code; the City shall not authorize, nor shall any person conduct any outside open burning including kindling, maintaining or burning any bonfire, outdoor rubbish or waste fire, or use any trash burners, incinerators or burn barrels, nor allow any such fires or use of such devices on private land.

All exemptions provided for in Chapter 8.20 of the Bandon Municipal Code are hereby suspended.

All open flame fires, including barbecue appliances, charcoal, cooking fires and warming fires, outdoor patio and yard fireplaces, fire pits and smokers, decorative and ornamental fires, ceremonial and recreational fires, and any other open flame fires are not allowed.

The use of all forms of fireworks is prohibited.

Use of the following equipment &amp; activities shall be restricted: use of lawn mowers and tractors, chain saws and other power saws, and cutting, grinding or welding out of doors. Use of any other spark emitting internal combustion engine, not specifically mentioned, is not allowed.

The harvest of agricultural crops is exempt from this restriction.

 

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this declaration/proclamation shall continue in effect until fire danger conditions have sufficiently diminished, at which time this declaration/proclamation shall be rescinded.

IN WITNESS THEREOF, I hereunto set my hand and cause the seal of the City of Bandon to be affixed on this 10th day of September, 2020
