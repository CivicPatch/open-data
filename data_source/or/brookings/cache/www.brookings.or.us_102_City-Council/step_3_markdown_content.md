## About the City Council

The Brookings City Council is dedicated to serving the community by making informed decisions that translate into lasting City improvements.

The City of Brookings has a non-partisan council / manager form of government and its members, a mayor and four councilors, are elected at large and serve in a volunteer capacity.

## Public Meeting Law (PML) Grievances

Brookings meeting bodies, including the City Council and all commissions and committees, are subject to [Oregon’s Public Meetings Law (PML)](https://www.oregon.gov/ogec/public-meetings-law/pages/default.aspx). Violations of the PML should be reported through the grievance process outlined by state law and the Oregon Government Ethics Commission (OGEC). To report a violation of the PML by a Brookings meeting body, submit a written grievance statement to the Office of the City Recorder by email to bosterhage@brookings.or.us or in-person at City Hall (898 Elk Drive). Once received the City will initiate the process as outlined by the OGEC (see link above).
