Mike Schaufler was recently appointed Mayor. He has a BA from the University of Iowa in Political Science and has been active in government over the years, including a decade in the Oregon State Legislature for House District 48. He is a father of one and is employed as a correctional officer. He says, “Turner is a great place to live. Just like most small towns that are within commuting distance of a large metropolitan area, Turner faces some serious challenges. But we can manage those challenges with hard work and well thought out planning. One thing I've learned as a child ,and has been shown to be so true throughout my life, is that the listener learns the most. That's why I have attached my personal phone number and email address to this message. I very much look forward to hearing from you.” 503-421-4340

Turner, Oregon, was a place of choice when my husband and I moved here in 2013 from Bend, Oregon. Previously we had lived 30 years in the Portland area where Henry taught public school. Our families had ties here since the 1970s and found the town friendly plus a great place to retire. Through the years raising our 4 children, we always were active in our neighborhoods, local and national adult/youth Church activities including 4-H. My plan is to continue making this lovely Turner even a better place for others of all ages to enjoy the fruits of a Good Neighbor City."

We chose to move our family to Turner ten years ago because of the warm and community-centered nature of this unique small town. Our four children graduated from Cascade High School, but gathering together at home is still something we all look forward to. Aside from spending time with my family, I'm often found working in the yard, or out walking our dogs. I'm looking forward to serving the community that's contributed so much to myself and my family as a member of the council.
