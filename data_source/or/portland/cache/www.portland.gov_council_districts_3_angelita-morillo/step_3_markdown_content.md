[District 3](https://www.portland.gov/council/districts/3)

I'm one of three councilors representing District 3 (inner Southeast Portland, reaching north to Sandy Blvd. and east to I-205.). As a Paraguayan immigrant and Portlander who has experienced homelessness here, I know how important it is to have those impacted by the issues in decision making spaces.
