## Biography

Brian Whitaker, originally from Delaware County, PA, moved to New Castle, Delaware as a child. Growing up, Brian was active in a variety of extracurriculars, including Boy Scouts, Little League Baseball, and band. He later developed an interest in wrestling, served as the football manager, and was involved in student council during high school. After graduating in 1995, he became engaged in politics through the Democratic Party and served on the Separation Day Committee for the City of New Castle, celebrating Delaware's historical significance.

Brian earned a degree from Wilmington College in 2001, where he was involved in student government and focused on accessibility issues, notably helping address gas station accessibility across Delaware. His career has included work in education, social services, and public policy, including a role with the Healthy Delawareans for Disabilities committee. Brian also served in the Delaware Army National Guard and later joined Active Duty, where he served in South Korea, Germany, Kuwait, and Iraq, earning multiple awards, including the Good Conduct Medal.

After returning to Delaware in 2010, Brian ran for Mayor and continued his work in social services, earning a Master's in Human Services. He was appointed to the Board for Speech Pathology, Audiology, and Hearing Aid Dispensers, and served as City Clerk for New Castle, where he spearheaded initiatives like the Veterans Community Garden. He later ran for New Castle County Council President and New Castle City Council President before transitioning to business ownership and community service.

Now residing in Central Point, Oregon, Brian operates Whitaker’s Business Entities LLC, which includes several subsidiaries and nonprofits. He also became a first-time homeowner, navigated personal challenges, and began serving his community in Oregon. In 2024, Brian ran for City Council and was elected with 98% of the vote. He continues to serve the community and looks forward to hosting the Grapplers Summit in 2025 for Grapplers for Autism Inc.

Outside of politics and business, Brian enjoys the outdoors, trucks, and is a purple belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. A fun fact about Brian is that he is composing a Sonata for four hands in Arabic keys and rhythms, which has already been recorded in Spain.
