## Biography

Kelley is grateful for the opportunity to be working with the Central Point City Council. They are a great team to be a part of and their pride and love for our community is infectious. She hopes her business and project experience, along with volunteer work, will bring added value to our community goals and vision.

She currently works at Timber Products Company, in a manufacturing environment. Alongside her peers, they are bringing new and updated technologies to the physical locations. This effort makes the lives of the employees more efficient, accurate, and less time-consuming. Change is difficult for all concerned, and she excels at helping teams manage through the transition.

Kelley worked at Harry and David for 23 years in various departments, and has worked with some incredible people over the years. She built a unique bond and obtained a second family while working for a place deemed a "Christmas Company." She thinks of her Harry and David co-workers often.

She loves living in Southern Oregon, and particularly in the Central Point. She grew up here participating in local sports, choir, 4-H, and FFA while attending Scenic Middle School and Crater High School.

She is most proud of her work with a local recreational flight club called the Rogue Valley Hang Gliding and Paragliding Club (RVHPA). It provided her the opportunity to work with and experience the creation of a non-profit organization. Navigating the IRS regulations takes patience in order to see the process through. Not only did this effort save the club financially, but they also saved vital access for the sport within the local area by procuring Woodrat Mountain as a recreational site with the BLM. It was an incredible experience with a club whose membership history dates back to 1973 in the Applegate Valley. It is now a viable non-profit organization providing flight education through sponsored events. Those early efforts led the current officers into managing a nationally recognized annual flying event, as well as offering charity opportunities that give back to the local community.
