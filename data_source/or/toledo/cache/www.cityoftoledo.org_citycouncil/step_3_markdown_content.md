##### CITY COUNCIL GOALS

***The mission of the Toledo City Government is to provide efficient and necessary public service that protect and enhance the quality of life in Toledo, now and in the future, as determined by our citizens, the law and available economic resources.***

Annually, goals are adopted by the Toledo City Council to guide the Council’s work through the fiscal year, and to give direction to staff on the prioritized projects they will undertake in this fiscal year.

In pursuing all these Goals, the Council and Staff consider and pursue sustainable products, services, and programs, reflecting the three legs of sustainability: environmental, economic, and social.

**2024-2025 GOALS**

- To enhance and sustain public infrastructure and facilities by implementing plans for parks, storm water, and street improvements, upgrading water lines, improving fire infrastructure, and evaluating the City fleet in order to create a safe, efficient, and sustainable environment for residents and visitors.
- The City will focus on advancing technology while simultaneously implementing measures to ensure security and redundancy.
- To sustain and expand an inclusive and welcoming work environment, with a focus on enhancing retention rates.
- Enhance civic engagement and transparency by implementing a comprehensive community outreach program fostering open communication, educating residents about government initiatives, and actively involving community members in decision-making processes to achieve effective local governance.
- Improve emergency preparedness by updating our Emergency Operations Plan by the end of the fiscal year.
- Encourage economic development by developing barrier reducing policies and plans to attract business investments, obtaining grants for commercial rehabilitation, and to support housing development.
