# Councilor Scott Smith

![Scott Smith](https://www.cityofprineville.com/sites/default/files/styles/full_node_primary/public/imageattachments/citycouncil/page/2680/scottsmith_-_scotts_preferred_photo.jpg?itok=2u6LtrtM)

Scott was born and raised in Prineville.  His family were pioneers to the country with both his paternal Grandmother and aunt being Pioneer Queens.  

Scott graduated from Crook County High School in 1984 and immediately followed in his father's footsteps into the excavation field.  He worked building logging roads for a local construction business until 1987, when he had the opportunity to go to work for the City of Prineville Public Works Department.  Scott worked 34 years for the City on the street department, with the last 20 years of which he served as the Street Superintendent.  Scott retired from the City at the end of 2021.  Shortly before his retirement he was awarded Pavement Manager of the Year from the Northwest Pavement Management Association.

Scott is married to Ronda and has thoroughly enjoyed the 2 grandkids that Ronda brought to the marriage.  Scott enjoys sports, camping and watching the grandkids participate in sports and activities.  Probably his biggest passion is working.  Since his retirement he has continued to work off and on driving truck or doing a job for a friend with the family backhoe.

In running for City Council and being elected Scott has no hidden agenda.  Scott is proud of the work he did while a city employee and hopes his position on the Council will allow him to see some of the unfinished projects to be completed.  Allow other city employees to grow and achieve the satisfaction that his career provided.  Scott says his time on the Council will be his opportunity to give back to the community that has gave so much to him.
