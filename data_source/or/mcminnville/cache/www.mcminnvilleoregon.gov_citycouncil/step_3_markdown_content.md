# City Council

The Council is the policy-making body of the city. They adopt laws and regulations, adopt annual City goals and objectives and adopt budgets providing a wide range of public services. They give direction to city staff through the City Manager  who serves at the pleasure of the City Council.  The Mayor is the leader of the governing body and presides over the council meetings.  The mayor only votes in the case of a tie vote by the city councilors.

Meetings are held the second and fourth Tuesdays of each month at 7:00 p.m. in the McMinnville Civic Hall at 200 NE 2nd Street. City Council meetings are a foundational element of McMinnville governance allowing Citizens an opportunity to speak to their elected officials directly and to watch governance in action. Each session is open to the public, streamed live and replayed on local community TV channels. All material is also posted on the City's website before each meeting and material is retained on the site for historical purposes.

As a lifelong resident of McMinnville, I am deeply connected to this community—this is truly my hometown. I graduated from McMinnville High School and married my high school sweetheart over 45 years ago.

For over 37 years, I have been a small business owner, believing strongly that small businesses are the backbone of our local economy. My husband and I owned and operated Morris Carpet Cleaning for more than 35 years, and in 2008, I earned my degree in Interior Design, a profession I continue to this day. Supporting McMinnville’s local economy has always been important to me, and I am proud to be a member of the McMinnville Chamber of Commerce.

Beyond business, I am passionate about community service and believe in the power of partnerships to create meaningful change. I believe in giving back and encourage others to do the same when they can—together, we can accomplish more than we ever could alone. I currently serve on the following boards, With Courage and LoveLikeMikalynn, and as Mayor, I am honored to serve as a Commissioner on the McMinnville Water &amp; Light Commission.

In 2022, I founded the McMinnville Community Task Force to address rising crime concerns, working alongside dedicated community members to promote safety and awareness. My commitment to public service led me to run for Mayor in 2024, driven by a strong belief in enhancing safety, livability, and transparency in our city.

I’m not one to sit back and watch—I believe in taking action. As your Mayor, I will work hard to stay informed, communicate openly, and listen to your concerns. I am here to serve the citizens of McMinnville, and I welcome your input. Please feel free to reach out to me.

I am passionate about service to our city! I have been working hard for years to give back and do my part to create and sustain a McMinnville in which we all can thrive.  Community service is important to me as a husband, father, and citizen.

I am proud to be a native McMinnvillian. After graduating McMinnville High School in 2004, I attended the University of Oregon to study Political Science and History. Professionally, after working with a local construction firm for nearly a decade, I have partnered to start my own construction company, Branch Geary Inc. Prior to my governmental services, I have spent time on the boards for McMinnville Downtown Association, the McMinnville City Club, Yamhill County Parks and Recreation, Nourish Yamhill Valley, and the Walnut City Music Festival. In addition, prior to my election to City Council, I served as vice-chair of the McMinnville Planning Commission.  I bring my passion, energy, and creativity to the McMinnville City Council, continuing to work hard to keep our town unique and livable for current and future residents.

We all recognize that McMinnville is a special place. I intend to preserve, enhance, and build on the things that make us special – parks, schools, services, people, and vision. McMinnville is ready to move forward together, towards a bright future, where we provide for all our citizens in a comprehensive way.  I am eager to do my part.

When not working, I enjoy spending time with my lovely wife Samantha and our son Hiram – reading, playing, running, exploring, and laughing.

As your City Councilor, it is my goal to fully represent you. Your input will always be welcome and deserving of my response. 

“The strength of government and the happiness of the governed is the freedom of the common people to mutually and naturally support each other.” – Thomas Paine

Scott Cunningham has been a small business owner in McMinnville since 2011. Shortly after opening local eatery Community Plate he was asked to join the Board of the McMinnville Downtown Association. He served on the board for more than seven years eventually holding the office of President.

Scott was appointed to the McMinnville Budget Committee in 2022. During that time, he helped navigate the very difficult balancing of the needs of the community and the ever-challenging level of resources to meet those needs.

Scott sought and won election to McMinnville City Council’s Ward 3 representative in 2024.

“I look forward to serving all of my neighbors in Ward 3. I have been placed on several committees that will have a direct impact on our community. Affordable Housing and Housing Strategies are integral to the future of maintaining our hometown. That as well as Historic Landmarks, Third Street Improvement Project and being a liaison to MCM 11 (our local tv broadcast channel) are sure to keep me busy.”

A fun fact: upon winning election Scott set out to “Walk the Ward” and it took him and his dog Auggie 168 miles to traverse it’s entirety. And he is committed to continuing this boots and paws approach.
