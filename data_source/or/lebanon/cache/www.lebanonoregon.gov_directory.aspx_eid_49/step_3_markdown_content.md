## Biography

### Professional

Currently the Chief Recovery Officer at LinnCo Federal Credit Union and am a Certified Financial Counselor and Certified Lending Expert.

### Personal

Married to my wife, Renee, for 35 years. We have two beautiful grown daughters who live here in Lebanon with our 1-year old grandson.

### Community Involvement

My family on both sides has been here in Lebanon since the 1940's. I live in a house my grandparents built in 1965, next to the one they built in the 40's. Almost every good memory I have is here in this town. My hope is to keep this a town where citizens can be safe, secure and prosperous while maintaining the small-town values that many hold so dear.

I was on the City Planning Commission and have volunteered for many things, including coaching for the Boys and Girls Club, working at Brewfest, the Pumpkin Run and Kidz Shop.

I look forward to serving Lebanon as a City Councilor here in Ward 2.
