[mreyes@tualatin.gov](mailto:mreyes@tualatin.gov)   
Position 1

Councilor María Antonieta Reyes was first elected November 2018, and re-elected on November 2022. Councilor Reyes has a diverse background in human services and nonprofit management for over 25 years. She became a volunteer in 2016, serving on the Tualatin Tomorrow Committee and Diversity Task Force.

Councilor Reyes was born in rural Honduras and immigrated to inner-city Los Angeles at age 5. During her professional career, she has lived in California, Washington D.C., and Oregon, settling in Tualatin in 2012. Councilor Reye's experience in mega cities like L.A. and Washington D.C. have also increased her focus on better transportation in growing communities. She is committed to providing faster transportation and better access for commuters between Tualatin and other metro cities.

While part of her life has been in large metro areas, she also has exposure to small communities like her birth-town of Catacamas, a rural town in Honduras. From an early age, she saw firsthand the struggle of poverty in a developing country. This experience directed her to the field of Human Services, and she continually looks for ways to elevate families to a better existence. 

As a city councilor, she is honored to serve on the Council Committee Advisory committee and Core Area committee. She was also a catalyst in starting the Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Access committee (IDEA). She attends TuaLatinos and Cafe con Pan Dulce (a Latino business network) at the Library. 

Councilor Reyes loves Tualatin. She rarely leaves the city; you will see her shopping at the local businesses, eating at restaurants, using the health and fitness locations (Zumba being her favorite activity), and walking and riding her bike around town. Tualatin is very important to her, and she hopes all residents can enjoy it just as much as she does.
