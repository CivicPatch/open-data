From an early age, she saw firsthand the struggle of poverty in a developing country. This experience directed her to the field of Human Services, and she continually looks for ways to elevate families to a better existence. As a city councilor, she is honored to serve on the Council Committee Advisory committee and Core Area committee. She was also a catalyst in starting the Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Access committee (IDEA). She attends TuaLatinos and Cafe con Pan Dulce (a Latino business network) at the Library.

She rarely leaves the city; you will see her shopping at the local businesses, eating at restaurants, using the health and fitness locations (Zumba being her favorite activity), and walking and riding her bike around town. Tualatin is very important to her, and she  hopes all  residents  can  enjoy it just as much as she does. |
