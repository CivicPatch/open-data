#### **Notice of Receipt of Ballot Title- Allowing Marijuana Retail Facilities, Impose 3% Recreational Marijuana Sales Tax**

Notice is hereby given that on May 2, 2024 the City Elections Official, Lilly Alarcon-Strong, of the City of Hermiston received a citizen prospective initiative petition that complies with constitutional requirements for the General Election of November 5, 2024. Any voter dissatisfied with the ballot title may file a petition for review in the Umatilla County Circuit Court no later than 5:00pm on May 17, 2024 and notify the City Elections Official by said date.

View the [**Initiative Petition**](https://www.hermiston.gov/sites/default/files/fileattachments/mayor_amp_city_council/page/16395/sel_370_initiative_petition.pdf) and [**Authorized Agent**](https://www.hermiston.gov/sites/default/files/fileattachments/mayor_amp_city_council/page/16395/sel_307_authorized_agent.pdf).

 

The text of the ballot title is as follows:

 

BALLOT TITLE: ALLOWS MARIJUANA RETAIL FACILITIES, IMPOSES 3% RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA SALES TAX.

 

QUESTION: SHALL THE CITY OF HERMISTON ALLOW MARIJUANA RETAIL FACILITIES AND COLLECT A 3% TAX ON RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA RETAIL SALES?

 

SUMMARY: A citizen ballot initiative was initiated to amend Title XV, Chapter157 allowing marijuana retail facilities within Hermiston.  This measure repeals the prohibition on marijuana retail facilities within the city adopted by Hermiston voters in November 2016. Title XV, Chapter 157 of the Hermiston Municipal Code currently prohibits all marijuana-related businesses within the city. This measure amends Title XV, Chapter 157 to allow marijuana retail facilities licensed by the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission that are licensed to sell marijuana directly to a consumer in the State of Oregon.  This measure also does the following: 1) It creates various requirements for placement and operation of marijuana retail facilities; 2) It imposes a 3% local tax on all recreational marijuana items sold by marijuana retailers, to be used for general government purposes; and 3) It includes provisions for the City to enforce and collect the 3% tax.

 

A "Yes" vote allows marijuana retail facilities in the City of Hermiston, with a 3% tax on marijuana retail sales.  
A "No" vote continues the prohibition on all marijuana-related businesses.

#### **Elected Official Information**

There are 10 elected city positions in Hermiston:

- 8 City Councilors
- 1 Mayor
- 1 Municipal Judge

This guide describes the requirements and responsibilities of elected officials in the City of Hermiston and an overview of the local election process. For detailed background on the process, refer to [**Hermiston’s City Charter and Municipal Code.**](https://www.codepublishing.com/OR/Hermiston)

In addition to understanding Hermiston’s regulations, candidates also need to be aware of State requirements, and should reference the current publications posted on the [**Oregon Secretary of State Elections Division website**](https://sos.oregon.gov/elections/Pages/laws-rules-publications.aspx). In addition, the [**Umatilla County Elections website**](https://www.co.umatilla.or.us/elections/index.html) is a valuable resource for local candidates.

## **About the City’s Form of Government**

Hermiston uses a “Council-Manager” form of government, similar to the large majority of Oregon cities.  In a Council-Manager form of government, all powers of the City are vested in the City Council.  The Council, made up of 8 elected Hermiston residents, ultimately decides whether or not the City will take action on matters concerning the City. The Mayor is elected separately from the City Council, and only votes in the event of a tie. The Council hires a City Manager to manage day-to-day operations and department heads.

## **What is Expected of Elected Officials**

Elected officials occupy positions of public trust and must adhere to all State, local, and Federal Laws, as well as Oregon Laws of Government Ethics. Elected officials are expected to:

- Read and review agenda packets and information prior to attending meetings
- Attend two (2) regularly scheduled City Council Meetings each month
- In addition to attending other special and assigned monthly meetings of the City, to include:
  
  - Work Session meetings
  - Committee meetings
  - Board meetings and
  - City Administration meetings
- Elected officials are encouraged to attend seminars and conferences in order to continue their education and knowledge of all aspects that affect the community in which they serve
- [**City Council Rules of Order and Procedure**](https://www.codepublishing.com/OR/Hermiston/)

## **Ward &amp; At-Large Positions**

Half of the City Councilors are elected by "wards," which means that they live within that ward and must remain a resident of that ward throughout their term in office; however, all councilors are elected by all city residents. [**Find the ward you live in.**](https://www.hermiston.or.us/sites/default/files/fileattachments/mayor_amp_city_council/page/9511/city_council_wards.pdf)

The Mayor, At-Large Councilors, and Municipal Court Judge are “At-Large” positions, which means they may live anywhere within City limits.

#### **Election Process**

### FOR: At-Large Council Candidates.

Candidates will run only in the General Election. The four (4) candidates receiving the highest number of votes shall be elected into office.

### FOR: Mayor, Ward Specific Council, and Municipal Court Judge Candidates.

If, at the May primary election two (2) or less candidates file nomination petitions or declarations of candidacy for the position of Mayor, Ward Specific Councilor, or Municipal Judge, then the primary election shall be considered the general election.

If three (3) or more candidates file, then the May Primary Election shall be considered the primary election and the two (2) candidates receiving the highest number of votes shall be the nominees whose names shall appear on the ballot for the November General Election.  However, should any candidate receive a majority of all votes cast for the office at the May primary election, then the name of that candidate shall be printed separately on the ballot at the general election under the designation equivalent to “Vote for One” and no other name shall be printed on the ballot in opposition to such candidate, with the exception of one space left blank following such name in which the voter may insert the name of any person for whom the voter wishes to cast a ballot.
