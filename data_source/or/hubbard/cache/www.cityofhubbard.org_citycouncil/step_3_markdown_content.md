# City Council

The Council is composed of a Mayor and four Council members elected from the city at large. The Mayor is elected for a term of two years, presides over deliberations of the Council, and is a voting member. The four Council members are elected, each for a term of four years. A resident is eligible for an elective office of the City if, at the time of the election, he/she is a qualified elector within the meaning of the state constitution and has resided in the City during the twelve months immediately preceding the elections.

The City Council's function within the city is two-fold; to enact city code through the passage of ordinances, and to help build a common vision for Hubbard through creative and representative municipal policy-making. They also help to connect the community and the city government, integrating the voices of the citizens into the creation of policy.

The City Council meets on the second Tuesday of every month. Meetings are held at City Hall in the Council Chambers, 3720 Second Street. If you have something you need to talk with the City Council about, you may call or [E-Mail](mailto:vlnogle@cityofhubbard.org) the Director of Administration/City Recorder, Vickie Nogle, MMC to schedule your item to be discussed with the City Council. The City Hall phone number is 503-981-9633. ([E-Mail](mailto:vlnogle@cityofhubbard.org))

Agendas are posted at City Hall and on the City [website](https://www.cityofhubbard.org/meetings). This meeting location is wheelchair accessible.  Disabled individuals requiring other assistance must make their request known 48 hours preceding the meeting by contacting the Director of Administration/City Recorder.  The City will, upon request, endeavor to arrange the following services to be provided.  Since these services must be scheduled with outside service providers it is important to allow as much lead time as possible. (Qualified sign language interpreters for persons with speech or hearing impairments; Qualified bilingual interpreters; and Assisting listening devices for persons with impaired hearing.)
