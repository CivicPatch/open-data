**Elisabeth Adams**

[Ward 3](https://astoria.gov/Assets/dept_1/pm/pdf/wardmap3_2012.pdf)  
[eadams@astoria.gov](mailto:eadams@astoria.gov)   
503-325-5824 (City Hall)  
503-298-2408 (Voice)

As a lifelong Oregonian, proud mother of three daughters, and a dedicated public servant, Elisabeth is committed to building strong, vibrant, healthy communities. Raised in Svensen, a small area outside of Astoria, she brings a deep knowledge of rural representation to her work.

Elisabeth serves as the Ward 3 Astoria City Councilor. Her work on Council has included creating Housing for All Astorians policies, development of parks and open spaces, fostering partnerships with the business community, and providing support for arts and culture programs. She meets regularly with constituents and hosts events to encourage civic engagement with local government.

She is proud to represent the City of Astoria on the Local Officials Advisory Committee (LOAC) of the Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD), Northwest Area Commission on Transportation (NW ACT), Clatsop County Regional Housing Task Force, and Clatsop County’s Homelessness Response Multi-Agency Coordination (MAC) Group. She has also sought opportunities to work with our state legislature to ensure that the needs of our rural residents are represented and funding is equitably provided.

Elisabeth attended Clatsop Community College and East West College of the Healing Arts. She has spent over two decades advocating for access to quality healthcare in her work as a public health Americorps VISTA volunteer, founding member of Coastal Family Health Center, and longtime doula and La Leche League leader.

Elisabeth also has a background in transportation and infrastructure. As a mobility manager and transportation options coordinator, she specialized in supporting seniors and people with disabilities by promoting compliance and improving quality of life through transportation education.

As the daughter of a longshoreman and supporter of working-class industry, she believes in the importance and success of our unique local economy. She is a licensed massage therapist and small business owner in a historic downtown Astoria building and is proud to contribute to a vital commercial district and support other local entrepreneurs and businesses.

Elisabeth enjoys all the outdoor activities the area has to offer, from hiking, camping, kayaking, and adventures with her daughters and her dog.
