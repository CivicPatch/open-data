# Councilor Janine Gladfelter

#### Term of Office: January 2023 to December 2026

![Gresham City Councilor Janine Gladfelter](https://www.greshamoregon.gov/globalassets/government/mayor-and-council/meet-the-council/councilor-gladfelter-portrait.jpg)Councilor Janine Gladfelter was elected to a second term in November 2022 and sworn into office in Position 6 on Jan. 3, 2023.

Councilor Gladfelter has been a leader in Gresham for 18 years through her career at U.S. Bank and her time on the Council. Councilor Gladfelter has been out in the community, volunteering, building relationships, and being a trusted advisor and a point of resource for businesses, nonprofits, and community members.

She was appointed in 2017, elected in 2018 and sworn into office in 2019.

Councilor Gladfelter served as Council President in 2020 and served on both the City’s Finance and Community Development Block Grant committees for four years before continuing as Council Liaison. She also served as Council Liaison for the Historic Resources Committee and A Home for Everyone for two years.

Her experience serving on the City Council has given her an even deeper understanding and opportunity for the need to create and promote policies and programs to encourage safe neighborhoods, clean streets, and economic prosperity for all.

Councilor Gladfelter’s priorities are public safety, long-term financial stability, livability, and ensuring we have housing available at all levels.

In her free time, you will see her out with her husband walking her dogs. She also enjoys cooking and gardening – and sharing with friends and family.
