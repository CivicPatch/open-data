#### Term of Office: January 2025 to December 2028

 ![Gresham City Councilor Sue Piazza](images/1707fc822c45c8c1c50f2d240e03ed4f5903b2a6d3dbf948b5a9d19dc0ebc896.jpg) Councilor Sue Piazza was elected to a second term on Nov. 5, 2024, and sworn into office in Position 5 on Jan. 7, 2025.

She was elected to a first term in November 2020 and sworn into office in January 2021.

She brings her business acumen and passion for Gresham to her role on the City Council. As a lifelong area resident, first in Damascus then in Gresham after graduation from Sam Barlow High School, she appreciates the many opportunities Gresham has provided its citizens. She grew up with Gresham values and raised her two sons here, teaching them that their multicultural heritage helped enrich the neighborhoods they lived in.

Councilor Piazza is a self-described serial entrepreneur. Since her mid-20s she has put energy into being a business owner. First with the pizza manufacturing business, then a local real estate agent, and a wellness and business coach. She was also able to turn her passion for travel into a business, becoming a travel professional.

Throughout her business endeavors, her dedication to giving back to her community has never waned. Councilor Piazza has spent the last 40 years donating her time to nonprofits and social organizations to help improve the lives and education of those in our community, especially our children.

"I am enthusiastic about Gresham," she says. "It has always been a great place to live, work, and play. I will work hard to keep it safe, vibrant, and economically healthy for future generations."

Councilor Piazza’s primary committee assignments include the Planning Commission and the Earthquake Ready Burnside Bridge Policy Group. Additionally, she serves as an alternate for the Design Commission and the Regional Disaster Preparedness Organization. She was voted Council President by her colleagues in 2023.
