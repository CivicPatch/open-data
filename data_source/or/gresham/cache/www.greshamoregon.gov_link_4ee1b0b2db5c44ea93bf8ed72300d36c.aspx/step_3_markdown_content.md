# Councilor Kayla Brown

#### Term of Office: January 2025 to December 2028

 ![Kayla Brown](images/22954e29c947c3c87a21dd0a595f32e93b10d7a9e681919cbac367fb582305c8.jpg) Councilor Kayla Brown was elected to a four-year term on Nov. 5, 2024, and sworn into office in Position 1 on Jan. 7, 2025.

Councilor Brown is a well-known small business owner of a thriving bakery in Gresham’s Historic Downtown. Beginning her entrepreneurial journey in her early 20s, she has always been self-motivated and an exceptionally hard worker. She earned an associate’s degree in graphic design from Mt. Hood Community College and enjoys applying her creative skills whenever possible.

She grew up in Vancouver, Wash., where she attended Evergreen High School. Just eight days after graduating, she moved across the river to Gresham, where she has been a resident for over 15 years. She and her husband purchased a home in the Rockwood neighborhood 13 years ago and have cherished raising their two young daughters there. As a wife, mother, business owner, and community volunteer, Councilor Brown understands the challenges of balancing numerous responsibilities and strives to be a relatable and approachable councilor to Gresham residents.

As the former president of the Historic Downtown Gresham Association and an eight-year board member, Councilor Brown is passionate about fostering connections between the community and City initiatives. She aims to bridge the gap in communication, participation and collaboration between businesses, residents, and local government.

In addition to her role on the Council, she has served as a Gresham Planning Commissioner and volunteers actively through her local church. She is deeply invested in Gresham’s future and is committed to being a strong voice for the community. Councilor Brown’s focus is on finding creative and efficient solutions to address the challenges the city faces.

She lives by the mantra of seizing opportunities whenever they arise and learning along the way.

“I love throwing myself into new challenges; it’s how I learn and understand people better.”

She hopes to bring this enthusiasm to her role on the council and inspire other strong leaders to step forward and get involved.
