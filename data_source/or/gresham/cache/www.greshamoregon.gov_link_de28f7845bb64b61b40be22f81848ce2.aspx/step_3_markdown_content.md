# Councilor Cathy Keathley

#### Term of Office: January 2025 to December 2028

![Cathy Keathley](https://www.greshamoregon.gov/globalassets/government/mayor-and-council/meet-the-council/cathy-keathley-portrait.jpg)Councilor Cathy Keathley was elected to a four-year term on Nov. 5, 2024, and sworn into office in Position 3 on Jan. 7, 2025.

Councilor Keathley brings a deep commitment and a wealth of experience to Gresham in her role as City Councilor. She served previously as a Gresham City Council member. She combines institutional knowledge with a passion for public service. Her extensive background includes work in Human Resources at Metro and the City of Gresham, providing her with a strong understanding of municipal operations and personnel management.

Throughout her career, Councilor Keathley has demonstrated a commitment to public safety and community collaboration. She served as Chair of the Fire Advisory Committee when the City explored the creation of a fire district, and her close connection to public safety continues as her husband is retired from fire and her son currently serves as a firefighter in Gresham.

A lifelong resident of Gresham, Councilor Keathley has dedicated decades of service to local schools and nonprofits, actively raising thousands of dollars to support organizations that strengthen the fabric of Gresham. In 2021, she was elected to the Gresham-Barlow School Board and served as Vice Chair, where she worked to ensure transparency, accountability and student success.

As City Councilor, she knows it is essential for government to be efficient with tax dollars, making every dollar effectively serve the best interests and needs of the community. She is passionate about building trust with residents by prioritizing transparency in the City’s decision-making process, particularly when it comes to how taxpayer dollars are spent. She is committed to fostering a thriving and safe Gresham for all.
