# Councilor President Jerry Hinton

#### Term of Office: January 2023 to December 2026

 ![Councilor Jerry Hinton](images/2921c75b16045571c8d11bb4460d61951f5c194bcb6018ec5f3085a48efb3d11.jpg) Council President Jerry W. Hinton was elected to a third term in November 2022 and sworn into office in Position 4 on Jan. 3, 2023.

Council President Hinton served his first four-year term in 2013 and his second term in 2017. He was voted Council President by his colleagues in 2015, 2019 and again in 2025.

Before joining Council, he served on Gresham’s Citizen Involvement and Finance committees.

Council President Hinton and his family have lived in Gresham since 2003. He is a retired automotive executive and currently serves as an automotive-industry consultant. He was President and later Chairman of the Board of the National Auto Auction Association.

His passion for Gresham is to build and sustain a safe, thriving, family-oriented community by fostering community pride through volunteer service, and by providing opportunities and programs for children and families. He strives to improve neighborhood safety and livability and create long-term stability of the City’s finances through economic development, job creation, and sound fiscal policies.

“It is not government’s duty to only maintain the safety of its citizens but to also help increase the collective quality of life for all. In doing so, we are empowered through our diversity as it makes our vision clearer while recognizing that our families will always provide our core.”

Council President Hinton enjoys many outdoor activities with his family, as well as serving his church and community. He loves international travel and experiencing new people and cultures. As a young man, he served the Aymara Indians for two years as a missionary for his church in the Andes mountains of Bolivia, speaking both Aymara and Spanish. He lived in a remote area at 14,000 feet in a mud hut with no running water or electricity and treasures the people and life experiences he gained there.
