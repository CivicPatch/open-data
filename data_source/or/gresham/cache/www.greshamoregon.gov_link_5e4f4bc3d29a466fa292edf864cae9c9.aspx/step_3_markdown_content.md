#### Term of Office: January 2023 to December 2026

![Mayor Travis Stovall](https://www.greshamoregon.gov/globalassets/government/mayor-and-council/meet-the-council/mayor-stovall-portrait.jpg)Mayor Travis Stovall, sworn into office on Jan. 3, 2023, was elected to his second term in November 2022.

Mayor Stovall was first sworn in as Gresham's 28th Mayor on Jan. 5, 2021. He served the rest of former Mayor Shane Bemis' term through December 2022.

Mayor Stovall makes history as Gresham's first Black mayor and of any major city in the Portland metro area and across the state. His life experiences and leadership guide the City and community forward at a time when unity has never been more important.

A longtime Gresham resident, he is the small business owner and CEO of eRep, Inc.

He is a former vice president of the TriMet Board of Directors and featured in The Oregonian for his dynamic leadership when serving as President of the Board of Directors of the Gresham Area Chamber of Commerce and Visitors Center.

Mayor Stovall’s lengthy history of volunteer local government service includes serving on the City's Community Development and Housing Subcommittee; chair of the Charter Review Committee; and the past Gresham Task Force on Housing to help create affordable housing units.

As Mayor, his priorities include the City's budget; community safety; making sure families, individuals and businesses have the support needed to recover from COVID-19; and building housing that is affordable for Gresham at every income level.

Mayor Stovall holds a Bachelor of Science from Union College in business administration, with an emphasis in finance, where he graduated summa cum laude. He graduated with a Master’s in business administration from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

In his free time, Mayor Stovall is a private pilot, plays tennis, cycles and enjoys spending time traveling.
