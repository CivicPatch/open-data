#  Council Members 

Sherwood's City Council is made up of a Mayor and six Councilor positions, including that of Council President. The Mayor presides over Council meetings and, in the Mayor's absence, the Council President may substitute in the performance of mayoral duties. The Council members are elected for four-year terms of office through a general election, except when a position is vacated before term completion and filled by special appointment of the Council. The Mayor is elected to a two-year term.  The Council is governed by Sherwood City Charter and adopted Council Rules.

The Council makes appointments to and considers the recommendations of all City Boards, Commissions and Committees; reviews staff reports in conjunction with regular council meetings, participates in the deliberation of agenda items, enacts legislation, and participates in a number of regional meetings and meetings with other government agencies and jurisdictions, as needed.

Term: 2 years, expires January 2027

Tim is originally from Dayton Ohio, and moved to the Sherwood area in 1975 with his family.  He grew up roaming the hills and woods between Newberg and Sherwood, walking the railroad tracks into Sherwood and Newberg to visit his friends and the local arcades, and spend the money he earned picking strawberries.

After graduating High School in 1984 in Newberg, he enlisted in the Air Force, working as a Helicopter Search and Rescue Crew Chief at Vandenberg Air Force Base. In 1987, he transferred to the USAF Reserves and started a new career as a software engineer for a small local software company.

In 1997, he met his future wife Sharon. In their first year as a couple, they built a house in Woodhaven and got married. In 2004, they took a big step and started a family with the birth of their daughter Anna, followed by the birth of twins, Jack and Molli 3 years later. All three of their kids attend Sherwood schools.

Tim has a passion for local government. As a leader and small business owner, the majority of his 33-year career was focused on delivering innovative technology and consulting services to over 900 local governments across the United States.  He provided software solutions that helped cities with everything from running finance and payroll to planning and zoning, infrastructure asset management, utility billing, permitting, and community outreach/engagement. He spent most of his career on the ground, working with local governments and city councils all across our great country. Since leaving this career, he is now focused on giving back to the community that he lives in.  He enjoys leveraging all he has learned in his career to help his hometown move forward.

Councilor Taylor Giles

 [gilest@sherwoodoregon.gov](mailto:gilest@sherwoodoregon.gov) 

Term: 4 years, expires January 2027

 Taylor Giles was born in Portland, but raised in Palo Alto, CA. After marrying Sarah Oscarson, having 2 kids, and graduating with a degree in Computer Science, he decided to take a family vacation to see the city of his birth. As they drove through Sherwood, it was love at first sight! In 2003, they moved to Sherwood and started to put down roots. Although they were impressed with the school system, they were a bit disappointed by the lack of performing opportunities for their young family. Together, with Cindy Christensen and others, they created the Voices for the Performing Arts Foundation (VPA) with the only provision that board meetings had to be at the Giles house, due to lack of babysitters for their young kids! Taylor designed their first logo, built their first website and served as President. He can still be spotted taking tickets or occasional stage performances. 

 Taylor served as the chair of the Bond Oversite Committee for 3 years to ensure that Sherwood got everything promised in the bond for our beautiful schools. Then he served for 2 years on the Sherwood Planning Commission to help plan Sherwood's responsible growth. He has also served as a volunteer soccer coach, baseball coach, church youth leader, STEM teacher and in multiple roles at city festivals. His other hobbies include cooking, reading, and adventures with his wife and 5 kids (and dog, Pabu). 

 As a Product Manager and then Product Executive, Taylor has worked to improve access to healthcare for most of his career. One thing that he has learned, in his career and public service, is that feedback is crucial to building software and cities. He welcomes feedback, thoughts, and concerns from his Sherwood neighbors about ways to support and grow the city that he loves.
