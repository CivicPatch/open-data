### Mayor Al Muelhoefer

Al was born in Chicago to a family of funeral directors and was first introduced to the world of politics there. Graduating from the University of Wisconsin, he ended up studying political science at the University of Hawaii.  While trying to figure out what to do with his life, the Viet Nam era draft notice arrived at this door. Next thing you know is that he ended up joining the US Air Force and flew the Phantom F-4 fighter aircraft for the next 15 years of his life.  Al was stationed in Korea, Viet Nam, Turkey and Spain. Continuing with the Air Force, Al transitioned into the world of political military affairs with postings in Honolulu, Washington DC and Brussels, Belgium.  As an Air Force Colonel, as worked with US State Department Ambassadors to further US foreign policy objectives. Al’s last Air force assignment was to Dayton, Ohio where he managed international technology negotiations.

Upon retirement, Al wanted to get involved in local communities and was selected to be the Executive Director of Troy, Ohio Main Street.  This is a downtown revitalization organization that uses the National Main Street concept to keep citizens coming downtown rather than going to strip malls and big box stores.  Al was responsible for keeping approximately 100 downtown Troy business locations filled with vibrant businesses that would attract the greater Dayton, Ohio population.

After the loss of his first wife, Al decided to completely change his life and moved to the mouth of the Klamath River, 22 miles south of Crescent City, California. He became a Sierra Club hike leader and enjoyed living in nature. Eventually, he met his current wife, Annie, who comes from an Ashland, Oregon ranching family.  At some point, Annie wanted to return to the Rogue Valley to enjoy the cultural activities that she grew up with.

They settled in Phoenix in 2011 but early on the Phoenix Urban Renewal Agency Board of Directors heard about Al’s background in downtown revitalization and asked him to join their independent group. Soon Al became the Chair and worked with the group to plan what would eventually be the Civic Center.  Al was involved in acquiring all the land for building the Civic Center and the Phoodery. He left the Urban Renewal Board in 2017 when the Agency was transitioning to a board under the City of Phoenix.

Al was elected to the City Council from 2020 until he resigned in 2022 to move to Loreto, Baja, Mexico. While they had a wonderful life living next to the Sea of Cortez, Annie and Al decided to return home. Upon his return to Phoenix in 2024, Al decided to run for Mayor at the urging of many citizens.  Al enjoys representing the citizens of Phoenix and is committed to building a better community. He is excited to see more citizens than ever participating on City Commissions and Committees as well as independent groups working to create and sustain the Phoenix “vibe.”
