## Speaking at a City Council Meeting

### How do I get to speak?

First, sign up to speak by placing your name on the signup sheet. Then, note the agenda item you want to address or leave the agenda item blank. At the start of the meeting, the Mayor will call on you during this section of the Agenda.

### When can I speak?

Citizen Comments is the section of the agenda providing an opportunity for citizens to speak from the floor addressing the Council or Planning Commission or other committees that are not a pending agenda item or issues relevant to the City. Your comments must be limited to three (3) minutes.

### What do I do?

When it is your turn to speak, the Mayor/Chair will acknowledge you by calling your name. At that time, you may come forward to address Council or approach the microphone at this time.

### What do I say?

First, state your name and address while speaking clearly for the record. Then, express your view, ask questions, or offer suggestions in a courteous and considerate manner. This is your opportunity to get your comments into the City’s record.

When addressing the Council or Commission members, it is common to address them by their title as Mayor, Councilor, or Commissioner. Remember to direct all remarks and questions to the Council/Commission and through the Mayor/Chair. This is your opportunity to address Council/Commission; however it is not a conversation. It is appropriate to address the audience or City staff directly. If you have a complaint against a City employee, the Council/Commission meeting is not the place to air it. Please make an appointment with the City Manager.

## Elected Officals

Elected officials serve four year terms, and the the election for these positions are held in November during a General Election. The Mayor and Council serve four-year terms. There are four ward positions and two at-large positions.
