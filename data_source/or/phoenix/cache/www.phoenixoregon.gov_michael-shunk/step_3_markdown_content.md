### Michael Shunk - Councilor

Dr. Michael Shunk and his family moved to Phoenix, Oregon in the summer of 2014, drawn by the area's natural beauty and sense of community.  Which was an intentional shift away from the heat, smog, and congestion of Arizona. Since then, the Shunks have proudly called Phoenix home.

Mike began his local career as a science teacher at Phoenix High School, where he spent three years connecting with students, families, and the broader dynamics of the Rogue Valley. His work in education led him to become a school principal specializing in alternative education, which are programs designed to serve the most at-risk students in our community. In addition to this leadership role, Dr. Shunk serves as President of the Oregon Alternative Education Association, advocating for educational equity and student-centered support statewide.

Previously, Dr. Shunk was appointed and served for 2 years on the Phoenix City Council. During that term, he contributed to the development and implementation of many of the city’s long-term plans, supported funding initiatives for the City Center, and worked to increase community input and transparency in local government. He was especially proud to help shape the Church Street streetscape redesign based on direct resident feedback.

Now returning to the Council, Dr. Shunk is committed to supporting healthy, sustainable growth in Phoenix with a focus on community well-being and resilience. He is particularly passionate about fire-wise strategies and fuel mitigation to reduce wildfire risk, a priority made even more urgent after a recent 30-acre fire broke out behind the Phoenix High School football stadium on the day of his younger son’s graduation.

Dr. Shunk looks forward to continuing to listen, engage, and help lead Phoenix toward a safer, stronger, and more vibrant future.
