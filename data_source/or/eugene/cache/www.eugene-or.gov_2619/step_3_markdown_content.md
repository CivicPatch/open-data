### Personal Statement

I have lived in Eugene for nearly 30 years and I am thrilled to serve the people of Ward 3. As your City Councilor, I will be working to ensure that the City focuses at least some of its efforts in three areas.

First, the City should continue and enhance its efforts to protect our environment and promote sustainability. We need to create a future based on sustainable use of resources, innovative thinking, and creative solutions. It is of particular importance to me that we successfully shepherd into existence the new Office of Sustainability and Citizen Sustainability Commission.

Second, we need to be smart in our approach to development, growth and density; and consider livability and the protection of our neighborhoods in all of our decisions. We need to work harder to preserve the unique character and livability of our neighborhoods, enhance our safety, and reduce the impacts of traffic.

Third, we must have a City government that is fair and open, which listens to its citizens, puts people’s interests above special interests, and gets things done.
