The City of Forest Grove utilizes advisory boards and commissions to guide the City Council on public policy matters impacting the community. These boards and commissions are appointed by the Mayor with the approval of the City Council. Each board or commission varies in size, meeting frequency, and specific responsibilities, but all share the common objective of advising the City Council.

Recruitment for these positions occurs annually; however, applications are accepted throughout the year. **Please be aware that submission of an application does not guarantee an interview.**

## Interview Process

- Upon receipt of your application, the board-specific staff liaison will reach out to schedule an interview. The interview will be conducted by both the staff liaison and the council liaison associated with the board or commission for which you have applied.
- If a recommendation for an appointment is made,
  
  - applicants will be notified by the staff liaison and,
  - your application and the staff recommendation will be included in the City Council Agenda packet. **Please note that your home address and email address will remain confidential and will not be published.**
- Appointments to boards and commissions are formally made by the Mayor with the consent of the City Council. Each term lasts for four years.
