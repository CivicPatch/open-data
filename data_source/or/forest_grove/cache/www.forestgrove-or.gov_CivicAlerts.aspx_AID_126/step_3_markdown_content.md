### Introducing City Councilor Brian Schimmel

![Councilor Brian Schimmel](https://www.forestgrove-or.gov/ImageRepository/Document?documentID=2647)

The City welcomes Councilor Brian Schimmel, a dedicated and visionary leader who brings a passion for service, innovation, and community collaboration to his new role.  

Councilor Schimmel’s journey to public office stems from a commitment to building systems that empower individuals and create sustainable solutions.    
 “I’ve always looked around the room and wondered who's missing and how we can break the barriers to entry while working together to create solutions,” Brian shares.  “My goal is to bolster our community leaders, and staff with a sense of unity to inspire others to work alongside me for the greater good of our community.”

Brian is eager to establish systems that address immediate concerns and set a foundation for long-term success. From housing options to transportation and other infrastructure improvements, he plans to champion policies that prioritize resiliency and effectiveness while inviting diverse voices to the table.  

Beyond the council chambers, Brian is a firm believer in mentorship and inspiration. His two children personally motivated him to start serving in a public service capacity. His service included Meals On Wheels, working on Project Turnkey, a transitional housing shelter, to starting a nonprofit to bolster food banks to aid in the food insecure community.  He is hopeful that his example will inspire the next generation of leaders to step up and contribute to our community with confidence and purpose.  

With a clear vision and a collaborative spirit, Councilor Schimmel is ready to make a meaningful impact. He looks forward to facilitating ongoing conversations in the community and developing courses of action and strategies to improve the quality of life in Forest Grove.
