## Overview

The City Council consists of a Mayor and six Councilors nominated and elected from the City at large. The Mayor and City Councilors serve four-year terms of office. The Mayor and City Councilors all serve the citizens of our community in a volunteer capacity.

The [City Charter (PDF)](https://www.forestgrove-or.gov/DocumentCenter/View/838) provides for a Council-Manager form of city government. The City Council is the policy-making body of the city. They adopt laws and regulations, annual goals and objectives, and budgets that fund a wide range of public services. Council members give direction to city staff through the [City Manager](https://www.forestgrove-or.gov/333/City-Manager) who serves at the pleasure of the City Council. The mayor serves as the leader of the governing body and presides over the Council meetings. The mayor is a voting member of the Council and has no veto authority. The [City Recorder](https://www.forestgrove-or.gov/336/City-Recorder) is the clerk of the City Council.

Citizen volunteers play a large role in city government, staffing and overseeing key [advisory boards](https://www.forestgrove-or.gov/352/Boards-Commissions). Citizen involvement is encouraged and there are many volunteer opportunities available.

## City Council Rules
