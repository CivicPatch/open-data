Commission on Chicago Landmarks

The Commission on Chicago Landmarks (CCL) is responsible for recommending buildings, sites, objects, and districts for legal protection as official Chicago landmarks. Staffed by the
Historic Preservation Division
of the Department of Planning and Development (DPD), the commission is also responsible for reviewing proposed alterations to existing landmarks and landmark districts, as well as proposed demolitions of structures considered to be historically or architecturally significant. Established in 1968, the commission has nine members that are appointed by the mayor with City Council consent. Meetings are generally held on the first Thursday of every month and begin at 12:45 p.m.
