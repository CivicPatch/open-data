– Today, Mayor Brandon Johnson joined Alderman Bennett Lawson for the 44th Ward Day in the Ward event. The series of neighborhood visits is an opportunity for City leaders to connect directly with community leaders and small business owners, gaining a first-hand understanding of the ground-level needs within neighborhoods across Chicago.

“This was another great ‘Day in the Ward’ event, exploring Lakeview, visiting neighborhood gems and businesses, and meeting with residents,” said
**Mayor Brandon Johnson**

. “I am grateful to all the community spaces and leaders who welcomed my administration today in productive conversations, helping us to ensure we meet the needs of Lakeview with our continued investments in Chicago.”

During today’s event, held throughout the vibrant Lakeview neighborhood, Mayor Johnson and Ald. Lawson grabbed coffee at Steingold’s Deli, toured the historic Music Box Theatre, visited AIDS Garden Chicago, and met with local business owners at the Diversey Driving Range before attending the ribbon cutting at the
Lakeview Landing
affordable housing development.

The Johnson administration has invested $30.3 million into infrastructure projects in the 44th ward. In 2025 alone the administration has delivered $4.5 million in support for local businesses in Lakeview. This summer, the City supported 111 youth jobs for 44th ward residents through
One Summer Chicago
.

“Through our Build Better Together initiative, we are making strategic investments that create housing opportunities, jobs and strengthens the vibrancy of our neighborhoods across our city” said
**Kenya Merritt, Deputy Mayor of Business, Economic and Neighborhood Development**

. “Today’s visits showcases the momentum we’ve built and the future opportunities that are ahead.”

The Music Box Theatre, housed in a 100 year old building, was awarded a
$1.2M Community Development Grant
by the Johnson administration to expand their services and add a third auditorium in two long-vacant storefronts adjacent to the historic theatre.

The Music Box Theatre often hosts filmmakers, film festivals, and other events which attract moviegoers from around the region, but was in need of additional space to host larger events and welcome more visitors. Thanks in part to Department of Planning and Development (DPD) grant funding, the theatre will be able to host marquee events and continue its growth as a global leader in international and independent films.

Additional 44th ward businesses that have received DPD support include, but are not limited to:

* , 3121 N. Halstead St

$144,513 to renovate on-site office space.

* , 2806 N. Clark St
  $214,875.00 for restaurant renovations.
