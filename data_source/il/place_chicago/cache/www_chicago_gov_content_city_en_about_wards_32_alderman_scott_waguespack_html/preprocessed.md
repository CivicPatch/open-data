Alderman Scott Waguespack
=========================

Alderman Scott Waguespack lives in Bucktown and his family has called Wicker Park-Bucktown their home for many generations. He helped organize and coach underprivileged kids in Little League baseball at Churchill Park and basketball at Wicker Park, giving them an alternative to joining a gang. He is also an active parishioner at St. Hedwig's Church.

Scott obtained his undergraduate degree in Political Science at Colorado State University and his juris doctor from Chicago-Kent College of Law, Illinois Institute of Technology. After college, he served in the U.S. Peace Corps in Kenya where he worked with UNICEF and various women's groups to build health clinics and water supplies, and provided training in primary health. He remains active with the Chicago Area Returned Peace Corps Association, an organization that works for world peace, with an emphasis on "Bringing the World Back Home" after service overseas.

After law school, Scott helped create and implement Global Chicago, which fosters global collaboration with Chicago's many economic, cultural, and intellectual institutions. He worked on projects involving the U.S. State Department, the American Bar Association, and various governments in the Balkans. He focused on developing nation-building projects that assisted the War Crimes Tribunal in the former Yugoslavia, established a rule of law, and worked on economic development projects. Scott served as an advisor to the President of Kosovo and the interim government after the end of the Kosovo War. He is also a member of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.

Previously to becoming Alderman, Scott worked as the city administrator and chief of staff to Berwyn’s new mayor, Michael O’ Connor. As Berwyn's city administrator, Scott helped the administration introduce fiscal responsibility, saving the city millions of dollars; increased the value and quality of first responders by finding ways to fund new projects and by providing Police and Fire with the tools to aid Berwyn's citizens; and improved the city administration so that it is more efficient and more responsive to the needs of its residents.

Alderman Waguespack sits on five City Council Committees: Committees, Rules, and Ethics; Education and Child Development; Housing and Real Estate; Human Relations; and Special Events and Cultural Affairs. Scott  works with citizens, neighborhood and business organizations, our neighboring aldermen and the mayor to improve the 32nd Ward and the City of Chicago by finding solutions to the issues we all face and by providing the best city services possible.
