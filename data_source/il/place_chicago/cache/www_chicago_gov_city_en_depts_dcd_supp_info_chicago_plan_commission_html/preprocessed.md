Chicago Plan Commission

The Chicago Plan Commission is responsible for the review of proposals that involve Planned Developments (PDs), the Lakefront Protection Ordinance, Planned Manufacturing Districts (PMDs), Industrial Corridors and Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Districts.

Established in 1909, the commission has 23 members, including mayoral appointees made with City Council consent. Staff services are provided by the Planning and Zoning Division of the Department of Planning and Development (DPD).
